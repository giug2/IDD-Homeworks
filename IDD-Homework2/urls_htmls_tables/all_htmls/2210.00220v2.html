<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Research in medical visual question answering (MVQA) can contribute to the development of computer-aided diagnosis. MVQA is a task that aims to predict accurate and convincing answers based on given medical images and associated natural language questions. This task requires extracting medical knowledge-rich feature content and making fine-grained understandings of them. Therefore, constructing an effective feature extraction and understanding scheme are keys to modeling. Existing MVQA question extraction schemes mainly focus on word information, ignoring medical information in the text. Meanwhile, some visual and textual feature understanding schemes cannot effectively capture the correlation between regions and keywords for reasonable visual reasoning. In this study, a dual-attention learning network with word and sentence embedding (WSDAN) is proposed. We design a module, transformer with sentence embedding (TSE), to extract a double embedding representation of questions containing keywords and medical information. A dual-attention learning (DAL) module consisting of self-attention and guided attention is proposed to model intensive intramodal and intermodal interactions. With multiple DAL modules (DALs), learning visual and textual co-attention can increase the granularity of understanding and improve visual reasoning. Experimental results on the ImageCLEF 2019 VQA-MED (VQA-MED 2019) and VQA-RAD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. According to the ablation studies and Grad-CAM maps, WSDAN can extract rich textual information and has strong visual reasoning ability.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to intensive research in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), related multimodal learning tasks, such as automatic image annotation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, video question answering<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, cross-modal information retrieval<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and visual question answering (VQA)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, have attracted great interest. Medical visual question answering (MVQA) is a socially significant application of VQA and one of the current research hotspots in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology. A mature MVQA system can relieve the burden on medical staff, provide them with valuable second opinions on medical images, and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">MVQA requires us to answer relevant natural language (NL) questions in combination with given medical images. The complete modeling process can be described as follows. First, features are extracted from a given image and question. Second, the content of these features are understood and fused. Finally, the fused vectors are used to formulate the possible answers. Some research work has shown that because of the limitations of specialist medical concepts, challenges remain in understanding clinical texts<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Thus, text features that are rich in medical information must be extracted, but most studies have ignored this need. At the same time, previous research on feature fusion is imperfect, which hinders the model’s ability to perform correct visual reasoning and select core regions and keywords related to the answer. Yu <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proved through experiments that some dense interaction fusion schemes have low scalability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and that schemes based on multi-head attention methods are rarely applied to MVQA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Word embedding, a technique for representing words as real-valued vectors, is commonly used in text processing. Most of the text extraction work in VQA and MVQA apply this technique to convert words into question features, thereby obtaining keyword information. The bi-branch model proposed by Liu <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> uses the sum of token, position, and segment embedding as the question feature representation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, many words have completely different public and medical meanings (e.g., "<span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">patient</span>" and "<span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mass</span>"), so relying on words alone is not enough to gather sufficient medical information. Question-Centric Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear (QCMLB)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> uses skip-thought vectors<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to directly extract the sentence semantics of the question, which can obtain medical expertise but lose keyword information. As a result, the correct keywords and core areas may not be highlighted in the subsequent feature understanding process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-Modal Relation Attention Network (Mranet) obtains keyword information and semantic relations between words through word attention and self-guided relational attention, respectively. Then, the sum of the outputs of these two attention mechanisms is used as a question feature to answer complex queries<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Yang <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> added the question-type information after fusing multimodal features to narrow the candidate answer space<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The aforementioned methods can obtain more valuable information from the text. However, because of the single question type and simple relationship between words in clinical NL questions, using these schemes does not sufficiently help in extracting medical information from text. Zhan <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> designed Question-Conditioned Reasoning (QCR) and Type-Conditioned Reasoning (TCR) modules to extract close-ended and open-ended question features, respectively. Gupta <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> generated word embedding and sub-word embedding, which were used with the integer sequence of the question to obtain text features<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Although these schemes enrich text representation, they are more focused on the use of word information and still fall short in the semantic representation of medical questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Attention mechanism<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is not only successfully applied to unimodal tasks, but also plays an important role in many multimodal tasks like text matching<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and visual captioning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Recent studies have shown that learning co-attention for visual and textual elements at the same time can lead to a fine-grained understanding of the image and question, thereby improving the visual reasoning ability of the model and enabling more accurate predictions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Most works on co-attention focusing on MVQA are based on VQA, and each of these studies have flaws. Bilinear attention networks (BAN) achieved the purpose of simultaneously learning two modal attention distributions by adding an attention matrix to the bilinear model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Dense co-attention network (DCN) integrated visual and textual features by repeatedly interacting attention weights<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Although BAN and DCN can achieve dense interaction of modalities, adding depth provides minimal improvement in performance. Of course, such schemes are beneficial to MVQA at present because the dataset is quite small, but as the amount of data increases, the effect and scalability of the model is affected. Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN) proposed by Yu <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> improves the model’s understanding of image content through the synergy of question-guided attention and self-attention<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, it does not consider the image-guided attention and has not been applied to MVQA yet. BERT-based MVQA models, CGMVQA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Multimodal Medical BERT (MMBERT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, only use multi-head attention for intramodal and intermodal interactions. They are simple, but because they are learning two interactions at the same time, which weakens the effect of each, resulting in feature understanding and visual reasoning are inadequate.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a Dual-Attention Learning Network with Word and Sentence Embedding (WSDAN) for MVQA to address the issues of inadequate extraction of medical information and poor granularity of feature understanding.

We used word and sentence embeddings to obtain keywords and medical information for the questions, respectively. A double embedding representation of the question is obtained through TSE. Then, we propose a dual-attention learning (DAL) module to learn self-attention and guided attention. The fusion component consisting of several DAL modules enhances the understanding of features and improves visual reasoning by learning co-attention between vision and text.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since ImageCLEF first hosted the visual question answering challenge in the medical domain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, a growing number of researchers have participated in it and explored many methods for MVQA. Overall, the strategies used for MVQA and VQA tasks are similar, and both methods include four core learnable modules: (i) a question encoder for extracting textual features, (ii) an image encoder for extracting visual features, (iii) a fusion algorithm for combining the extracted modal features, and (iv) a classifier that selects the optimal answer among a group of candidates.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of this device is to encode the input questions, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is ofter preferred for VQA question encoder because of the excellent performance of RNN in NLP. However, it cannot obtain the complete context because the auto-regressive structure is limited. The pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert) model proposed by Google adjusts the word vectors according to the context and obtains a context-rich word representation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Although differences exist between the corpora in the general and medical domains, many MVQA studies have directly adopted pre-trained BERT to extract words as question features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, methods to create sentence embedding have led to a breakthrough in textual data representation. Ryan <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed skip-thought vectors to predict the context of the target sentence through an encoder–decoder composed of RNNs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. It can obtain vector representations and learn continuity relations between sentences but is less computationally efficient. Quick-thought vectors proposed by Lajanugen <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> convert the predictive behavior of skip-thought vectors into categorical behavior, thereby improving sentence representation and computational efficiency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Based on BERT, sentence BERT combines the capabilities of the Siamese and triplet network to create high-quality sentence representations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Image Encoder</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The image encoder is suitable for extracting visual features from image inputs, with pre-trained CNNs being the most common in VQA. The widely accepted CNNs are trained and tested on the ImageNet dataset, and researchers select suitable image encoders based on their performance. Visual Geometry Group Networks (VGGNet)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Residual Networks (ResNet)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> have been successfully applied to VQA and MVQA tasks. The main reason is that the features they extract are more general and effective for datasets other than ImageNet. Mixture of Enhanced Visual Features (MEVF) proposed by Nguyen <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> used model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and Convolutional de-noising auto-encoder (CADE) to overcome the limitations of insufficient medical data and enhance visual features, which are extracted as image coding<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As related research continues to evolve, the images provided in the VQA task become more complex and natural. They require us to detect all objects of the input image for semantic segmentation. However, the rich features extracted by VGGNet and ResNet are specific to the image as a whole, which is more suitable for image classification. Gradually, CNN detection models (e.g., Faster Region-based Convolutional Network method (Faster R-CNN)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and Up-Down<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>) are becoming the image encoder of choice in VQA. However, owing to the lack of a large-scale detection dataset in MVQA at present, most of the existing studies on image encoders are similar to the CNN classification model described above.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This mechanism has been widely used in the feature fusion phase of VQA and MVQA to help the models understand the visual content of images well. For example, Du <span id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> used visual attention to understand visual features and find core image regions associated with question words for visual-text correlation learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, in VQA, the model also needs to understand NL questions, so the model is required to have both visual and textual learning capabilities.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Lu <span id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> constructed a co-attention learning framework called HieCoAtt, which alternates learning visual and textual attention in a hierarchical manner<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Nam <span id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a combined framework for visual and textual attention learning, which draws on multiple steps to learn keywords and core regions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. However, these schemes only learn separate attention distributions for each modality, ignoring the intensive interaction between each word and object. Liu <span id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed Cross-Attentional Spatio-Temporal Semantic Graph Networks (CASSG), a multi-headed, multi-hop attention model with diversity and progressivity, to explore fine-grained interactions among different modalities in an intersectional manner<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers (LXMERT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and Vision-and-Language BERT (ViLBert)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> learned about image and text co-attention with two different Transformer components, but no one has introduced these ideas into MVQA.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fusion scheme of multimodal pooling is another common technique in VQA. The basic operations include concatenation, summation, and element-wise product, but these have mediocre performance. Fukui <span id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed to embed image and text features into a higher-dimensional vector space to aggregate visual and linguistic features and developed Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), which greatly improved the integration of visual and textual elements<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, the memory usage problem caused by the high-dimensional output may limit its applicability. Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear Attention Networks (MLB) proposed by Kim <span id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> decomposed the 3D weight tensor of a bilinear set into three 2D weight matrices, which solved the problem left by the MCB<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. But MLB is more complex and converges slowly. Yu <span id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) to sum the values within each non-overlapping 1D window and aggregate the results of multiplications between elements, thus increasing the model’s fine-grained fusion of vision and text<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</p>

As the medical images are extremely complex, similar to the CGMVQA approach, our proposed method extracts image features from five convolutional blocks of ResNet-152 to function as a detection model. On the one hand, it can make full use of image information, and on the other hand, it can help the model learn dual-attention better.

For example, on the left half of Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2.2 DAL for MVQA ‣ 3.2 Dual-Attention Learning ‣ 3 Method ‣ A Dual-Attention Learning Network with Word and Sentence Embedding for Medical Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, this part can be considered as an encoder when learning image-guided attention and as a decoder when learning question-guided attention. Both the encoder and decoder in DAL have two layers of multi-head attention that learn self-attention and guided attention.

In addition, we conduct ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of the TSE and DALs, and use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for visual analysis to explore the impact of using different guided attention on visual reasoning. We select accuracy and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score as the evaluation metrics for the model.</p>

Then, 58% of the questions in <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> are close-ended and the rest are open-ended. We train and test these two categories of data separately. <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> is manually labeled and the trained model has a higher confidence level.

The <span id="S4.SS1.p2.5.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> dataset covers the four most common categories in medical diagnosis: modality, plane, organ system, and abnormality. Of these, abnormality is open-ended, and the remaining categories are close-ended questions. We observed some “yes/no” types of questions in the modality and abnormality. To ensure comparability of experimental results and accommodate this sort of data, we created a new category called Yes/No. All QA pairs in this dataset are automatically generated by the algorithm from the image caption content, which contains a large amount of noise and useless information. Incidentally, both the <span id="S4.SS1.p2.5.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD 2019</span> and <span id="S4.SS1.p2.5.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-MED</span> test results contain the overall category and are calculated according to the following rules:</p>

Compared with WDAN(NP), WSDAN(NP) outperformed WDAN(NP) significantly in all categories and exceeded it by approximately 10 percentage points in abnormality. As reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ A Dual-Attention Learning Network with Word and Sentence Embedding for Medical Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, WSDAN(NP) has higher accuracy on the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> test set compared to WDAN(NP), improving to 63.7% on the open-ended and 80.1% on the close-ended questions. In summary, the performance of the model is significantly improved by adding sentence semantics to the use of word information. This result shows that the TSE module can be used to encode the input questions to obtain medical information-rich question features.</p>

For example, in response to the question "In which two ventricles can calcifications be seen on this CT scan?," WSDAN failed to focus on the correct location in all states, predicting wrong answers and even some answers that were unrelated to the question (e.g., WSDAN(NP) only with <math id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="F_{(V,Q)}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2a"><msub id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml">F</mi><mrow id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">V</mi><mo id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.4.3" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.3.2">𝐹</ci><interval closure="open" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑉</ci><ci id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2.2.2.2">𝑄</ci></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p7.1.m1.2c">F_{(V,Q)}</annotation></semantics></math> answered "aorta").

<p id="S4.SS4.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our WSDAN(NP) can enhance the model’s understanding of features and improve visual reasoning on closed questions by alternating learning between image- and question-guided attention and self-attention. On open-ended questions, the visual inference demonstrated is weak although the test performed better than the relevant models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We describe the performance of WSDAN(P) on <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-MED 2019</span> in detail. We find that the performance on several categories is significantly better than that of the previous correlation model, especially in abnormality. And the accuracy and BLEU score in the overall category improved by 1.8 and 2.1 percentage points to 69.0% and 71.1%, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, WSDAN(P) performed the worst in the organ category of <span id="S4.SS5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-MED 2019</span>. We attempted to guess the possible reasons, which is mainly an issue with the true label distribution of the dataset. We carefully analyzed the relevant data for the organ category and found that in the training and validation sets, "lung, mediastinum, pleura," "skull and contents," "genitourinary," "musculoskeletal," and others are the 10 types of answers. However, in the test set, another seven types include "gastrointestinal#lung, mediastinum, pleura," "heart and great vessels#lung, mediastinum, pleura#spine and contents," and others, which never appeared during training and accounted for 7.2% of the test set. In other words, the models had never been trained with these types of data, so were not aware of the visual and textual features corresponding to these answers. Thus, all the models performed poorly in the organ category. The result suggests that this dataset needs further refinement.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In <span id="S4.SS5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span>, the accuracy of WSDAN(P) improved to 83.8% on the closed-ended questions and 76.69% in the overall category, outperforming all relevant models. The accuracy on the open-ended question is 65.9%, which is about 1 percentage point lower than BiLR’s 66.48%. Perhaps the advantages of WSDAN on <span id="S4.SS5.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> are not obvious, but while most of the existing work only considers the performance of the respective models on a single dataset, we consider two datasets and achieve better performance on both of them. This result suggests that our proposed WSDAN is more general and effective, allowing for more robust visual inference.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Discussion and Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The images and texts given in the MVQA task are more difficult to understand than normal because of the knowledge associated with the medical field. Extracting medical information from the text and making a fine-grained understanding of the image and question features is key to improving model prediction performance. The medical images in the <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-MED 2019</span> and <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> datasets cover almost all organs of the human body, and the corresponding natural language questions are the most common when medical images are read by physicians. In contrast to methods proposed in previous studies, WSDAN is effective on both datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With regard to extracting richer information from medical natural language questions, most previous works only considered information about words or word combinations. In contrast to these schemes, WSDAN considers sentence semantics, aggregate words, and sentence information through TSE to extract text features that are rich in keywords and medical information. This idea may be applied to other related fields, such as biomedical text classification, which we believe could be highly interesting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we tried to combine self-attention and different guided attention to fuse modal information, and the results show that using both image- and question-guided attention models performs best. Although more effective than previous fusion mechanisms, the classification model-based image encoder limits the play of DAL. We expect to interact image objects with question keywords to fully exploit the use of guided attention. In other words, we urgently need an image detection model to act as an image encoder for MVQA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed WSDAN, a new model for MVQA tasks to efficiently extract medical information from natural language questions and explore the role relationship between vision and text. We designed a TSE module to add sentence information to each pair of word relationship models with the help of learnable projection matrices. This module ensures that the extracted question features are rich in keywords and medical information. The proposed DAL module effectively models intramodal and intermodal interactions through self- and guided attention learning. DALs can improve the model’s fine-grained understanding of features and enhance visual reasoning by learning co-attention between vision and text. We conducted comprehensive experiments on <span id="S5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-MED 2019</span> and <span id="S5.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VQA-RAD</span> datasets to confirm the effectiveness and generality of WSDAN. We believe that with further research, our approach can perform better and facilitate the development of CAD.</p>
