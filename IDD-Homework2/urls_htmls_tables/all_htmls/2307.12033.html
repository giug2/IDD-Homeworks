<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Early detection of colorectal polyps is of utmost importance for their treatment and for colorectal cancer prevention. Computer vision techniques have the potential to aid professionals in the diagnosis stage, where colonoscopies are manually carried out to examine the entirety of the patient’s colon. The main challenge in medical imaging is the lack of data, and a further challenge specific to polyp segmentation approaches is the difficulty of manually labeling the available data: the annotation process for segmentation tasks is very time-consuming. While most recent approaches address the data availability challenge with sophisticated techniques to better exploit the available labeled data, few of them explore the self-supervised or semi-supervised paradigm, where the amount of labeling required is greatly reduced. To address both challenges, we leverage synthetic data and propose an end-to-end model for polyp segmentation that integrates real and synthetic data to artificially increase the size of the datasets and aid the training when unlabeled samples are available. Concretely, our model, Pl-CUT-Seg, transforms synthetic images with an image-to-image translation module and combines the resulting images with real images to train a segmentation model, where we use model predictions as pseudo-labels to better leverage unlabeled samples. Additionally, we propose PL-CUT-Seg+, an improved version of the model that incorporates targeted regularization to address the domain gap between real and synthetic images. The models are evaluated on standard benchmarks for polyp segmentation and reach state-of-the-art results in the self- and semi-supervised setups.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection is crucial for a successful treatment: once polyps in the colon are detected and diagnosed, early treatment leads to an increased survival rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and even the prevention of CRC development <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Colonoscopies, however, are a complex screening process that require experienced medical doctors to visually explore the entirety of the patient’s colon for the detection of tissue growths in colon walls, i.e. polyps. The recent success of computer vision techniques in medical images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, makes them a potential candidate to aid clinicians during this process and through the task of semantic segmentation provide accurate information about the location and shape of polyps. While several works already explore the application of semantic segmentation techniques for colorectal polyp detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, they all rely on fully annotated datasets and ignore the main limitation of obtaining labeled samples. For the semantic segmentation task, in particular, this is a laborious process that requires the annotators, medical professionals in this case, to label every pixel in an image.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The reliance of current polyp segmentation approaches on carefully annotated datasets for semantic segmentation results in models trained on relatively small amounts of data, which hinders their scalability and generalization to new data. Recent works explore self-supervised and semi-supervised techniques to address this limitation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, few explore the introduction of synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and, to our knowledge, none explore the combination of synthetic data with semi-supervised learning. The main limitation of the application of synthetic data is the generation of a 3D model from which to generate the images, which is often very laborious, but the specific constraints of medical imaging allows for the utilization of models that simulate the structure of a particular area of the body: the interior of the colon in this case. While synthetic data has already been shown to be useful in the self-supervised setup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, its application to the semi-supervised setup is yet to be explored. This setup allows the segmentation model to be exposed to both real images and real segmentation masks during training, which narrows the gap between the training and testing distributions. Initial steps to narrow this gap have shown image translation models to be a valuable tool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> that can adapt the synthetic artificially-looking images to more realistic-looking ones. Image translation models adapt the textures and patterns of a source image to look like the ones in a target image while maintaining the spatial information of the source images.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We propose PL-CUT-Seg, an end-to-end approach to polyp segmentation that learns to adapt synthetic images to the realistic domain and generate segmentation masks that locate the polyps in an image. In particular, we address the main weaknesses of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> by narrowing the distribution gap between the training domain, i.e. synthetic images, and the testing domain, i.e. colonoscopy images. Moreu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a model composed of an image translation stage and a segmentation stage: while the former was exposed to both the synthetic and colonoscopy images, the latter only trained with the translated images and the synthetically generated segmentation masks. Conversely, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we expose the segmentation stage to both the translated images with the synthetic masks and the real images with model predictions as masks, i.e. pseudo-labels. Additionally, we propose an enhanced version of the model, PL-CUT-Seg+, and introduce an interpolation-based regularization technique that aims to reduce the domain gap between the real and the synthetic images, which results in improved polyp detection accuracy. Inspired by previous work on pseudo-label approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, we design a confidence mask that indicates which regions of the mask to be considered, i.e. the most confident predictions.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper explores the application of synthetic data to polyp segmentation under different levels of label availability. We propose to reduce the domain gap between real and synthetic data with the introduction of pseudo-labels, a careful design of the training batches, and a regularization technique that directly targets the domain gap. This approach improves the integration of synthetic data for polyp segmentation in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, which highlights the potential for exploiting synthetic data as a solution to the data scarcity challenge in medical imaging. As a result, the proposed model PL-CUT-Seg reaches state-of-the-art performance in most of the semi-supervised and self-supervised setups in the standard datasets used in polyp segmentation: Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300. Additionally, we adopt the semi-supervised learning setup in polyp segmentation as a valuable benchmark for evaluating the generalization of the approaches when the data availability is reduced.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Early approaches to polyp segmentation addressed the task from a low-level feature perspective and leveraged shapes and textures in a hand-crafted manner; Rahim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> provide a broad overview of the evolution of computer-aided medical imaging. Recent approaches leverage neural networks to directly learn from the data. The U-Net architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, for instance, has shown great success in medical tasks and has become the backbone for several works on polyp segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and other medical image analysis tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. This has led to improved architectures like UNet++ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which incorporates a modified skip pathway to reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder, and ResUNET++ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which adapts the ResUNET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> architecture initially proposed for road segmentation. More recently, Fan et al. proposed PraNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to divide the computation of segmentation masks into two parallel branches, one computing a coarse mask and another introducing the finer details. HarDNet-MSEG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is a combination of backbone and decoder architecture that, aside from producing competitive results, is very fast at inference time. Dong et al. proposed Polyp-PVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a model that uses transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> as a more powerful feature extractor than CNN-based encoders, and introduced a number of modules to specifically address the elusive nature of polyps. Similarly, UACANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> computes saliency maps at different stages of the network and introduces the uncertainty of feature maps to inform model predictions.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research has drastically improved the capacity of neural networks to learn when the labeled data is scarce (semi-supervised learning) or unavailable (self-supervised learning). Semi-supervised learning approaches can be divided into two categories: consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling approaches. The former leverage the unlabeled data by encouraging the model to produce similar outputs for a single image under different perturbations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>; the latter use the predictions of the model as labels for the unlabeled samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, initially addressed the lack of labels by using proxy tasks as a supervisory signal, e.g. predicting image rotations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, inferring color <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, or predicting relative position of image patches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Later methods, however, show a shift towards instance-based learning: these guide the training by encouraging features from patches of one image to be closer together while pushing away the features from patches from different images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

This approach exposes the model to both real-world data and synthetic data and enables it to learn features that are better suited for real colonoscopy images. The blue and red dashed lines encapsulate the labeled and unlabeled samples respectively, the green dashed lines encapsulate the domain adaptation stage, and the orange ones the segmentation stage. </figcaption>

Interpolation-based techniques have shown to be an effective solution in semi-supervised learning to reduce the gap between labeled and unlabeled distributions in the training set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and to avoid overfitting the labeled samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

The masks are interpolated following the same strategy. Unlike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, which applied interpolation training in polyp segmentation, we use soft segmentation masks where each pixel is the interpolated value of the two corresponding masks. This avoids the need to set up a threshold to obtain binary masks after the interpolation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, following recent methods on semi-supervised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, we avoid guiding the model training with incorrect predictions by using only the most confident predictions. This is often implemented as a filtering step where samples associated with lower confidence model outputs are discarded. We adapt this to the semantic segmentation setup and mask out the pixels with lower confidence during the computation of the loss. As a result, the DICE loss only considers the pixels of the unlabeled samples that are associated with higher confidence values. Concretely, PL-CUT-Seg+ only considers the pixels associated with predictions with over 0.999 confidence, for the background and polyps.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct an ablation study to investigate the effect of the techniques employed in PL-CUT-Seg+. Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Ablation study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> compares CUT-Seg with the approach proposed in this paper and evidences the effect of each of the elements introduced. Experiments are conducted on the Kvasir dataset for self-supervised and semi-supervised setups with 0%, 15%, and 30% labeled data. In particular, Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Ablation study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> shows that the utilization of pseudo-labels (“+ Pseudo-labels”) greatly improves the performance of the framework, particularly by providing the model with exposure to real-world images. Furthermore, the use of Mixup and confidence masks results in further enhancement of the performance achieved with pseudo-labels. The last two rows in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Ablation study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, correspond to PL-CUT-Seg and PL-CUT-Seg+, which show improved performance across the different levels of labeled samples. We additionally train the segmentation model on synthetic images without the image translation stage for the self-supervised setup (0% labeled samples) and obtained an mDICE and IoU scores of 56.78 and 48.22. These results highlight the importance of the adaptation stage of the proposed model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This subsection presents a comparison of Pl-CUT-Seg and Pl-CUT-Seg+ with other state-of-the-art algorithms using the Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB datasets. Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-C Comparison with other self- and semi-supervised approaches ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> shows that the proposed methods achieve improved performance in semi-supervised and self-supervised setups and includes HarDNet-MSEG and UACANet, two state-of-the-art approaches for the fully supervised setup (100% labeled samples) as a reference. The performance of PL-CUT-Seg and PL-CUT-Seg+ surpasses the other approaches when trained and evaluated on the Kvasir dataset and reduces the gap between CUT-Seg and CAL on CVC-ClinicDB. This shows the potential of introducing synthetic data in the training of polyp segmentation approaches. This is especially noticeable as the number of labels decreases, where the synthetic samples seem to have a larger impact on the model training. These results, however, also point to a limitation of the approach when training and evaluating on CVC-CliniDB alone. Our hypothesis is that the synthetic dataset is more similar to Kvasir, causing PL-CUT-Seg to be less effective in adapting the synthetic images when trained with CVC-CliniDB alone. We include this in the conclusions as future work to be explored.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, the generalization ability of the proposed approach is evaluated by training on a larger set constituted by both Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB train sets, and evaluating on the five test sets individually: Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, CVC-ColonDB, and CVC-300. Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C Comparison with other self- and semi-supervised approaches ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> shows that the proposed approach surpasses CUT-Seg, the previous attempt to introduce synthetic data in the pipeline, across all the datasets. Both PL-CUT-Seg and PL-CUT-Seg+ reach competitive results across all levels of annotations and datasets while CUT-Seg fail to generalize to certain datasets, especially in the setup with 15% of labeled samples. We observe that the additional regularization in PL-CUT-Seg+ provides a considerable improvement in most of the cases but seems to degrade model performance when no labels are available on the dataset, the self-supervised setup. This suggests that the increased difficulty of training only with unlabeled samples might require weaker regularization techniques.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel framework for self- and semi-supervised polyp segmentation that achieves competitive results in scarcely labeled datasets and successfully combines synthetic and real data. The results show the potential of synthetic data in medical imaging. Experiments demonstrate that exposing the segmentation model to both real and synthetic images is crucial for achieving improved performance. This is achieved through the use of pseudo-labels, which allow the model to reduce the gap between the training and the testing distributions. Furthermore, the results indicate that synthetic data is particularly useful in scarce label setups, where the proposed approaches PL-CUT-Seg and PL-CUT-Seg+ provide improved results compared to previous approaches, especially when generalizing across the testing benchmarks. The main limitation is the adaptation of synthetic data to specific datasets, which sometimes leads to a performance drop when training on a single dataset. Hence, we encourage further research on the generation of medical data from 3D models. We also encourage the use of scarcely labeled paradigms, i.e. self and semi-supervised learning, as a valuable benchmark to explore the generalization and robustness of polyp segmentation approaches.</p>
