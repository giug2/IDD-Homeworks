<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">In the evolving field of machine learning, ensuring fairness has become a critical concern, prompting the development of algorithms designed to mitigate discriminatory outcomes in decision-making processes. However, achieving fairness in the presence of group-specific concept drift remains an unexplored frontier, and our research represents pioneering efforts in this regard. Group-specific concept drift refers to situations where one group experiences concept drift over time while another does not, leading to a decrease in fairness even if accuracy remains fairly stable. Within the framework of federated learning, where clients collaboratively train models, its distributed nature further amplifies these challenges since each client can experience group-specific concept drift independently while still sharing the same underlying concept, creating a complex and dynamic environment for maintaining fairness. One of the significant contributions of our research is the formalization and introduction of the problem of group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart, shedding light on its critical importance in the realm of fairness. In addition, leveraging insights from prior research, we adapt an existing distributed concept drift adaptation algorithm to tackle group-specific distributed concept drift which utilizes a multi-model approach, a local group-specific drift detection mechanism, and continuous clustering of models over time. The findings from our experiments highlight the importance of addressing group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart to advance fairness in machine learning.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness is a fundamental concern in machine learning, aiming to prevent discrimination in algorithmic decision-making processes with respect to sensitive attributes, such as race or gender <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, achieving fairness becomes even more challenging in the presence of concept drift, which refers to the phenomenon where the underlying data distribution changes over time. In this paper, we introduce the concept of group-specific concept drift, which specifically focuses on scenarios where one group, characterized by a sensitive attribute, experiences changes in the data distribution while another group remains unaffected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To further illustrate the importance of the problem, let us consider a real-world example of group-specific concept drift in the context of loan lending. Suppose a financial institution operates in a region where historically marginalized communities, such as indigenous or ethnic minority groups, have limited access to financial services. Over time, societal changes, government initiatives, and increased awareness promote financial inclusion, leading to a significant increase in loan applications from these previously underserved communities. In this evolving environment, group-specific concept drift occurs as the data distribution for loan applicants from marginalized communities changes. Traditional lending models may not adequately capture the creditworthiness and financial profiles of these communities due to the historical underrepresentation and lack of relevant data. Consequently, there is a risk of perpetuating bias and discrimination in loan approval decisions. Addressing group-specific concept drift is crucial to ensure fair access to loans for individuals from historically marginalized communities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, a decentralized approach to machine learning, provides a unique setting for studying fairness under group-specific distributed concept drift. This framework allows multiple clients to collaboratively train models using their local data, while a central server aggregates their updates to create a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, the distributed nature of federated learning, combined with the presence of group-specific concept drift, poses new challenges that have not been addressed in the context of fairness. In this context, group-specific concept drift could manifest in specific clients at different times which can lead to challenges in maintaining fairness and accuracy. As such, in this work, we also introduce and formalize the concept of group-specific distributed concept drift in distributed environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Going back to the previous example of loan lending, in a federated learning setting, consider a scenario where clients representing different regions or demographic groups experience varying rates of change in the data distribution of loan applicants. For instance, a financial institution operating in a diverse geographic landscape may have multiple branches, each serving a unique community with its distinct characteristics. In this federated learning framework, if one branch undergoes changes in the data distribution for loan applicants from marginalized communities, while another branch remains unaffected, the result is a manifestation of group-specific distributed concept drift. The decentralized nature of federated learning implies that these shifts in data distribution occur independently across different clients at various times, introducing a layer of complexity in maintaining fairness and accuracy. As the financial landscape evolves and societal changes unfold, addressing group-specific distributed concept drift becomes imperative to uphold fairness and prevent perpetuation of biases in loan approval decisions for diverse and historically underserved communities.</p>

However, applying centralized algorithms to federated learning may not be well-suited for handling distributed concept drifts with heterogeneous data distributions across time and clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In their recent work, Jothimurugesan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> introduce a novel approach to tackle the challenge of distributed concept drift in federated learning. They treat drift adaptation as a dynamic clustering problem, emphasizing the limitations of single global models when dealing with distributed drifts. To address this issue, the authors propose a multi-model approach that leverages local drift detection based on the overall loss, offering a more robust solution to adapt to evolving data distributions over time. However, it is important to note that this algorithm, referred to as FedDrift, focuses on the global loss and does not consider group-specific losses. In the context of our work, where we specifically address group-specific distributed concept drift, FedDrift’s reliance on global loss renders it ill-suited for our scenario. Group-specific concept drift may not be effectively detected by FedDrift, as it does not account for variations in local models that are crucial for capturing changes specific to certain groups. This limitation underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to address fairness concerns under group-specific distributed concept drift, which we elaborate on in the subsequent sections. Hence, we draw inspiration from this work to the fairness setting and present more details about this algorithmic approach in the next sections.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While certain studies have delved into fairness under concept drift in centralized streaming environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, it is important to recognize their limitations when applied to fairness under concept drift in federated learning. These fairness-aware algorithms may not be well-suited for federated learning due to several reasons. Firstly, they typically require direct access to sensitive attributes, which is restricted in federated learning where only model parameters are shared among clients and the data of each client is kept private. Secondly, these algorithms rely on decision trees which may pose a security risk in a federated learning setting when sharing decision tree models with the server, requiring enhanced privacy and security measures. In addition, these studies primarily operate in a streaming context, with one example arriving at a time, which differs from our setup that is characterised by the simultaneous processing of multiple examples, and contrasts with the typical use of neural networks in federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Finally and most importantly, these existing works primarily concentrate on the study of concept drift affecting both groups simultaneously, rather than delving into datasets characterized by group-specific concept drift or its distributed counterpart. This limitation constrains the assessment of their approaches under realistic conditions with evolving fairness dynamics, where different groups may undergo distinct patterns of concept drift. In this work, we endeavor to bridge this gap by pioneering the formalization and exploration of group-specific concept drift in the context of federated learning, unveiling its vital role in advancing fairness within machine learning.</p>

This difference in concept drift between groups can result in a decrease in fairness, even if accuracy remains fairly stable.

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In these situations, conventional drift detection mechanisms that rely solely on overall loss metrics may struggle to capture these underlying dynamics. This underscores the need to incorporate group-specific loss monitoring over time, as fairness concerns can arise when shifts in concept drift affect opportunities for favorable outcomes across groups. It is important to note that, although studies have delved into fairness under concept drift in centralized environments, the concept of group-specific concept drift had not been formally addressed in the literature. In addition, empirical experiments to validate its impact are lacking as the literature focuses on general concept drift, overlooking the nuances introduced by group-specific variations.</p>

However, the use of global loss monitoring in their approach poses limitations when dealing with group-specific concept drift. This is because global loss may not vary significantly over time in the presence of group-specific concept drift, especially when the dataset is imbalanced with respect to a sensitive group. In this case, changes in loss predominantly occur within specific groups. Consequently, relying solely on global loss may overlook nuanced variations introduced by group-specific concept drift.</p>

The Oracle algorithm serves as an idealized benchmark, equipped with access to concept IDs during training and employing multiple-model training based on ground-truth clustering. Given the unique problem of group-specific distributed concept drift, traditional baselines for fair federated learning are absent, as explained in the Related Work section. We found that these achieve very similar results to FedAvg on these datasets under group-specific distributed concept drift, as they lack the adaptability to effectively address the challenges posed by these evolving data distributions. Nevertheless, Oracle serves as a perfect algorithm for this problem setup and should act as an ideal baseline.</p>

In this cases, it becomes evident that FairFedDrift outperforms FedDrift in terms of B-ACC without compromising ACC. This phenomenon can be attributed to the observation that in these situations of group-specific concept drift, the overall loss does not change significantly. Instead, it is the loss of specific groups that is affected. Therefore, FairFedDrift’s approach to considering the loss of all groups proves crucial. However, as <math id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> assumes higher values, the global loss undergoes more significant changes, allowing FedDrift to achieve results that closely match those of FairFedDrift.</p>
