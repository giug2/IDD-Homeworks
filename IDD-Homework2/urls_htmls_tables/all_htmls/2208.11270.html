<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">Increasing privacy and security concerns in intelligence-native 6G networks require quantum key distribution-secured federated learning (QKD-FL), in which data owners connected via quantum channels can train an FL global model collaboratively without exposing their local datasets. To facilitate QKD-FL, the architectural design and routing management framework are essential. However, effective implementation is still lacking. To this end, we propose a hierarchical architecture for QKD-FL systems in which QKD resources (i.e., wavelengths) and routing are jointly optimized for FL applications. In particular, we focus on adaptive QKD resource allocation and routing for FL workers to minimize the deployment cost of QKD nodes under various uncertainties, including security requirements. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture and the resource allocation and routing model can reduce the deployment cost by 7.72% compared to the CO-QBN algorithm.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent security threats from quantum computers are leading to a revolution in the use of quantum channels for secret key distribution, i.e., quantum key distribution (QKD), for the transmission of confidential information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In intelligence-native 6G communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, security and privacy are crucial requirements in distributed artificial intelligence (AI) training. On the one hand, federated learning (FL) enables multiple FL workers to train a global model while keeping their data local <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, QKD distributes secure keys for FL nodes to encrypt the model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, the resource allocation problem in QKD-FL remains a critical challenge that prevents the implementation of such secure communication systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For resource allocation in QKD-FL systems, researchers have proposed solutions that must be effective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, for the problem of selecting and routing among FL nodes, the authors introduced a resource allocation framework based on federated reinforcement learning, where the model transmissions of remote devices are protected by adaptive jamming. For the QKD resource allocation problem, the shortest path-based heuristic algorithm was proposed for measurement-device-independent-QKD (MDI-QKD) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, the above works solve the routing problem and the resource allocation problem separately, which leads to nonlinear and inefficient resource allocation issues in quantum-safe FL systems. Moreover, the current works on resource allocation schemes for quantum Internet mainly focus on developing static algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, while the uncertainty in quantum states and quantum communication is largely neglected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture for QKD-FL systems in which adaptive QKD resources and routing are jointly considered. In this framework, the QKD network manager performs joint optimization of resource allocation and routing policies in the QKD network to provide services for unpredictable security requirements, i.e., dynamic secret-key rates, in the FL network. To handle uncertain factors, we formulate the joint assignment and routing problem as a two-stage stochastic programming model. Therefore, adaptive decision-making in the reservation and on-demand stages can efficiently enable quantum-protected FL applications to obtain sufficient quantum secure keys.</p>

Unlike traditional QKD protocols, such as Bennett-Brassard-1984 (BB84) and Bennett-Brassard-Mermin-1992 (BBM92) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, modern QKD protocols based on MDI technology can provide longer distribution distance and stronger security without assuming trusted relays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. To minimize the cost of deploying QKD resources in MDI-QKD, Cao <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a static linear programming model and the CO-QBN algorithm to efficiently manage QKD networks. However, existing QKD resource allocation schemes largely overlook uncertain factors such as user demand for secret key rates, which is unpredictable, especially in FL networks where the FL workers can participate and leave the model training dynamically and spontaneously. Therefore, it is the aim of this paper to optimize the QKD-FL network resources with the objective to minimize total costs while meeting uncertain demand and network conditions. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed the resource allocation scheme for quantum-secured space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) in which QKD services protect secure communications between space, aerial, and ground nodes by exchanging secret keys in quantum channels. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors formulated and solved the stochastic programming model to achieve the optimal solution for resource allocation and routing under the uncertainties of the secret-key rate requirements and weather conditions.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.7" class="ltx_p">A QKD node supplies secret keys to its co-located FL node. The trusted relay and the untrusted relay are located between the QKD nodes. The QKD node consists of a global key server (GKS), a local key manager (LKM), a security infrastructure (SI), and components of trusted/untrusted relays. A trusted relay consists of two or multiple transmitters of MDI-QKD (MDI-Txs), LKM, and SI, while an untrusted relay consists of one or multiple receivers of MDI-QKD (MDI-Rxs). An MDI-QRx must be located between two MDI-QTxs to generate local secret keys. An LKM is used to obtain and store the local secret keys from the connected MDI-QTxs, and LKM performs secret key propagation via the one-time-pad (OTP) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to generate global secret keys between QKD nodes. The SIs are applied to ensure that trusted relays work in a secure manner. In the QKD layer, the QKD links are used to connect between MDI-QTxs and MDI-QRxs, while the KM links are used to connect between LKMs. The QKD link contains quantum and classical channels, while the KM link contains a classical channel implemented by wavelengths.

FL nodes (e.g., model owners) distribute the initial models to FL workers (e.g., data owners) via the cluster heads (e.g., routers). The initial model is distributed to FL workers. After the FL workers receive the initial model, they train the model locally with their own data and create the new models. Then, the FL workers send their new models to the cluster heads for model aggregation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the QKD management and control layer, when the FL nodes request secret keys for model encryption from the QKD network manager, QKD nodes controlled by the QKD network controller provide the secret keys for the FL node requests through the QKD network manager. If the QKD nodes cannot provide the secret keys, the FL nodes must wait for the secret keys from the QKD nodes. When the cluster heads receive the local models from the FL workers, they encrypt the aggregated global model with the secret keys and transmit the encrypted model to the destination FL node. Therefore, the security requirements of each FL node in the FL layer directly depend on the available secret key resources in the QKD layer.</p>

First, we consider that the proposed SP model can produce the efficient routing to satisfy the QKD-FL chain requests. Second, the deployment cost can be decreased by optimally reserving the QKD and KM wavelengths in advance through the solution of the SP model. Finally, we compare the SP model with the CO-QBN algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to show the benefits of the SP model.</p>

For the solutions, the SP model can allocate QKD and KM wavelengths (i.e., resources) in the reservation and on-demand phases for the requests in fiber optic networks.

In the first stage, we vary the reserved QKD wavelengths and fix the reserved KM wavelengths. Then, we present the optimal solution obtained by the SP model and the effect of reserved QKD wavelengths on the solution. In Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-B2 Cost Structure Analysis ‣ V-B Numerical Results ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Resource Allocation in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), when the reserved QKD wavelengths increase, the first-stage cost increases significantly. However, the second-stage cost decreases dramatically when the secret-key rates are observed. The reason is that the QKD wavelength in the on-demand phase (i.e., the second stage) is forced to be minimum by utilizing the cheaper QKD wavelength in the reservation phase (i.e., the first stage). As a result, at the reserved QKD wavelengths of 150, the optimal solution can be achieved and the second-stage cost is 0. This is because the reserved QKD wavelengths meet the demands (i.e., secret-key rates) and therefore the on-demand QKD wavelengths in the second stage are not utilized. After this point, the total cost and the first-stage cost increase since there is the penalty cost for an excess of the reserved QKD wavelength to be charged. For Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-B2 Cost Structure Analysis ‣ V-B Numerical Results ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Resource Allocation in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), we can mention that over-provisioning and under-provisioning of QKD wavelengths affect the high total cost significantly.</p>

However, the optimal solution is achieved when the reserved KM wavelengths are 50. The reason is that the reserved KM wavelengths of 50 successfully satisfy the demands. After this point, the total cost and the first-stage cost increase since the penalty cost of an excess of reserved KM wavelengths is charged. Therefore, we can mention that the high cost is affected by not only the reserved QKD wavelengths but also the reserved KM wavelengths.</p>

In the reservation phase, the QKD and KM wavelengths rise steeply until the secret-key rates are 5 and 3 kbps, respectively. This is because the reserved QKD and KM wavelengths are completely utilized at the secret-key rates of 5 and 3 kbps, respectively. After these points, both QKD and KM wavelengths are constant since the maximum available QKD and KM wavelengths are limited. The maximum available QKD and KM wavelengths in the reservation phases are constrained by the QKD service provider. As a result, to satisfy the high secret-key rates, the QKD and KM wavelengths in the on-demand phases are instead utilized. In the on-demand phase, the QKD and KM wavelengths start rising dramatically at 5 and 3 kbps, respectively due to the limited available QKD and KM wavelengths in the reservation phases.</p>

However, in comparison with the CO-QBN algorithm, the SP model can significantly achieve a lower deployment cost in different QKD chain requests. For example, with the requests of 60, the SP model can reduce the deployment cost compared with the CO-QBN algorithm by 8.15%. In addition, the performance of the SP model compared with the CO-QBN algorithm in different requests is relatively stable (i.e., 8.21%). Therefore, we can claim that the SP model significantly outperforms the CO-QBN algorithm.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed the architecture and adaptive QKD resource allocation and routing model for QKD-FL systems. First, we have proposed the hierarchical architecture for QKD-FL systems for the joint allocation of resources for QKD nodes and links to protect the transmission of FL models from eavesdropping attacks. Then, we have formulated the adaptive QKD resource allocation and routing model based on two-stage SP to obtain the optimal deployment cost under uncertainty. The experimental results have clearly shown that the proposed model produces the minimum deployment cost and shortest routing. In addition, the performance of the proposed model outperforms that of the CO-QBN algorithm by at least 7.72%.</p>
