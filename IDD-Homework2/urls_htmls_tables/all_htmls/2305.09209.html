<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of Internet and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has led to the era of Industry 4.0. This shift is followed by healthcare industries creating the term Healthcare 4.0. In Healthcare 4.0, the use of IoT-enabled medical imaging devices for early disease detection has enabled medical practitioners to increase healthcare institutions’ quality of service. However, Healthcare 4.0 is still lagging in Artificial Intelligence and big data compared to other Industry 4.0 due to data privacy concerns. In addition, institutions’ diverse storage and computing capabilities restrict institutions from incorporating the same training model structure. This paper presents a secure multi-party computation-based ensemble federated learning with blockchain that enables heterogeneous models to collaboratively learn from healthcare institutions’ data without violating users’ privacy. Blockchain properties also allow the party to enjoy data integrity without trust in a centralized server while also providing each healthcare institution with auditability and version control capability.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Ubiquitous computing, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining, has transformed the manufacturing and engineering sectors, introducing the digitized Industrial era, also known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0). With the advent of I4.0, organizations have incorporated information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide more efficient, scalable, and flexible services. I4.0 in the healthcare sector introduces the term Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0). The adoption of H4.0 in the healthcare system is argued to enable the shift from hospital-centered to patient-centered services, in which the interconnected healthcare ICTs are personalized based on the patients’ needs and integrated to produce the best patient health outcome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the benefit, H4.0 is still lagging in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data compared with other sectors in I4.0. One constraint is that H4.0 usually incorporates clients’ sensitive information. Hence, data sharing for AI model training may be constrained, resulting in insufficient data representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Thus, trained AI models may perform poorly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The Federated Learning (FL) method was proposed to overcome data privacy concerns. FL allows multiple parties to train a single global model on a centralized server using their own local data without sharing the data. This is done by sharing server model parameters with each participant. Although adherence to regulations and data privacy are enhanced using the proposed method, FL still suffers several aspects. In defining the problem, we focus on privacy preservation on the machine learning model for image classification task using FL in H4.0.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Trustworthy Privacy-preserving Hierarchical Ensemble and Federated Learning in Healthcare 4.0 with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, hospitals participating in the FL process first collect medical data from their patients and store it locally in their local database. These data are kept secret from other hospitals and external parties to ensure patients’ privacy. Then, the data are fed to the corresponding hospitals’ local model to enhance its performance. Next, local models from each hospital are sent to the cloud server to be aggregated to create a global model. Eventually, the global model parameters are sent back to the hospitals for the subsequent FL process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, FL is safer than centralized training because data collected by each hospital are kept secret by the corresponding party. However, current FL methods are still faced some practical challenges. Privacy has been an ongoing concern in FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> argued that a trained local model contains rich semantic information that can be traced back, resulting in the reconstruction of raw data distribution used for training. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> show a successful model inversion and membership inference attack that can determine whether a record was used as part of the machine learning model’s training. Hence, if exposed to adversaries, a trained local model may be vulnerable to model inversion and membership inference attacks. Data integrity is another complexity in FL. The FL model parameters sent over the network are prone to tampering, resulting in incorrect model parameter training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these issues, several existing studies have integrated blockchain with some privacy preservation methods, such as Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and Secure-Multiparty Computation (SMPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in the FL scheme. Blockchain fool-proof resistance property enables the party to prevent data tampering, while the privacy-preserving method used in FL can prevent parties from disclosing clients’ private information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the existing proposed methods consider FL schemes such as FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which assumes that all participants’ devices have similar models. This may not be the case in practice since different machine learning model structures may be employed because of differences in edge devices’ computing resources, power consumption, and storage capacity. Each institution may also have its policy, which states the machine learning model structure used in their system. Hence, when resources with heterogenous computing power are involved, efficiency is an additional practical constraint that adds to the complication of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle privacy issues caused by shared model parameters and to ensure shared model integrity, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving blockchain-based ensemble-integrated FL scheme for image classification tasks in the context of H4.0. In the proposed method, we assume that each hospital has a similar model structure. Hence, healthcare devices within the institution may perform FL using the existing FL algorithm. However, the learning model structure between different hospitals may differ. For this, we propose a weighted ensemble Deep Learning (DL) to enable the aggregation of heterogeneous model structures to produce a final global model. We use model accuracy evaluation to determine the ensemble model weights. This allows misbehaving or lower-performing models to contribute less to the final outcome. In this manuscript, we consider each entity to be honest but curious. Hence, we utilize an SMPC-based method for ensemble model evaluation across hospitals to ensure privacy guarantees of the models produced by hospitals. Finally, to ensure data integrity and auditability, we leverage the use of blockchain.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In H4.0, the incorporation of ICT devices and AI poses great challenges to privacy protection and data integrity in real-world applications. FL was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to jointly train a global model without sharing the local datasets with the global server. Intuitively, a basic privacy guarantee can be achieved by this method because the private datasets are not transmitted to the global server. However, FL alone is not sufficient to provide a privacy guarantee. This has been proven in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, where the authors have demonstrated successful membership inference and model inversion attacks, respectively, on the exchanged FL model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have incorporated a DP method in the learning process in tackling these issues. For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a DP-based mechanism to obfuscate the trained local model parameters. Although DP integration can provide a better privacy guarantee to a certain extent, there is a trade-off between privacy and model accuracy. For this reason, SMPC schemes tailored to FL have been proposed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the authors developed SMPC-based collaborative learning by combining ElGamal encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to preserve data privacy and parameter privacy without sacrificing the resulting model’s accuracy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> further enhances the privacy preservation in collaborative learning by proposing SMPC-based collaborative learning that is resistant to generative adversarial networks. This is ensured by isolating participants from model parameters. Although both SMPC-based methods are able to produce a high-performing model, it requires a high cost in calculating complex functions. Therefore, implementing the SMPC scheme while each party uses the same machine learning model structure may not benefit the party with less computing power.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, FL does not provide tamper-proof attributes to ensure data integrity. The blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger where transactions are recorded in the blocks that are connected in chronological order. It has benefits in terms of data integrity, open autonomy, nontempering, and anonymous traceability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed an incentive-based mechanism in blockchain for robust FL model updates. Specifically, the blockchain is used to store each participant’s ’reputation’ score based on their performance history. The downside of the work is that for any updates that are not classified as malicious, clients will be positively rewarded. This is also true for clients whose updates are regarded as malicious. Similarly, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> presented an incentive-driven mechanism in blockchain for FL called DeepChain. DeepChain aims to encourage parties to participate actively and behave correctly in FL training by giving rewards for their contributions. Nevertheless, the cost given for updates of each participant has yet to be considered. Hence, further investigation of the system costs and rewards profit needs to be done to ensure that clients and model owners benefit from the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While considering the privacy-preservation on the local parameter updates, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> presented a joint framework of blockchain, DP, and FL to protect data privacy in Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoTs). A DP approach is applied by employing a randomized mechanism during the local model training, producing a differentially private model update to minimize individual record identification. Smart contracts are used for parameter exchange between the participants and the central authority to provide transparency. Thus, it enhances the reliability and safety of the FL process against external adversaries. Nonetheless, a privacy-preservation method such as DP provides a high privacy guarantee at the cost of model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Author in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a secure aggregation method using Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to securely aggregate local models in IIoTs. The proposed method is able to preserve the privacy of local model parameters. However, unlike the work proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> the proposed method does not consider local model evaluation before the aggregation. Therefore, malicious updates are considered to have the same contribution to the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike the previous studies, our work does not utilize an incentive-based mechanism. Our proposed method focuses on a general model evaluation for a fair model contribution. Each participant can evaluate other participants’ machine learning models to determine how well they perform towards unforeseen data. Then, based on the evaluation, each participant’s machine learning models are weighted to determine their contribution to the final predictions. The evaluation process is handled by the blockchain nodes and recorded on tamper-proof storage. Furthermore, we utilized the SMPC privacy preservation method to preserve the machine learning model privacy while considering that each participant has different computing power. Therefore, we proposed a hierarchical ensemble federated learning, which allows participants to define their own model structure.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our work with three different setups to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The first one is the traditional centralized CNN model, where all data is collected in one database and used to train a single model. Here, we combine training and validation datasets for model training, while the testing data is used for the model evaluation. The second setup is centralized federated learning, which steps can be seen in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III-B Federated Learning ‣ III Methodology ‣ Trustworthy Privacy-preserving Hierarchical Ensemble and Federated Learning in Healthcare 4.0 with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In the training process of federated learning, the training dataset is split evenly amongst participants, while the global model is tested against the testing dataset. The third setup is an FL with a TEE-based secure aggregation scheme. For this experiment, we also used the same experimental configuration used in the second setup. Our proposed method, the traditional FL, and TEE-based FL scheme, consider the use of three participants during the training.

This is because each model receives fewer data with random distribution in the training process, making each model less generalizable compared to a centralized setup. Meanwhile, the model accuracies of our proposed method surpass the centralized setups when different models are used. This is because our proposed method utilizes ensemble weight to improve generalization and allow models with better performance to contribute more to the final results. Thus, this confirms that our proposed method does not sacrifice the accuracy of the data prediction. In fact, it increases the model accuracy compared to the existing studies. However, when a similar model structure is utilized, our proposed method produces lower accuracies compared to a centralized setup since different models can better capture a particular feature of the data compared to others. Hence, combining different models in the ensemble setup result in better accuracy.</p>

Comparing both figures, it is clear that the time taken to determine the ensemble weights on the Colon Pathology dataset is higher than the Breast Cancer dataset. This is due to the difference in the number of classes in the classification tasks, with the Colon Pathology classification task higher than the Breast Cancer classification task.</p>

We further investigate the time required for different models to execute the encrypted inference process. For this, we also measure each model’s computational cost by calculating the total number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required in a single forward pass using the Keras-flops library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-F Ensemble-Federated Learning Model Performance ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Trustworthy Privacy-preserving Hierarchical Ensemble and Federated Learning in Healthcare 4.0 with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Further investigation on the execution time for different models revealed that models with higher FLOPs, such as the ResNet18 model, require more time than the others. While models with smaller FLOPs, such as Alexnet, require less time to complete the encrypted inference process. Hence, models with less computational cost are more suitable for participants with smaller computing power. There is no significant difference in the execution time when experiments are run on different datasets, as the number of FLOPs is not affected by the change in the datasets.</p>

This is because data needs to be deployed to all of the blockchain nodes to be verified. Hence, the increase in the number of nodes means more data to be deployed. Each node also has to communicate with all of the blockchain nodes to ensure the hash values are identical before putting the transaction into the blockchain. Hence, more communication costs are required when the number of blockchain nodes increases, resulting in a longer execution time. From both experiments, we can see that the performance of the proposed model and ensemble model weights verification and deployment are near real-time.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed an architecture that enables healthcare institutions to collaboratively participate in enhancing the performance of the global model while also allowing them to define their model structure. In the proposed architecture, the blockchain provides auditability and versioning control capability for the healthcare institution while also providing data integrity during local model training and ensemble model weights tuning. Our proposed model has been tested against the existing FL approach and TEE-based secure aggregation FL with blockchain. Results suggest that the proposed method is able to perform better than the existing study and able to increase the model performance effectively. We also provided empirical data on the time consumption in executing the system, namely the time required for the ensemble weights tuning, encrypted inference for model evaluation, and blockchain smart contract deployment and verification. Results show that a negligible amount of time is consumed during the ensemble weights tuning and blockchain smart contract execution. Efficiency tradeoff can be seen during the encrypted inference for model evaluation. However, higher efficiency may be achieved by FL participants with less computing power by utilizing a machine learning model with small demand for computation. This paper assumes that all hospital participants perform homogeneous tasks and train learning models with a similar model structure. The heterogeneity of the structure is considered at the hospital level. Hence, further investigation to consider heterogeneous tasks and model heterogeneity at the hospital participants’ level is encouraged. Future studies should also explore methods to increase efficiency during the encrypted inference process.</p>
