<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables distributed learning across edge devices while protecting data privacy. However, the learning accuracy decreases due to the heterogeneity of devices’ data, and the computation and communication latency increase when updating large-scale learning models on devices with limited computational capability and wireless resources. We consider a FL framework with partial model pruning and personalization to overcome these challenges. This framework splits the learning model into a global part with model pruning shared with all devices to learn data representations and a personalized part to be fine-tuned for a specific device, which adapts the model size during FL to reduce both computation and communication latency and increases the learning accuracy for devices with non-independent and identically distributed data. The computation and communication latency and convergence of the proposed FL framework are mathematically analyzed. To maximize the convergence rate and guarantee learning accuracy, Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are deployed to jointly optimize the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FL framework achieves a remarkable reduction of approximately <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="50\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">50</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">50\%</annotation></semantics></math> computation and communication latency compared with FL with partial model personalization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for protecting data privacy and facilitating distributed learning across diverse domains, such as healthcare, finance, and mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where multiple edge devices share only the model/gradients with an edge server to collaboratively train a learning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Although FL preserves privacy, it still has significant challenges in computation and communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Data heterogeneity in different devices may lead to unstable training of FL and further result in poor generalization ability of the global model and low learning accuracy. Furthermore, devices with limited computational capabilities lead to high computation latency. On the communication side, with an increasing number of edge devices, the limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, may impede devices from effectively contributing to model aggregation, which results in high transmission latency and has a negative effect on the convergence rate and learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address data heterogeneity, personalized FL (PFL) and federated feature matching (FedFM) were considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, respectively. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, PFL based on model similarity was proposed to leverage a classifier-based similarity for personalized model aggregation without incurring extra communication overhead. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, a new PFL algorithm called FL with dynamic weight adjustment was proposed to leverage the edge server to calculate personalized aggregation weights based on collected models from devices, which captures similarities between devices and improves PFL learning accuracy by encouraging collaboration among devices with similar data distribution. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, hierarchical PFL (HPFL) was considered in massive mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. HPFL combined the objectives of training loss minimization and round latency minimization while jointly determining the optimal bandwidth allocation and the edge server scheduling policy in a hierarchical learning framework. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, FedFM was proposed to guide each device’s features to match shared category-wise anchors (landmarks in feature space), which mitigated the negative effects of data heterogeneity in FL by aligning each device’s feature space. However, PFL and FedFM in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> still need to transmit the whole learning model to the server for similarity/anchors calculation and model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the high-latency issue in PFL, FL with partial model personalization is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. This FL framework splits the learning model into a global part, shared with all devices to learn data representations, and a personalized part, fine-tuned for a specific device based on the heterogeneity of the local dataset. In each global communication round, the edge server broadcasts the current global part to devices. Then, each device performs one or more steps of stochastic gradient descent to update both the global and personalized parts and transmits only the updated global part to the edge server for model aggregation, further reducing the transmission latency. Meanwhile, the updated personalized part is kept locally on the device to initialize another update in the next global communication round. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, two FL algorithms for training partially personalized models were introduced, where the shared and personal parameters are updated simultaneously or alternately on devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors proved that through optimizing the split point of the learning model, it is possible to find global and personalized parameters that allow each device to fit its local dataset perfectly and break the curse of data heterogeneity in several settings. However, the communication and computation overheads of partial model personalization in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> over wireless networks are not explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the learning efficiency, federated pruning was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where the model size is adapted during the training/inference phase or both of these two phases to decrease computation and communication overhead. FL pruning offers benefits in model size reduction without sacrificing the learning accuracy of the original model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, model pruning was adopted before local gradient calculation to reduce the local model computation and gradient communication latency in FL over wireless networks. By removing the edge devices with low computation capability and bad channel conditions, device selection was also considered to save the communication overhead and reduce the model aggregation error caused by model pruning. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a low-complexity adaptive pruning method called PruneFL was proposed for resource-limited devices, which determined a desired model size that achieves similar prediction accuracy as the original model but with less training time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, hierarchical FL with model pruning over wireless networks was introduced to reduce the neural network size, decreasing computation and communication latency while guaranteeing a similar learning accuracy as the original model. Nevertheless, the proposed FL pruning methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are unsuitable for devices with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Therefore, designing an FL framework with high communication and computation efficiency and adaptability to non-IID datasets is essential.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, unlike FL with personalization or pruning, proper resource allocation and device scheduling also enable computation and communication-efficient FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, by optimizing time allocation, bandwidth allocation, power control, and computation frequency, an iterative algorithm was proposed to minimize the total energy consumption for local computation and wireless transmission of FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a probabilistic device selection scheme was proposed to minimize the FL convergence time and the FL training loss in a joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the Hungarian algorithm was used to find an optimal device selection and resource block allocation to minimize the FL loss function. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the communication and computation costs were minimized by deploying successive convex approximation and Hungarian algorithms to optimize bandwidth, computation frequency, power allocation, and sub-carrier assignment. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, dubbed Bayesian air aggregation FL (BAAF) was proposed to effectively mitigate noise and fading effects
induced by the channel, and to handle the statistical heterogeneity of devices’ data, controlled BAAF was developed to allow for appropriate local updates by the devices. Although the proposed device scheduling and resource allocation approaches in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> effectively alleviate communication costs, uploading the entire learning model still poses a challenge for devices with poor channel conditions.</p>

Generally, lower layers (close to the input) are responsible for feature extraction, and upper layers (close to the output) focus on complex pattern recognition.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To better illustrate the selected personalized and global parts in the proposed FL framework, we take a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an example, which is also used in experiment results. As shown in Fig. 2, CNN mainly includes an input layer, several convolution layers, several pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. In our work, the convolution layers and pooling layers are responsible for feature extraction, which belongs to the personalized parts. While the fully connected layers are used for pattern recognition, which belongs to the global parts. Model pruning in the convolution layers (personalized part) decreases the robust capability of CNN; thus, we mainly consider model pruning in the fully connected layers (global part).</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The relationship between the loss value of the proposed FL and pruning ratios on non-IID MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets is shown in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. 3 (b), respectively. The performance of the testing accuracy with increasing pruning ratio of the proposed FL is shown in Fig. 3 (c). We find that the convergence rate decreases, and the value loss increases with the increasing pruning ratio. This is because more model weights are pruned with a higher pruning ratio, which leads to a lower learning ability. The comparison of the testing accuracy of the proposed FL by alternatively (FedAlt) and simultaneously (FedSim) local updating is plotted in Fig. 4. We observe that the testing accuracy of FedAlt is a bit higher than that of FedSim.</p>

Fig. 6 (c) shows the optimized pruning ratio calculated by KKT conditions satisfying the given latency constraints. It is obtained that with increasing latency thresholds, the loss value decreases, and the testing accuracy increases. Also, the number of global communication rounds achieving convergence becomes smaller with increasing latency thresholds. This is because a small pruning ratio is selected with a large latency threshold, and more important model weights of the global part are kept to improve the learning ability.</p>
