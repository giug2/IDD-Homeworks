<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) as one of the novel branches of distributed machine learning (ML), develops global models through a private procedure without direct access to local datasets. However, access to model updates (e.g. gradient updates in deep neural networks) transferred between clients and servers can reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) offers a framework that gives a privacy guarantee by adding certain amounts of noise to parameters. This approach, although being effective in terms of privacy, adversely affects model performance due to noise involvement. Hence, it is always needed to find a balance between noise injection and the sacrificed accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose adaptive noise addition in FL which decides the value of injected noise based on features’ relative importance. Here, we first propose two effective methods for prioritizing features in deep neural network models and then perturb models’ weights based on this information. Specifically, we try to figure out whether the idea of adding more noise to less important parameters and less noise to more important parameters can effectively save the model accuracy while preserving privacy. Our experiments confirm this statement under some conditions. The amount of noise injected, the proportion of parameters involved, and the number of global iterations can significantly change the output. While a careful choice of parameters by considering the properties of datasets can improve privacy without intense loss of accuracy, a bad choice can make the model performance worse.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of computational and communicational capabilities of distributed systems, including smart phones, sensor networks, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and the rapid growth of the applications of these systems in our daily lives, an unprecedented amount of data is being produced everyday <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Therefore, utilizing these sources of rich information to upgrade features and services offered to people and organizations owning this data, without violating their privacy, is of great significance. Distributed machine learning (ML) is a promising solution in settings dealing with large volumes of data as well as privacy concerns about users’ sensitive information leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to an increasing emphasis on users’ privacy, federated machine learning techniques are widely exploited, and global models are developed by the use of local datasets available only on each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. While offering many advantages over conventional machine learning methods, federated learning (FL) has its own challenges, including expensive communication costs, systems and statistical heterogeneities, and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning (DL) is one of the most popular algorithms used in the context of ML, especially when we are willing to extract features from large image, voice, or text datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Therefore, FL can benefit from these algorithms while developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In order to optimize FL local models, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method is generally adopted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Preserving users’ privacy and data security is perhaps one of the most debatable topics in all ML algorithms. Even though the idea of federated learning was first proposed for its better privacy guarantees, several experiments have shown that detecting users’ private data is still possible from the gradient updates sent from clients to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Especially, when DL models are designed for local models, the risk of revealing training data by the access to developed models increases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Besides using cryptographic methods, such as secure multi-party computations (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, differential privacy (DP) is widely used in FL for data protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">DP tries to reduce the risk of information leakage by adding deliberate noise to data. Laplace, exponential, and Gaussian mechanisms are three fundamental noise injection mechanisms for implementing DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> presented a framework for global differential privacy, which accurately calculates the Gaussian noise required for DP. It also gives a theoretical explanation for the convergence behavior of the suggested scheme. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proved that high privacy DL models can be developed in distributed systems using selective sharing of small subsets of local key parameters. They showed that sharing only <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> percent of local parameters results in better models than non-collaborative models. They also applied differential privacy by perturbing the gradients of the proportion of local parameters selected for sharing. However, perturbing model parameters and injecting noise have a definite consequence: accuracy loss!</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the existing works on DP of federated systems inject a constant amount of noise into all parameters. This approach, although protects data, impacts the model performance. Since each parameter doesn’t have an identical effect on the model’s output, it seems that adding noise based on this difference can enhance the developed model performance. This idea may be able to address the challenge of losing accuracy in exchange for a better privacy in DP algorithms, to some extent. To the authors’ knowledge, the only work on adaptive DP is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which injects Laplace noise based on the contributions of neurons to the output. The contributions of input features are calculated from the contributions of the next layer neurons.This backward scenario, which is repeated until finding the input features’ contributions, can be both time-consuming and computationally expensive for clients, considering a large number of iterations and high-dimensional weight matrices. Consequently, the adaptive noise is injected to the contributions themselves.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">On the other extreme, there are numerous works with the terms “adaptive” and “personalized” DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which choose fixed noise parameters for each client based on the whole local database it has. These parameters may differ from one device to the other, but remains the same for all the parameters of each local model. The main concern of adaptive clipping or personalized DP methods is statistical heterogeneities between the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, however, we propose an adaptive differential privacy framework with Gaussian noise for deep learning models developed in federated learning. This adaptive approach is based on features’ and parameters’ importance. In fact, adding noise to less important features does not affect accuracy as adding noise to important features does, and at the same time, it can preserve privacy. So, we first present a solution for prioritizing neurons, which can depend on the inputs and outputs only, and then, try to distinguish the relations between perturbing important and unimportant features and the accuracy by simulations. Our main concern is to attain a balance between accuracy and privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.2" class="ltx_p">Although for an adaptive DP, it is often assumed that more noise should always be added to irrelevant features, our studies show a contrary result. The amount of noise, the proportion of important and unimportant features involved, and the number of global iterations can have significant effects on the outcome. When we add noise to <math id="S1.p9.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p9.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p9.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p9.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p9.1.m1.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p9.1.m1.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math> percent of parameters with high importance, we observe a noticeable reduction in accuracy compared with when the same amount of noise is added to <math id="S1.p9.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p9.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p9.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p9.2.m2.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p9.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p9.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p9.2.m2.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p9.2.m2.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math> percent of low importance parameters. However, when a larger number of parameters are involved in the adaptive approach, the outcome is not that straightforward. Generally, there is a trade-off between noise and accuracy. With a reasonable compromise, we can preserve privacy without a significant accuracy loss, but otherwise, it can ruin model performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Similar to all the other ML algorithms, the goal in neural networks is to find the weights matrix minimizing the defined loss function. Generally, in supervised learning, random weights will be first considered and the output will be found by these parameters through the feed-forward procedure. After calculating the error between the computed and expected outputs, gradient descent in the back-propagation mode will be used in order to update the weights of the network. Since using gradient descent for all data samples in large datasets seems irrational, SGD, which operates over randomly chosen smaller subsets of datasets, is an alternative.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are interested in developing an adaptive DP framework to lower the risk of accuracy loss. Previous DP algorithms in FL, including NbAFL, proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, tried to add noise with a fixed distribution to parameters to ensure global privacy. However, it seems selecting noise distribution based on the relevance of each feature to the model efficiency can satisfactorily enhance accuracy while preserving privacy. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, it is required to first prioritize parameters’ importance based on their effect on the model output.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Assume deep neural networks are used for training local models in FL. As noise should be added to the clients’ parameters before uploading for the server in each iteration, we cannot use feature selection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that rely on the final developed models. In other words, prioritizing parameters should be done in each iteration for every client, so that the result could be used for the selection of the noise value. FL with non-IID data will also benefit from a personalized adaptive perturbing mechanism, which works in parallel for all devices. Moreover, this synchrony of local computations on the new improved and powerful distributed GPUs reduces delays in the overall training process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Another approach for discovering feature importance is the variance-based method. The idea that weights connected to more important features undergo more change during the training process of neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, is the underlying principle for this approach. This probably is due to the fact that utilizing gradient descent for updating parameters, those parameters, having more effect on minimizing the loss function, have larger gradients. So, combing the variances of all weights connected to each input neuron through the learning process leads to a value roughly proportional to its impact on the output. Here, in the context of FL, we have several limitations. First, storing all the weights during the learning process to compute variances is computationally expensive. Moreover, clients participating in learning are not fixed and each of them can update parameters only once. Finally, we want to use the feature importance data during training for choosing appropriate DP parameters. Hence, our proposed method should work for each client in each iteration and before uplink transmission. For this sake, we assume the updated local weights are the final weights for that client and compute the variance between the new local and last global weights sent to the clients.

As the number of selected parameters increases, the importance of selective DP and prioritizing parameters diminishes. This can be due to the fact that the MNIST dataset has few important features.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented an adaptive differential privacy framework in federated learning based on prioritizing parameters in deep neural networks. It’s proved that selective noise injection can make a profound difference in the accuracy of the global model. As it is shown, adding the same amount of noise to different parts and proportions of data, although brings the same overall privacy level, affects the model performance differently. In each simulation result, we compared various aspects of the curves from the best to the worst accuracy. These results not only confirmed the validity of the two proposed prioritizing techniques,The sensitivity-based and variance-based approaches, but also can open up a new area of research for optimizing DP in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future possible research directions, the effect of intentionally adding irrelevant features between other features on protecting privacy should be checked. Perturbing these irrelevant features is also an alternative. Another approach is to choose noise distribution based on each parameter importance, rather than applying a fixed distribution for a proportion of the features.</p>
