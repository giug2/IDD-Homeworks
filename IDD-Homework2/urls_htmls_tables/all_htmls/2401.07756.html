<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the performance of federated learning over wireless networks, where devices with a limited energy budget train a machine learning model. The federated learning performance depends on the selection of the clients participating in the learning at each round. Most existing studies suggest deterministic approaches for the client selection, resulting in challenging optimization problems that are usually solved using heuristics, and therefore without guarantees on the quality of the final solution. We formulate a new probabilistic approach to jointly select clients and allocate power optimally so that the expected number of participating clients is maximized. To solve the problem, a new alternating algorithm is proposed, where at each step, the closed-form solutions for user selection probabilities and power allocations are obtained. Our numerical results show that the proposed approach achieves a significant performance in terms of energy consumption, completion time and accuracy as compared to the studied benchmarks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the last few years, the number of connected devices has increased significantly. Edge devices (e.g.,
smartphones, cameras, microphones, and house appliances) generate a large amount of data which is used to train machine learning (ML) models. However, to participate in ML training, devices need to share their personal information, often sensitive and private, with a centralized server. To overcome this issue, a novel ML paradigm has emerged, namely federated learning (FL)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In FL, devices collaboratively train a shared ML model by iteratively sending ML parameters instead of their private data. As a consequence, the users’ data is preserved and the computation load is shared between devices. However, implementing FL in real wireless networks comes with several key challenges. In fact, deep learning models train up to millions of parameters which leads to gigabytes of messages to be transmitted through limited-capacity networks. They also require intensive computation and communication operations which result in a high energy consumption. In this context, one may ask: can we devise a FL approach that encourages devices’ participation in FL training while saving wireless resources and energy?</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the communication costs, compression techniques were proposed. The objective of sparsification is to send a sparse vector of
the gradient estimates that includes only selected entries of the
vector. One way to sparsify the gradient vector is by keeping
the most impactful values of the gradient, and dropping the
others. Quantization consists of reducing
the number of digits that are used to encode the gradient vector. Another efficient FL technique suggests selecting a limited number of clients that participate in the FL task.
Many works have been proposed to optimize resources while maintaining good performance of FL. Not only partial client
participation uses limited communication bandwidth, but when
optimally designed, it can also accelerate the FL convergence and minimize the computational resources. In general, a large number of participants per round speeds up the FL convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, the limited wireless resources and energy restrict the number of users that can participate in each round. Therefore, it is important to schedule devices and optimize the wireless resources and energy accordingly. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the authors present a protocol that maximizes the number of selected clients subject to a completion time constraint. They show through multiple simulation experiments that the proposed approach improves the FL convergence time. However, the proposed selection approach assumes that all devices are equally important, regardless of their local dataset size and distribution. Also, the proposed method may exclude some devices from participation only because their computation and communication costs are relatively high. This may lead to overfitting problems as some important data samples are not involved in the learning task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure some fairness among clients, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> propose three scheduling policies, namely, random scheduling, round-robin, and proportional fairness. They compare their convergence rate and study their impact on the accuracy through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. However, the study does not account for communication and computation energies. The trade-off between learning time and energy consumption is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Other energy-efficient frameworks are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> where the objective is to minimize the energy consumption for transmission in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and for both computation and transmission in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> formulated an optimization problem that jointly considers user selection and resource allocation to minimize the FL convergence time. Since the studied problem is challenging, the authors decompose the optimization into two subproblems. The first one addresses the users’ scheduling. In particular, a probabilistic approach based on the gradients’ estimation is proposed. The second subproblem deals with resource allocation which is solved using an interior-point method. In the same context, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> aims to minimize the loss function under energy and time constraints. The studied problem formulates the scheduling decision variables as binary integers and solves the problem approximately using constraint relaxation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In fact, resource allocation problems in the context of FL are often formulated as mixed integer non-linear programming, where the scheduling/selection parameters are considered as binary variables. As a consequence, the optimization problems are non-convex, most of the time NP-hard, and therefore, challenging to solve. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are heuristics with no performance guarantee and may require a large number of iterations to converge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In our paper, we deal with this problem differently. We claim that, the binary association constraint can be relaxed. The association variables can be seen as probabilities. In particular, a user decides whether to participate in the FL training or not based on a probability distribution. As a consequence, instead of optimizing a deterministic objective function, the objective function is replaced by an expectation over the probability distribution. Therefore, since the devices’ association is not deterministic (i.e., a device decides to send updates or not by randomly drawing samples from a probability distribution), it allows a large participation of devices, which leads to a certain fairness among devices.
It is to be noted that many works propose stochastic approaches for client selection, but the proposed approaches rely mainly on information on the loss and gradient values (e.g., selecting with probabilities proportional to the loss values or gradients’ norms) and do not involve time and energy in their probabilistic selection methods.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a classical FL setup, a random subset of clients communicate their updates every communication round. However, the random selection does not provide the best performance in terms of convergence rate and energy efficiency. As a consequence, it is important to choose the selection probabilities in order to respect the energy budget of devices and improve the FL performance in terms of accuracy and convergence time. Furthermore, since the clients transmit their gradients values over a resource-limited network, it is also crucial to optimally allocate the communication resources. Particularly, the transmit powers need to be optimized.</p>

The communication time of each round corresponds to the transmission time of the stragglers. For this scenario, the proposed probabilistic selection outperforms the benchmarks in terms of accuracy. Although the expected number of selected devices per round is the same for probabilistic, deterministic and equally-weighted selections, the probabilistic property of our strategy allows the participation of different devices over iterations. In fact, even devices with a small selection probability participate in the learning task from time to time. This diversity in participation leads to high accuracy. On the contrary, the deterministic selection and equally-weighted selection achieve a lower accuracy.

In fact, the proposed selection approach aims at maximizing the weighted sum of selection probabilities. Hence, devices with higher number of weights are more likely to be selected. In our case, the weights are proportional to the local dataset sizes. As a consequence, devices with larger datasets have more chance to participate in the FL task. This improves the training time as larger number of samples is involved in the training. For the uniform approach, we observe the same behaviour as in the first scenario; it requires a long time to converge compared to the other approaches.</p>

The deterministic selection requires less time and consumes less energy as compared to its probabilistic version. This is mainly due to the reduced biased level of the studied scenario that does not require a large exploration of devices. The probabilistic version allows exploring more devices besides the most efficient ones, which may increase the energy consumption and the completion time. Finally, for the uniform selection, we observe the same results as in the first scenario.
