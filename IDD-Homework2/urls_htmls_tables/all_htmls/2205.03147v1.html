<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) for remote sensing scene has great potential in intelligent human-computer interaction system. Although VQA in computer vision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still in its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially considered for the RSVQA task. 1) No object annotations are available in RSVQA datasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region representation; 2) There are questions with clearly different difficulty levels for each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a random order may confuse the model and limit the performance. To address these two problems, in this paper, a multi-level visual feature learning method is proposed to jointly extract language-guided holistic and regional image features. Besides, a self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL)-based VQA model is developed to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. To be more specific, a language-guided SPCL method with a soft weighting strategy is explored in this work. The proposed model is evaluated on three public datasets, and extensive experimental results show that the proposed RSVQA framework can achieve promising performance. Code will be available at https://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/reasoning/VQA-easy2hard.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">IMAGES from spaceborne and airborne platforms usually cover large-scale geographical areas and provide important data bases for many Earth observation (EO) applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With the development of EO technology, there have been an increasing number of works on remote sensing image analysis, such as land use classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, road extraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and change detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, due to the specialised nature of remote sensing tasks, the ability to carry out such tasks is limited to experts in the related fields. The obtained semantic information from some remote sensing tasks is not intuitive to common users, which makes it difficult to deliver the image information to users in domain-specific applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, novel tasks such as image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and visual question answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have recently been explored for visual data. These tasks take both natural language and imagery as inputs and output easy-to-understand text in natural language. Among them, VQA has become a hot research topic in artificial intelligence community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Given an input image and a natural language question, VQA aims to generate a textual answer to the question based on image content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. It is an interdisciplinary research area between computer vision and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. It is also a challenging task that requires a model to jointly learn multi-modal representation from both imagery and language data. More specifically, a VQA model needs to learn visual representation to understand the input image and effective features for natural language to gain an answer conditioned on image content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for remote sensing data, VQA enables end-users to better understand a complicated remote sensing image and has great potential in human-computer interaction applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. A pioneer work can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where the authors created two datasets and proposed a baseline model of VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA). Although VQA in computer vision has been widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, VQA for remote sensing imagery is still in its infancy. Due to different image characteristics, VQA methods for natural images may not work well on remotely sensed images. Specifically, two main challenges for the RSVQA task are summarized as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">No object annotations available in RSVQA datasets. In computer vision, VQA models are able to make use of existing object annotations to learn features tailored to objects, which helps a lot to improve performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In contrast, there are no object annotations available in RSVQA datasets, making it difficult for RSVQA models to take advantage of informative region information.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Questions of different difficulty levels. Questions about each remote sensing image have significantly different difficulty levels. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ From Easy to Hard: Learning Language-guided Curriculum for Visual Question Answering on Remote Sensing Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows several examples. Usually, upon learning a VQA model, training image-question-answer triplets get shuffled. By doing so, the model can see different samples in no particular order and learn the task evenly without getting stuck in local optima. However, this may confuse the model and hence affect the final performance, as easy and difficult questions are in the same batch.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Aiming at the above-mentioned two challenges, our motivations are explained from two aspects. First, both holistic and region features should be well exploited to enhance visual representation for RSVQA. Though the holistic feature provides the global information of the input image, it may neglect some important details, whereas the region feature can provide more detailed semantic information, which is critical for answering complicated questions. Moreover, due to the fact that remote sensing images usually contain objects of various scales, using region representation is also helpful for addressing the scale-variation problem. To harness both two features, we propose a multi-level visual feature learning method. Specifically, the language-guided holistic image feature and the region feature are jointly learned to improve the performance of RSVQA models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Second, the model should be trained in ascending order of learning difficulty. We humans tend to learn from easy to hard. Inspired by the human learning process, self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL) is explored in this work and shows promising results. It considers question attributes and model feedback to dynamically adjust the question sequence for model training in ascending order of difficulty <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, namely, from easy samples to hard ones. Albeit successful in many problems, SPCL for the RSVQA task still remains under explored.</p>

However, softly-attended visual features are still holistic representations of the image. The detailed region information is neglected by these methods, which is critical for alleviating the scale-variation problem in the RSVQA task.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To leverage the object-level semantic information of the input image, patch-based and object-based feature learning methods are proposed to extract more representative local features. For VQA models in computer vision, object detectors are usually used to represent the image as a collection of bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with VQA for natural imagery, the research for RSVQA is still in its early stage. The first work for VQA on remote sensing data was introduced by Sylvain et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where an template-based automatic method was designed to build two remote sensing-oriented datasets. The image-question-answer triplets of the two datasets were constructed via the information from OpenStreetMap and pre-defined templates. They employed a CNN to extract visual features and an RNN to learn language features. After the point-wise fusion of the multimodal features, an answer is predicted by a classification task. This work paves the way for RSVQA by providing datasets and a baseline method for further research. However, due to unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery, more specific feature learning algorithms need to be investigated and explored for this task.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As can be seen, different image regions and spatial contexts need to be employed to answer various types of questions. Thus, we propose to combine holistic (global) and region (local) features to learn multi-level visual representation with multiple spatial contexts. Specifically, CGA is designed to extract global visual features with the guidance of language. CGA utilizes language features as the guidance to generate global attention maps on the whole image. Meanwhile, the CST module is proposed to extract region features in an adaptive way. CST learns to spatially transform feature maps to be of different scales and poses, and the transformed features can be used to enhance visual representations. Details of the two proposed modules are illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Multi-level Visual Feature Learning with Multiple Spatial Contexts ‣ III Methodology ‣ From Easy to Hard: Learning Language-guided Curriculum for Visual Question Answering on Remote Sensing Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and are introduced in the following subsections.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Attention mechanism has shown its effectiveness in many computer vision tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. This is mainly because focusing on some important regions of an image can improve the discriminability of visual features. For object recognition or semantic segmentation tasks, only one modality, i.e., vision, is input to the model, and self-attention is used. However, there are two modalities in our case. Therefore, we propose a cross-modal global attention, i.e., CGA, which exploits the language feature as guidance to generate global attention maps on all locations.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Attention mechanism can make model focus on informative image features by using soft weights. However, it is still a global feature learning method with a fixed spatial context. Compared with global features, multi-level features are more effective. Therefore, we propose a cross-modal spatial transformer, i.e., our CST module, to extract features with adaptive scales and spatial contexts. The spatial transformation in CST includes cropping, translation, and scaling, which can be learned in an end-to-end manner without object annotations. As opposed to the <span id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft attention</span> in CGA module, the CST module can be viewed as a <span id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hard attention</span> method for region feature learning.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional stochastic training strategy usually takes the input samples in a random order, while this is opposite to the learning process of human. Curriculum learning (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, self-paced learning (SPL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and SPCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> are proposed as more reasonable training algorithms for machine learning models. The core idea of them is to train a model starting from easy samples and gradually including hard ones. Previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> show that designing proper ranking functions to organize training samples in ascending order of learning difficulty is helpful for improving the model performance. Since there exist questions with different difficulty levels for the same remote sensing image, training an RSVQA model from easy to hard is a more reasonable strategy.</p>

SPL can be reformulated as an optimization problem, and the curriculum is dynamically adjusted according to model feedback during the training phase. The curriculum in CL is determined by prior knowledge, which is a prejudgment about the difficulty level of a specific task.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">However, SPL does not incorporate prior knowledge in the learning process. In the initial stage, the network weights are still randomly initialized, and the loss values of easy and hard examples may not be accurate to determine the true difficulty order. Thus, incorporating prior knowledge is necessary in our case. Inspired by CL, we design a curriculum, namely, a ranking function to organize questions in an easy-to-hard order at the beginning of training. By combining SPL with CL, the proposed language-guided SPCL method for RSVQA can take advantages of these two learning regimes.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the proposed RSVQA framework, we conduct experiments on three public datasets. Two of these are released by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>: the low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) RSVQA datasets. LR dataset is based on Sentinel-2 images at 10 m resolution. It contains 772 images of size 256×256 and 77,232 question-answer pairs. Among them, there are 23,002 (29.78%) pairs for the count question type, 22,882 (29.63%) for presence, 30,576 (39.59%) for comparison, and 772 (1.00%) for rural/urban. Overall, 77.8%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of original tiles are divided into the training set, validation set and test set, respectively. HR dataset is collected from high resolution orthoimagery data at 15 cm resolution. It consists of 10,659 images of size 512×512 and a total number of 1,066,316 question-answer pairs. Specifically, there are 277,702 (26.04%) pairs for count, 278,335 (26.10%) for presence, 353,772 (33.18%) for comparison, and 156,507 (14.68%) for area. In general, 61.5%, 11.2%, 20.5%, and 6.8% of original tiles are split into the training set, validation set, test set 1, and test set 2, respectively.</p>

It is created on top of five existing datasets including UC-Merced (UCM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, Sydney <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, AID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, HRRSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, and DOTA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. RSIVQA utilizes two types of annotation methods: manual annotation and automatic generating. In total, this dataset contains more than 110,000 VQA triplets. According to the answer type, these triplets can be divided into three types: yes/no, number, and others. Following the experimental setting described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, we randomly sample 80%, 10%, 10% of all triplets as the training set, validation set and test set, respectively.</p>

For methods without multi-level feature learning, we make use of 150 epochs and 35 epochs to train the models on the LR and HR datasets, respectively. Since more epochs are needed for models with the multi-level feature learning module to converge, 300 epochs on the LR dataset and 70 epochs on the HR dataset are used for these models.</p>

Note that the same language feature embedding network is used in both the baseline and the proposed framework. As for the visual feature learning module, we employ the proposed CST and CGA modules. Additionally, the traditional cross entropy loss is replaced by the proposed SPCL loss function to enable the easy-to-hard learning strategy. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed modules, we exploit accuracy with respect to question type, average accuracy, and overall accuracy as evaluation metrics. Each model is trained 3 times in every experiment (except for the results in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-C Comparisons on the LR Dataset ‣ IV Experiments ‣ From Easy to Hard: Learning Language-guided Curriculum for Visual Question Answering on Remote Sensing Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>), and the mean and standard deviation are reported on both datasets.</p>

An improvement of 3.27% in average accuracy can be achieved. In addition, the proposed method improves overall accuracy by 4.01%. We also find that much greater performance is obtained for all question types. Especially for comparison type, there is an improvement of about 6% in accuracy compared with the baseline method. These results indicate that multi-modal visual feature learning and SPCL training strategies can enhance the performance of RSVQA.</p>

Note that this model does not include the MLL feature learning module. In this figure, the proportions of training samples for four question types are compared in detail. At the first 15 epochs, CL is used to initialize the weight vector <math id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{v}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒗</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝒗</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">\bm{v}</annotation></semantics></math>. Thus, the proportions of count and comparison question types are obviously smaller than those of rural/urban and presence.

From this figure, it can be clearly observed that easy questions can achieve higher precisions at the first 15 epochs. Afterwards, the precisions of more difficult question types are improved rapidly. Moreover, we can see that the precisions of easy question types are not affected by adding more difficult training samples.</p>

The second column of the figure shows that global attention mechanism learns to focus on important pixels of remote sensing images.

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the proposed framework more comprehensively, the following two ablation studies are conducted to explore the effect of different sub-modules. Specifically, to show the superiority of multi-level visual features, CGA and CST modules are compared separately. Quantitative results are presented in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-C Comparisons on the LR Dataset ‣ IV Experiments ‣ From Easy to Hard: Learning Language-guided Curriculum for Visual Question Answering on Remote Sensing Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. The performance of the model with CGA on three question types is better than that of the baseline method except rural/urban type, which indicates that cross-modal global attention mechanism can be used to enhance the distinguishability of visual features. Since the cross-modal spatial transformer enables more flexible visual feature extraction, the model with CST can achieve better results (except rural/urban type) than both baseline method and the model with CGA. Finally, by combining both modules, MLL model obtains better or competitive performance among these competing methods. This demonstrates the superiority of using multi-level visual features in the RSVQA task.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, two challenges for the RSVQA task are addressed. First, there are no object annotations available in RSVQA datasets, while these annotations can provide rich semantic information for answering questions. Aiming at this challenge, a multi-level visual feature learning method is proposed to jointly learn the language-guided holistic feature and region feature. Specifically, CGA and CST modules are devised to extract flexible visual features with different spatial contexts.
Second, questions in RSVQA datasets are with clearly different difficulty levels for the same remote sensing image. Directly training a model with questions in a random order may confuse the model and limit the performance. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a language-guided SPCL method with a soft weighting strategy to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public RSVQA datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>
