<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) is fundamentally compositional in nature, and many questions are simply answered by decomposing them into modular sub-problems. The recent proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) employ this strategy to question answering, whereas heavily rest with off-the-shelf layout parser or additional expert policy regarding the network architecture design instead of learning from the data. These strategies result in the unsatisfactory adaptability to the semantically-complicated variance of the inputs, thereby hindering the representational capacity and generalizability of the model. To tackle this problem, we propose a <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>emantic-aware mod<span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>lar ca<span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P</span>sul<span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">E</span> <span id="id6.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R</span>outing framework, termed as SUPER, to better capture the instance-specific vision-semantic characteristics and refine the discriminative representations for prediction. Particularly, five powerful specialized modules as well as dynamic routers are tailored in each layer of the SUPER network, and the compact routing spaces are constructed such that a variety of customizable routes can be sufficiently exploited and the vision-semantic representations can be explicitly calibrated. We comparatively justify the effectiveness and generalization ability of our proposed SUPER scheme over five benchmark datasets, as well as the parametric-efficient advantage. It is worth emphasizing that this work is not to pursue the state-of-the-art results in VQA. Instead, we expect that our model is responsible to provide a novel perspective towards architecture learning and representation calibration for VQA.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a challenging interdisciplinary research problem over the past few years. It targets at correctly answering a natural language question about a given image. With the increasing prosperity of both computer vision and natural language processing communities, numerous well-designed approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> have been devised towards this task. Thereinto, the mainstreaming methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> design an adaptive network to improve the representational capacity and generalizability of the model. In these methods, they reason the answer by parsing questions into linguistic substructures and assembling question-specific modular networks from collections of function-specific modules.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2207.10404/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="221" height="84" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Given the image-question pairs embodying different visual scenes, our proposed scheme is inclined to activate different routes. Moreover, the semantically-complicated image-question pairs (Q2) are generally handled with more sophisticated reasoning routes, which simulates the decision-making process of our human brain.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite their promising performance, these adaptive-designed approaches still exhibit the following fundamental limitations: 1) they rely on vulnerable off-the-shelf language parsers or expert policies which are not specially designed for the language and vision task, and the network layout is guided by these additional supervision rather than learning from the input data. Therefore, they lack the adaptability to diverse vision-semantic distributions in the real-world settings and hence may be invalid. 2) Beyond that, the devised composable function-specific modules in these methods are restricted to reasoning the simple scene from synthesized datasets with low variability, such as CLEVR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which might not be well adapted to more complicated visual scene.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We argue that, the key to tackling aforementioned issues is to unify the compact network structure and powerful modules into a dynamic data-driven setting. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, given a question that can be answered simply by visual recognition, the model should accurately give the answer “computer” without complex reasoning routes. As to the second question which needs more delicate reasoning, it requires the model to first infer the visual scene of skiing according to the contextual information, such as “sun”, “people”, and “snow”, and then leverage the related knowledge (e.g., goggles, used for, skiing) as an auxiliary information to reply. In the ideal scenario, the model should be capable of choosing specific processing routes when handling diverse inputs for the needs of flexible and explicit reasoning.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of this, inspired by the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_italic">dynamic routing</span> in <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CapsNet</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, we devise a <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>emantic-aware mod<span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>lar ca<span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P</span>sul<span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">E</span> <span id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R</span>outing network, abbreviated as SUPER, to better accommodate the semantically-complicated variance of different image-question pairs and discriminate the instance-specific vision-semantic representation. As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-B1 SUPER Layer ‣ III-B SUPER Network ‣ III Our Proposed Method ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (a), the SUPER network treats image region features as underlying capsules and reasons the visual scene with respect to a question via iterating through a shared SUPER layer. In terms of the SUPER layer, three reciprocal components are sequentially deployed for delicate capsule modulation, thereby obtaining the discriminative representations for answering. To be specific, the capsules first undergo the semantic-aware modular routing, wherein five specialized modules are configured in parallel for powerful visual modulation in VQA, as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-B1 SUPER Layer ‣ III-B SUPER Network ‣ III Our Proposed Method ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (c). Meanwhile, a dynamic router is integrated into each module to derive the data-dependent paths for modulation. Beyond that, we construct the dense-connected paths among these modules in two adjacent time iterations such that a variety of customizable routes can be sufficiently exploited. After processing by the modular routing, these modulated capsules are aggregated by the gating agreements, which further determines the importance of these capsules to the answer. Beyond that, to further preserve and rectify the discriminative clues favorable for answering, a memory-augmented component is intentionally employed.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The VQA task requires co-reasoning over both the visual content and question to infer the correct answer, which can be categorized into two groups: conventional VQA and knowledge-required VQA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For conventional visual questions, the pioneer studies embed the visual and question features into a common space by various multimodal embedding techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> first proposed Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), which utilizes bilinear pooling to enhance the multi-modal representation, yet it brings high computational cost. Compared to MCB, Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> obtains more compact features using the Hardamard product operation and achieves strong performance with lower computational cost. Different from above embedding-based models, Anderson <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> first introduced a Bottom-Up and Top-Down attention mechanism, which assigns a distinctive attention distribution on detected image objects for efficiently answering. This technique has been widely applied in recent studies  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, boosting the performance of a series of VQA models. For instance, BAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> adopts the bilinear attention between the image objects and question words, which could fuse two modalities seamlessly. Moreover, DFAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduces the self-attention and cross-attention layer into VQA, where the intra- and inter-modality interactions are both effectively modeled.
Orthogonal to these attention-based studies, a series of delicate relation-based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> are proposed to enhance the contextual visual representation by exploring the visual relations between image objects. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a graph learner is introduced to reason the relation representation through the pairwise attention modeling and spatial graph convolution. To further model multi-type inter-object interactions, ReGAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> considers both explicit and implicit relations to enrich the visual representation.</p>

Initially, Wang <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> introduced a fact-based VQA task, which provides a close-domain knowledge of facts and associates each question with a supporting-fact.

Specifically, an underlying capsule can be activated if its represented property are pivotal to the prediction, and it can be further routed to the overlying capsules iteratively to solve the problem. Due to the advantage of local pattern activation and the combination of capsule networks, some variants and applications of it have been explored recently.

Five specialized modules are devised in the semantic-aware modular routing, and the dense-connected paths are constructed among these modules in two adjacent time iterations to form a routing space, and we only mark the activated paths in red.

In terms of modular routing, a series of specialized modules are tailored to implement delicate visual modulation, which will be elaborated in subsection 3.3. To fully explore the respective advantages of each module, they are intentionally configured in a parallel manner. Besides, to derive the instance-specific modulation routes, we construct the dense-connected paths between these modules in two adjacent time iterations while provide a router for each module. Owing to this, each module has the chance to receive the output of all the modules in the last iteration, improving the flexibility and variety of the routing process. Moreover, considering that capsules embodying different semantic information tend to activate different routes for modulation, we adopt a <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_italic">data-dependent</span> vector as the router,</p>

It targets at enhancing the knowledge representations of each capsule. Considering that the visual feature and the knowledge feature contribute distinctively to the answer for different questions, thus we formulate an adaptive knowledge-augmented strategy for capsule modulation. Specifically, we first measure the pairwise affinity between these capsules and knowledge features, and then depict the difference between the capsules and knowledge context of them as a gating control for modulation.
We summarize the above process as follows,</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The two categories of VQA datasets are elaborated as follows. The conventional VQA datasets contain: 1) VQA v2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, the most commonly used VQA benchmark dataset. The images are from the Microsoft COCO dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, and each question has ten answers from different annotators. According to the question types, the answers are accordingly divided into three categories: <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Yes/No</span>, <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Number</span>, and <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Other</span>. Beyond that, the dataset is split into <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">train</span>, <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">val</span>, and <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test</span> (or <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test-std</span>) splits, and 25 % of the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test-std</span> set is reserved as the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test-dev</span> set. 2) VQA-CP v2, curated from the VQA v2 dataset, which is developed to evaluate the question-oriented bias reduction ability and the generalization ability in VQA models. Due to the significant difference of distribution between the train set and the test set, the VQA-CP v2 dataset is much more challenging than the VQA v2.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The knowledge-required VQA datasets contain: 1) OK-VQA  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the largest knowledge-based VQA dataset with more than 14K open-ended visual questions, which requires the open commonsense knowledge to reason and answer. The questions are divided into eleven categories: Vehicles and Transportation (VT); Brands, Companies, and Products (BCP); Objects, Material, and Clothing (OMC); Sports and Recreation (SR); Cooking and Food (CF); Geography, History, Language, and Culture (GHLC); People and Everyday Life (PEL); Plants and Animals (PA); Science and Technology (ST); Weather and Climate (WC); and Other. And 2) FVQA  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, consisting of five data splits, each of which has more than 2K images and 5K questions, and each question-answer sample is accompanied by a piece of ground-truth fact retrieved from a given knowledge base.

We can observe that our SUPER model achieves the second best performance, substantially surpassing the most baselines. In particular, as the canonical neural module network, N2NMN and XNM-Net reason the visual scene by assembling a collections of function-specific modules at the mercy of the question-based layout generator. As can be seen from the table, our SUPER prominently outperforms them by 4.03 % and 1.78 % on the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test-std</span> set, respectively, which demonstrates our superiority of the modular routing mechanism and powerful specialized modules over NMN-based models in terms of reasoning the real scene. Inspiringly, our method is comparable to the multi-layer attention-based model MCAN, wherein several self-attention and cross-attention layers are cascaded for deeper vision-semantic modeling. Beyond that, we are comparable to several formidable pretrained models in the VQA task, and the related comparison results can be found in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-D3 Memory Reactivation ‣ IV-D Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

Specifically, Mucko <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> adopts a modality-aware heterogeneous stacked graph convolutional network for complementary evidence exploration. This model employs the static pre-defined graph network for relational reasoning, which may sufficiently exploit more reasoning patterns. Nevertheless, with fewer parameters, our model outperforms Mucko by 0.86%, which demonstrates the potential of our semantic-aware modular routing rationale towards flexible and delicate reasoning.</p>

In addition, DC-GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> supports intra- and inter-modality deep interactions, where its dependency parsing technique can effectively diminish the problem of question-based overfitting.

On the contrary, the best-performing models are those who can exploit biases in this dataset the best, i.e., models that “cheat” the best. These observations demonstrate that our SUPER can be immune to the underlying biases of dataset by learning the flexible routing structure.</p>

<div id="S4.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain deeper insights into our semantic-aware modular routing process, we visualized several results with different paths. Concretely, we employed 0.6 as the threshold to discretize the learned paths (i.e., we only show the paths that the probability values are greater than pre-defined threshold) for improving the intuitiveness. As shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-C5 Results on Visual7W telling ‣ IV-C Quantitative Analysis ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we have the following observations: 1) Simpler inputs tend to activate less paths. For example, the first question in the first row simply asks about the type of food, and it is inclined to activate only two types of specialized modules for visual modulation, which may not need much fine-grained information; and 2) knowledge-based visual questions require more <span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adaptive knowledge-augmented module</span> and <span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local semantic modulated module</span> since they necessitate more external knowledge for facilitating the fine-grained vision-semantic understanding. Taking the left second question as an example, when asked the ingredients of food, the model first attends the “cake” via <span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local semantic modulated module</span> and leverages <span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">focal context-aware enhanced module</span> to gradually reason the whole visual scene. Afterwards, <span id="S4.SS6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adaptive knowledge-augmented module</span> is activated to incorporate the facts (sugar, Isa, ingredient) and (cake, RelatedTo, sugar) into the reasoning process, for delicate knowledge reasoning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from achieving the promising performance with fewer parameters, the key
property of SUPER is that it could adaptively activate different reasoning paths for diverse inputs by our shared SUPER layer. We thus exhibited some images and visualized their path vectors learned in <span id="S4.SS6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-aware modular routing</span>. Specifically, we concatenated all the path attention learned in each iteration into one path vector, and then used the t-SNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> algorithm to map the path vector into a two-dimensional Euclid space. Afterwards, we clustered these 2D vectors into 8 groups in 8 colors. As shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-F Qualitative Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we observed that the images related to the tree (i.e., the points marked in navy blue, in the rightmost of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-F Qualitative Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Semantic-aware Modular Capsule Routing for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) and the ones related to vegetables (i.e., the points marked in carmine) can be well distinguished. These two groups are both related to green plants, however they are still wide apart. Because there is much difference in their fine-grained context semantics. Moreover, there is a large margin between the carmine points and the dark blue ones (associated with skiing), as they are clearly distinct. Our proposed data-dependent router is able to transfer these diverse semantic information to the routes selection. These results reveal that our model can flexibly activate specific paths for distinct inputs, therefore the distribution of learned paths is arguably consistent with that of the vision-semantic information.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a dynamic modular routing framework for VQA, wherein three well-devised components systematically work as a whole and reciprocate each other, for flexible routing exploration and powerful vision-semantic representation calibration. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks validate strong generalizability as well as satisfactory parametric efficiency of our proposed model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we plan to explore more applications of the modular routing mechanism in various multimodal learning tasks or large-scale pretrained tasks, making it more flexible and extensible.</p>
