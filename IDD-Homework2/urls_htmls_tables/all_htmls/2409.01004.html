<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">The IEEE 802.11 MAC layer utilizes the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism for channel contention and access. However, in densely deployed Wi-Fi scenarios, intense competition may lead to packet collisions among users. Although many studies have used machine learning methods to optimize channel contention and access mechanisms, most of them are based on AP-centric single-agent models or distributed models, which still suffer poor generalization and insensitivity to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent channel contention access mechanism that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. Additionally, an FL model training pruning strategy and weight aggregation algorithm are designed to enhance the effectiveness of training samples and reduce the average MAC delay. We evaluate and validate the proposed solution using NS3-AI framework. Simulation results show that in static scenarios, our proposed scheme reduces the average MAC delay by 25.24% compared to traditional FL algorithms. In dynamic scenarios, it outperforms Average Federated Reinforcement Learning (A-FRL) and distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms by 25.72% and 45.9%, respectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technology has been widely used in various scenarios such as video service flow, smart home, Internet of things and so on, due to its characteristics of high data rate, low latency, stable transmission, easy deployment and configuration. With the continuous development and evolution of WLAN technology, significant improvements have been made in data rate, reliability, and latency. To meet the growing demand for high-quality data transmission, the IEEE established the 802.11bn (i.e. Wi-Fi 8) Task Group in July 2022 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, aiming to develop ultra-reliable wireless networks. However, in dense environments where a large number of devices are accessing the network, the likelihood of collision increases during multi-user channel contention, leading to data loss or transmission failures, which adversely affect throughput and latency performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The existing 802.11 standard employs the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) or Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism, which combines Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) mechanism for channel contention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The EDCA mechanism improves overall network performance by providing differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) for various types of traffic. This is achieved by prioritizing high-priority traffic through the configuration of different contention window sizes and Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS) parameters, and it is widely used in Wi-Fi scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While traditional methods of adjusting the contention window can reduce collisions to some extent, they may not be optimal in all cases, potentially leading to unnecessary backoff times and inefficient use of channel resources. Bianchi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> analyzed the performance of CSMA/CA using a two-dimensional Markov chain and introduced the DCF Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism to improve system performance to a certain extent. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed an adaptive adjustment of the contention window update factor to address the issue where a fixed update factor fails to adapt to changes in network scale. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the CW value according to the number of STAs in the network, thereby increasing throughput and reducing collisions while maintaining the simplicity of the BEB algorithm. Rehman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced a collision-based window scaling backoff mechanism, which enhances channel resource allocation efficiency by selecting an optimal window size for each collided or successfully transmitted data frame.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite the improvements in system throughput achieved by optimizing the BEB mechanism, the increasing density and complexity of WLAN networks, characterized by dynamic network topologies and diverse traffic patterns, have rendered the performance of traditional optimization algorithms unstable, failing to meet the Quality of Experience (QoE) demands of users. Therefore, it is crucial to explore an efficient, practical, and robust solution tailored to the 802.11 MAC layer mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the research focused on optimizing IEEE 802.11 MAC layer mechanisms to enhance Wi-Fi network performance, machine learning methods have been introduced. Specifically, most studies leverage Q-learning and multi-armed bandit algorithms for optimizing channel access, with the aim of improving throughput and QoS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), as a powerful machine learning technique, has been extensively applied for the dynamic adjustment of MAC layer parameters such as the contention window, owing to its efficient decision-making capabilities in complex environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, the architectures used in these studies are primarily categorized into single-agent and distributed multi-agent. Single-agent architectures are suitable for simple scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, whereas distributed multi-agent architectures exhibit better scalability and robustness in densely deployed environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These studies typically focus on performance metrics such as network throughput, latency, and fairness, with fairness as an increasingly important criterion for evaluating algorithmic performance, especially in multi-user environments. Nevertheless, the centralized training methods involved in these studies often incur substantial over-the-air overhead and raise concerns regarding the data privacy of STAs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Given that wireless network environments are typically characterized by distributed and dynamic properties, relying solely on the local learning models of STAs may not adequately capture the global information of the entire network. This limitation can lead to a degradation in overall network performance and reduced fairness among devices. To address these challenges, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed the application of Federated Learning (FL) for optimizing communication networks. FL allows individual network STAs to train models locally and upload the model parameters to a central server for aggregation. This approach provides more accurate and reliable model training and estimation in dynamic and frequently changing wireless network environments, reduces communication overhead, and enhances the robustness and accuracy of the model. Consequently, FL has emerged as an effective solution to the issues faced by centralized training approaches in current wireless networks. Zhuang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a novel enhanced multi-access mechanism based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and FL, achieving fairness among users through the application of FL. Ali et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduced a collaborative machine learning algorithm utilizing the Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, where the decentralized strategy based on FRL improved system fairness and reliability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, in the aforementioned schemes, FL typically adopts an averaging algorithm for aggregation, with all STAs participating in the process, without considering the variations in STA-to-AP distance, channel quality, and sample quantity that may arise in dynamically dense distributed Wi-Fi environments. These differences can result in certain STAs being unsuitable for FL model training. If STAs with insufficient training time or poor-quality samples participate in the aggregation, the overall model performance may be compromised. To enhance the FL efficiency and ensure data diversity and model generalization capability, it is necessary to design a reasonable pruning strategy for FL model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose an Exponential Aggregation-based Federated Reinforcement Learning (E-FRL) intelligent channel contention access method, along with a pruning strategy to alleviate the burden on global aggregation during model training.

The DDPG algorithm is an ideal choice for addressing Wi-Fi contention window optimization problems due to its ability to handle continuous action spaces, its efficient policy optimization capabilities, and its adaptability to complex environments. DDPG is based on deterministic policy gradients and incorporates deep neural networks and experience replay mechanisms. The algorithm comprises four main components: the Actor network, the Critic network, the Target Actor network, and the Target Critic network. At each time step, the Actor network selects and executes an action based on the current state, and the result is stored in an experience replay buffer. The Critic network randomly samples from the replay buffer to update its value function, improving it by minimizing the error between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value. The Actor network, in turn, optimizes the policy by maximizing the Q-value predicted by the Critic network.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The E-FDL algorithm adopts an FL framework, where the FL process is periodic, primarily consisting of a local training phase and an aggregation phase. During the local training phase, each STA interacts with its environment independently, completing sample storage and model training. In the aggregation phase, the AP selects STAs for aggregation based on state parameters such as distance and channel quality. The selected STAs upload their model weight parameters to the AP, which then calculates the model parameters using a weighted aggregation algorithm defined by itself, resulting in a global model. This global model is subsequently distributed to the STAs participating in that round of aggregation. It is important to note that, given the relatively small data size of the model parameters, the overhead of uploading these parameters to the AP and the subsequent distribution of the global model to each STA is neglected in this paper. The algorithm’s process is detailed in Algorithm 1.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By introducing the FL framework, we aggregate the parameters of each agent within the distributed algorithm, thereby preventing unfair competition among STAs that could result in overly aggressive decision-making. The inclusion of FL not only enhances the overall fairness of the system but also optimizes resource allocation among STAs, thereby improving the system’s latency performance as a whole.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most FL schemes aimed at Wi-Fi optimization, a simple averaging method is typically used to aggregate local models to form a global model. However, this kind of approach does not fully consider the impact of the number of samples from each STA on the aggregation process, which may lead to a decline in model performance. In supervised learning, the FedAvg aggregation mechanism is commonly used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, where the aggregation model is weighted based on the proportion of each STA’s samples to the total sample size. However, this direct weighting method based on sample size also has limitations and may not fully address the issue of aggregation interference caused by insufficient sample sizes. This is especially problematic when sample sizes are low, as it can introduce noise and degrade the performance of the global model. Therefore, we introduce an exponential-based aggregation method to calculate the weight <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta_{n}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">β</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">n</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛽</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑛</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\beta_{n}</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We validated the algorithm’s performance by evaluating the system’s total throughput and average MAC delay. Two scenarios were considered: a static scenario where the distance between the AP and STA varies and the upstream traffic arrival rate of the STA is fixed; and a dynamic scenario where STAs with fixed and random traffic coexist. We first compared the proposed algorithm in a static scenario with a baseline without model pruning strategy to demonstrate the impact of the model pruning strategy on the FL training process and model performance, laying the foundation for subsequent dynamic scenario testing. Then, in the dynamic scenario, we compared the performance of the proposed E-FRL scheme with three baselines: Average Federated Reinforcement Learning (A-FRL), DRL, and RTS/CTS. A-FRL uses the FedAvg algorithm for FL model aggregation. In the DRL algorithm, each STA performs distributed training completely independently, without any FL aggregation process. RTS/CTS uses the traditional DCF method, sending RTS and CTS frames to reduce collisions and improve data transmission reliability.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes an intelligent channel competition access mechanism based on federated deep reinforcement learning, aiming to address the performance issues caused by channel competition in densely deployed WLANs. For a distributed Wi-Fi scenario with a single AP and multiple STAs, by introducing FL to enhance overall system fairness, the proposed method also fully considers dynamically changing channel quality and STA uplink traffic, introducing a pruning strategy and an exponential aggregation algorithm to effectively reduce unnecessary global model training, lower communication overhead, and improve the quality of data during training. This ensures the stability and accuracy of model training. Simulation results show that compared with traditional machine learning methods, the proposed scheme not only reduces MAC average delay but also demonstrates higher adaptability and robustness in practical applications.</p>
