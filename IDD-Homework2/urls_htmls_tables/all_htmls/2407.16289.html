<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) for face recognition aggregates locally optimized models from individual clients to construct a generalized face recognition model. However, previous studies present two major challenges: insufficient incorporation of self-supervised learning and the necessity for clients to accommodate multiple subjects. To tackle these limitations, we propose FedFS (Federated Learning for personalized Face recognition via intra-subject Self-supervised learning framework), a novel federated learning architecture tailored to train personalized face recognition models without imposing subjects. Our proposed FedFS comprises two crucial components that leverage aggregated features of the local and global models to cooperate with representations of an off-the-shelf model. These components are (1) adaptive soft label construction, utilizing dot product operations to reformat labels within intra-instances, and (2) intra-subject self-supervised learning, employing cosine similarity operations to strengthen robust intra-subject representations. Additionally, we introduce a regularization loss to prevent overfitting and ensure the stability of the optimized model. To assess the effectiveness of FedFS, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the DigiFace-1M and VGGFace datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous methods.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning interest in safeguarding personal data, a concern further emphasized by Article 25 of the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Truong et al.(2021)Truong, Sun, Wang, Guitton, and Guo</a>]</cite>, which mandates heightened data protection measures throughout system development and prohibits the unauthorized collection of personal information. Consequently, safeguarding personal information during the training of deep-learning networks has emerged as a paramount concern.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Face recognition has garnered considerable attention due to its efficacy in identifying individuals. This method finds widespread application in user authentication and has even found integration into smartphones to safeguard personal information or financial transactions. However, a significant portion of face recognition models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kim et al.(2022)Kim, Jain, and Liu</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kim et al.(2020)Kim, Han, Park, Baek, Shin, Han, and Choi</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li et al.(2021)Li, Xi, Zhang, Feng, Han, Liu, Ding, and Liu</a>]</cite> are typically hosted on servers, necessitating the transmission of facial images from smartphones for authentication, which raises privacy concerns. To address this issue, the adoption of lightweight models directly on smartphones has been proposed. Nonetheless, limitations persist in training these models solely using public data. Consequently, there is a growing interest in training models to utilize users’ facial data on their own devices while ensuring data privacy, with many studies leveraging federated learning methods garnering attention in this regard.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a method in which multiple clients join together to train a model with good performance while protecting personal information. FedFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Aggarwal et al.(2021)Aggarwal, Zhou, and Jain</a>]</cite> introduced a spread-out regularizer aimed at training a face recognition model within a federated learning framework. However, the process of dispersing the identity proxies received from clients in FedFace raises concerns regarding potential privacy violations. FedFR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al.(2022)Liu, Wang, Chien, and Lai</a>]</cite> prevented bias by training personalized models using public data, demonstrating promising performance among federated learning-based face recognition models. However, this approach necessitates clients to continuously receive public data, posing significant resource constraints, especially in on-device environments like mobile platforms where computational resources are severely limited. Additionally, FedFR proposed a new evaluation metric for personalizing performance, but this metric is far from real-world situations because the number of clients is too small and one client holds multiple identities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose FedFS, which trains generalized facial features and personalized face recognition model without leaking personal data outside each user’s device in a federated learning environment. FedFS has three models: a pre-trained model trained with public data, a personalized model, and a global model, as well as two components: adaptive soft label construction utilizing dot product and intra-subject self-supervised learning employing cosine similarity, to reduce computational complexity and intra-class variation. Additionally, we introduce regularization loss to prevent bias in personalized models in heterogeneous data situations. We assume an actual authentication environment in which tens of thousands of clients participate in federated learning and evaluate personalizing performance using DigiFace-1M <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Bae et al.(2023)Bae, de La Gorce, Baltrušaitis, Hewitt, Chen, Valentin, Cipolla, and Shen</a>]</cite> and VGGface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cao et al.(2018)Cao, Shen, Xie, Parkhi, and Zisserman</a>]</cite> benchmark data.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Face Recognition.</span> Face recognition has seen a remarkable enhancement in performance through the utilization of large-scale data, identities, and models, sparking considerable interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang and Deng(2021)</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Boutros et al.(2022a)Boutros, Huber, Siebke, Rieber, and Damer</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kwak et al.(2023)Kwak, Jung, Yoo, Shin, and Kim</a>]</cite>. However, state-of-the-art models require a lot of resources, so the execution environment is often limited to servers with no resource limitations. In this case, personal information is violated because the actual authentication process requires facial data to be transmitted from the client to the server. In contrast to large-scale models, there is a growing body of research focusing on lightweight models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Alansari et al.(2023)Alansari, Hay, Javed, Shoufan, Zweiri, and Werghi</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Boutros et al.(2022b)Boutros, Siebke, Klemt, Damer, Kirchbuchner, and Kuijper</a>]</cite>. MobileFaceNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2018)Chen, Liu, Gao, and Han</a>]</cite> exemplifies one such lightweight face recognition model, boasting speeds that are more than twice as fast as MobileNetV2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sandler et al.(2018)Sandler, Howard, Zhu, Zhmoginov, and Chen</a>]</cite>. However, enhancing the performance of pre-trained models like these, which utilize public data, proves challenging due to constraints imposed by model size and the inability to conduct additional training using user data. FedFS aims to address this limitation by enhancing recognition performance through personalized facial feature training while safeguarding personal information.


<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning.</span> Federated learning is attracting attention as a way to protect personal information. FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahan et al.(2017)McMahan, Moore, Ramage, Hampson, and y Arcas</a>]</cite> is a method of creating a global model by calculating the average of the parameters of a local model trained using data from each client. Recently, research on personalized federated learning, which improves personalized performance by utilizing models customized to suit individual goals, is increasing. However, most research has only been conducted on small-scale datasets such as MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">LeCun et al.(1998)LeCun, Bottou, Bengio, and Haffner</a>]</cite> and CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">Krizhevsky et al.(2009)Krizhevsky, Hinton, et al.</a>]</cite>. To solve these problems, research on face recognition has been conducted in federated learning environments such as FedFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Aggarwal et al.(2021)Aggarwal, Zhou, and Jain</a>]</cite> and FedFR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al.(2022)Liu, Wang, Chien, and Lai</a>]</cite>. FedFR simultaneously trained for generalizing performance and personalizing performance using public data. In contrast, we do not use public data directly, because utilizing the data requires the client’s resources, which can be very taxing on the client’s devices.


<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contrastive Learning.</span> Contrastive learning researchs achieve state-of-the-art results on learning image features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2020a)Chen, Kornblith, Norouzi, and Hinton</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2020b)Chen, Kornblith, Swersky, Norouzi, and Hinton</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">He et al.(2020)He, Fan, Wu, Xie, and Girshick</a>]</cite>. The main idea of contrastive learning is to diminish the distance between the features of the same identity of the images and increase the distance between the features of different identities of images. In the past, dot products were widely used in contrastive learning, but recently, cosine similarity has been widely used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Deng et al.(2019)Deng, Guo, Xue, and Zafeiriou</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.(2018)Wang, Wang, Zhou, Ji, Gong, Zhou, Li, and Liu</a>]</cite>. This shift is attributed to the potential of dot products to yield large values based on the data, resulting in various issues such as inflated weight values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Thongtan and Phienthrakul(2019)</a>]</cite>. However, geometrically speaking, cosine similarity solely concerns angular, rendering normalized data indistinguishable in magnitude. This means that cosine similarity is effective in maximizing inter-class variation, but shows poor performance in some cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Steck et al.(2024)Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus</a>]</cite>. In contrast, the dot product is influenced not only by the angle but also by the magnitude, enabling differentiation even among data involving the same identifier. From this perspective, we aim to minimize intra-class variation by using dot product and cosine similarity simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive learning is garnering significant attention due to its outstanding performance, and numerous studies applying federated learning and contrastive learning are underway. Unlike traditional contrastive learning approaches, in federated contrastive learning, clients can only have their data, so there are no other identities. To address this challenge, a variety of federated learning-based studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al.(2022)Liu, Wang, Chien, and Lai</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kim et al.(2023)Kim, Kwak, Jung, Shin, Kim, and Kim</a>]</cite> are attracting much attention. In this paper, we focus on effectively learning individual features (positive data) without other identities (negative data) in a federated learning setup and propose regularization loss to prevent overfitting and bias.</p>

In intra-subject self-supervised learning, two major operations are performed simultaneously. 1) Training local information and reducing intra-class variation with intra-subject loss. 2) Preventing overfitting and bias with regularization loss. Considering the client’s restriction to utilize only local data for privacy protection, each client trains the model using only positive data, excluding negative data. Under these conditions, the client <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="c" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">c</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑐</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">c</annotation></semantics></math> performs operations with the global model, personalized model, and pre-trained model on input data <math id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x_{c,i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml">x</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">c</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.3.2">𝑥</ci><list id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.2c">x_{c,i}</annotation></semantics></math> and obtains the following results, respectively:</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct experiments to analyze how much performance is improved compared to the pre-trained model using FedFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Aggarwal et al.(2021)Aggarwal, Zhou, and Jain</a>]</cite>, FedFR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al.(2022)Liu, Wang, Chien, and Lai</a>]</cite>, and our proposed method, FedFS. We use four pre-trained models: MobileFaceNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2018)Chen, Liu, Gao, and Han</a>]</cite>, PocketNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Boutros et al.(2022b)Boutros, Siebke, Klemt, Damer, Kirchbuchner, and Kuijper</a>]</cite>, GhostFaceNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Alansari et al.(2023)Alansari, Hay, Javed, Shoufan, Zweiri, and Werghi</a>]</cite>, and MobileNetV2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sandler et al.(2018)Sandler, Howard, Zhu, Zhmoginov, and Chen</a>]</cite>. The participation rate of all federated learning algorithms is 0.7, and we calculate AUROC and the percentage improvement based on the pre-trained model. These results are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setting ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, and the ROC Curve graph under the same conditions is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setting ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a result of Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setting ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Fugure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setting ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can see that most models show good performance compared to the pre-trained model, but FedFS has the best performance. Because pre-trained models are trained based on large amounts of public data, they are difficult to retrain, and collecting the user data causes privacy issues. Additionally, in the case of the FedFace and FedFR, the performance improvement is not high because they assume a small number of clients and a 1.0 participation rate rather than a large number of clients. On the other hand, our proposed FedFS effectively trains facial features and reduces intra-class variation through intra-subject self-supervised learning using only local data without violating personal information, and shows that significantly improves personalized face recognition performance.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed FedFS, a federated learning framework to train optimized facial features for each client by using intra-subject self-supervised learning while protecting personal information. Through intra-subject self-supervised learning, we could effectively learn a user’s facial features and reduce intra-class variation by simultaneously leveraging dot product and cosine similarities among personal data, resulting in improved recognition performance compared to previous federated learning methods. We believe that FedFS could be applied to various federated face recognition tasks.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Intra-subject self-supervised learning learning defined in the Equation 9, improves performance of personalized face recognition compared to previous approaches. We go further and check whether the proposed method reduces intra-class variation and analyze how the method affects performance. We set the participation rate at 0.7, and use PocketNet [5] as the pre-trained model. As shown in Figure <a href="#A2.F1" title="Figure B.1 ‣ Appendix B Ablation Studies ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a> and Table <a href="#A2.T1" title="Table B.1 ‣ Appendix B Ablation Studies ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a>, we can see that the intra-subject self-supervised learning method considering correlation shows superior performance compared to using the general entropy learning method and regularize loss has a significant impact on performance by preventing overfitting and bias. In particular, as shown in the figure <a href="#A2.F1" title="Figure B.1 ‣ Appendix B Ablation Studies ‣ Federated Learning for Face Recognition via Intra-subject Self-supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a>, the proposed method has the smallest intersection of the positive similarity area and the negative similarity area. Through these results, we confirm that intra-subject self-supervised learning reduces intra-class variance.</p>
