<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Existing traffic flow forecasting approaches by deep learning models achieve excellent success based on a large volume of datasets gathered by governments and organizations. However, these datasets may contain lots of user’s private data, which is challenging the current prediction approaches as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. Therefore, how to develop accurate traffic prediction while preserving privacy is a significant problem to be solved, and there is a trade-off between these two objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce a privacy-preserving machine learning technique named federated learning and propose a Federated Learning-based Gated Recurrent Unit neural network algorithm (FedGRU) for traffic flow prediction. FedGRU differs from current centralized learning methods and updates universal learning models through a secure parameter aggregation mechanism rather than directly sharing raw data among organizations. In the secure parameter aggregation mechanism, we adopt a Federated Averaging algorithm to reduce the communication overhead during the model parameter transmission process. Furthermore, we design a Joint Announcement Protocol to improve the scalability of FedGRU. We also propose an ensemble clustering-based scheme for traffic flow prediction by grouping the organizations into clusters before applying FedGRU algorithm. Through extensive case studies on a real-world dataset, it is shown that FedGRU’s prediction accuracy is 90.96% higher than the advanced deep learning models, which confirm that FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely traffic prediction without compromising the privacy and security of raw data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contemporary urban residents, taxi drivers, business sectors, and government agencies have a strong need of accurate and timely traffic flow information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as these road users can utilize such information to alleviate traffic congestion, control traffic light appropriately, and improve the efficiency of traffic operations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Traffic flow information can also be used by people to develop better travelling plans. Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) is to provide such traffic flow information by using historical traffic flow data to predict future traffic flow. TFP is regarded as a critical element for the successful deployment of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) subsystems, particularly the advanced traveler information, online car-hailing, and traffic management systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In TFP, centralized machine learning methods are typically utilized to predict traffic flow by training with sufficient sensor data, e.g., from mobile phones, cameras, radars, etc. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and their variants have achieved gratifying results in predicting traffic flow in the literature. Such learning methods typically collaboratively require sharing data among public agencies and private companies. Indeed, in recent years, the general public witnessed partnerships among public agencies and mobile service providers such as DiDi Chuxing, Uber, and Hellobike. These partnerships extend the capability and services of companies that provide real-time traffic flow forecasting, traffic management, car sharing, and personal travel applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, it is often overlooked that the data may contain sensitive private information, which leads to potential privacy leakage. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction: A Federated Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, there are some privacy issues in the traffic flow prediction context. For example, road surveillance cameras capture vehicle license plate information when monitoring traffic flow, which may leak user private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> When different organizations use data collected by sensors to predict traffic flow, the collected data is stored in different clouds and should not be exchanged for privacy preservation. These make it challenging to train an effective model with this valuable data. While the assumption is widely made in the literature, the acquisition of massive user data is not possible in real applications respecting privacy. Furthermore, Tesla Motors leaked the vehicle’s location information when using the vehicle’s GPS data to achieve traffic prediction, which would cause many security risks to the owner of the vehicle<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/197750" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/197750</a></span></span></span>.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the data privacy leakage issue, we incorporate a privacy-preserving machine learning technique named Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for TFP in this work. In FL, distributed organizations cooperatively train a globally shared model through their local data without exchanging the raw data. To accurately predict traffic flow, we propose an enhanced federated learning algorithm with a Gated Recurrent Unit neural network (FedGRU) in this paper, where GRU is an advanced time series prediction model that can be used to predict traffic flow. Through FL and its aggregation mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, FedGRU aggregates model parameters from different geographically located organizations to build a global deep learning model under privacy well-preserved conditions. Furthermore, contributed by the outstanding data regression capability of GRU neural networks, FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely traffic flow prediction for different organizations.

Since then, many researchers have proposed variants of ARIMA such as Kohonen-ARIMA (KARIMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, subset ARIMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, seasonal ARIMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, etc. These models further improve the accuracy of TFP by focusing on the statistical correlation of the data.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional centralized learning methods consist of three steps: data processing, data fusion, and model building. In the traditional centralized learning context, data processing means that data feature and data label need to be extracted from the original data (e.g. text, images, and application data) before performing the data fusion operation. Specifically, data processing includes sample sampling, outlier removal, feature normalization processing, and feature combination. For the data fusion step, traditional learning models directly share data among all parties to obtain a global database for training. Such a centralized learning approach faces the challenge of new data privacy laws and regulations as organizations may disclose privacy and violate laws such as GDPR when sharing data. FL is introduced into this context to address the above challenges. However, existing FL frameworks typically employ simple machine learning models such as XGBoost and decision trees rather than complicated deep learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Because such models need to upload a large number of parameters to the cloud in FL framework, it leads to expensive communication overhead which can cause training failures for a single model or a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Therefore, FL framework needs to develop a new parameter aggregation mechanism for deep learning models to reduce communication overhead.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present two approaches to predict traffic flow, including FedGRU and clustering-based FedGRU algorithms. Specifically, we describe an improved Federated Averaging (FedAVG) algorithm with a Joint-Announcement protocol in the aggregation mechanism to reduce the communication overhead. This approach is useful to implement in the following particular scenarios.</p>

To address these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving traffic flow prediction algorithm FedGRU as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction Algorithm ‣ IV METHODOLOGY ‣ Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction: A Federated Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Firstly, we introduce FedAVG algorithm as the core of the secure parameter aggregation mechanism to collect gradient information from different organizations. Secondly, we design an improved FedAVG algorithm with a Joint-Announcement protocol in the aggregation mechanism. This protocol uses random sub-sampling for participating organizations to reduce the communication overhead of the algorithm, which is particularly suitable for larger-scale and distribution prediction. Finally, we give the details of FedGRU, which is a prediction algorithm combining FedAVG and Joint-Announcement protocol.</p>

To reduce the communication overhead, each client uses its local data to perform gradient descent optimization on the current model. Then the central cloud performs a weighted average aggregation of the model updates uploaded by the clients.

In this case, since there are only 8 participants, we can define it as a small-scale federated learning model. However, a large number of participants may join FedGRU for traffic flow forecasting. When FedGRU is expanded to a large-scale scenario with many participants, FedAVG algorithm is hard to converge because of expensive communication overhead, thereby the accuracy of FedGRU will decrease. To address this issue, we design an improved FedAVG algorithm with a Joint-Announcement protocol in the aggregation mechanism to randomly select a certain proportion of organizations from a large number of participants in the <math id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math>-th round training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.9" class="ltx_p">Since the organizations select FL tasks based on its location information in the federated traffic flow prediction learning problem, for the same FL task, better spatio-temporal correlation of the data, leads to better performance. Based on the above hypothesis, we propose the ensemble clustering-based FedGRU algorithm to obtain better prediction accuracy and handle scenarios in which a large number of clients jointly work on training a traffic flow prediction problem by grouping organizations into <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> clusters before implementing FedGRU. Then it integrates the global model of each cluster center by using an ensemble learning scheme, thereby obtains the best accuracy. In this scheme, the clustering decision is determined by using the latitude and longitude information of the organizations. We use the constrained K-Means algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. According to the definition of the constrained K-Means clustering algorithm, our goal is to determine the cluster center that minimizes the Sum of Squared Error (SSE).

<p id="S5.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, the proposed FedGRU and clustering-based FedGRU algorithms are applied to the real-world data collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> database for performance demonstration. The traffic flow data in PeMS database was collected from over 39,000 individual detectors in real time. These sensors span the freeway system across all major metropolitan areas of the State of California <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In this paper, traffic flow data collected during the first three months of 2013 is used for experiments. We select the traffic flow data in the first two months as the training dataset and the third month as the testing dataset. Furthermore, since the traffic flow data is time-series data, we need to use them at the previous time interval, i.e., <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{x_{t-1}},{x_{t-2}},\cdots,{x_{t-r}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.4a"><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.4.cmml"><msub id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow></msub><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.4" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.2.cmml">x</mi><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow></msub><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.5" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">⋯</mi><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.6" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.2.cmml">x</mi><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.1.cmml">−</mo><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.3.cmml">r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.4b"><list id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.4.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3"><minus id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.1"></minus><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.2">𝑥</ci><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3"><minus id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.1"></minus><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.3.3.2.2.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">⋯</ci><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.2">𝑥</ci><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3"><minus id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.1"></minus><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.3.3.3">𝑟</ci></apply></apply></list></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.4c">{x_{t-1}},{x_{t-2}},\cdots,{x_{t-r}}</annotation></semantics></math>, to predict the traffic flow at time interval <math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, where <math id="S5.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="r" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">r</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑟</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1c">r</annotation></semantics></math> is the length of the history data window.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compared the performance of the proposed FedGRU model with that of GRU, SAE, LSTM, and support vector machine (SVM) with an identical simulation configuration. Among these five competing methods, FedGRU is a federated machine learning model, and the rest are centralized ones. Among them, GRU is a widely-adopted baseline model that has good performance for traffic flow forecast tasks, as aforementioned in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV METHODOLOGY ‣ Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction: A Federated Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, and SVM is a popular machine learning model for general prediction applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In all investigations, we use the same PeMS dataset. The prediction results are given in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-A FedGRU Model Architecture ‣ V EXPERIMENTS ‣ Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction: A Federated Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> for 5-min ahead traffic flow prediction. From the simulation results, it can be observed that MAE of FedGRU is lower than those of SAEs, LSTM, and SVM but higher than that of GRU. Specifically, MAE of FedGRU is 9.04% lower than that of the worst case (i.e., SVM) in this experiment. This result is contributed by the fact that FedGRU inherits the advantages of GRU’s outstanding performance in prediction tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B Traffic Flow Prediction Accuracy ‣ V EXPERIMENTS ‣ Privacy-preserving Traffic Flow Prediction: A Federated Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows a comparison between GRU and FedGRU for a 5-min traffic flow prediction task. We can find that the predict results of FedGRU model are very close to that of GRU. This is because the core technique of FedGRU to prediction is GRU structure, so the performance of FedGRU is comparable to GRU model. Furthermore, FedGRU can protect data privacy by keeping the training dataset locally.

From the results, the loss of FedGRU model is not significantly different from GRU model. This proves that FedGRU model has good convergence and stability. In a word, FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely traffic flow prediction without compromising privacy.</p>

The reason is that more clients introduce increasing communication overhead to the underlying communication infrastructure, which makes it more difficult for the cloud to simultaneously perform aggregation of gradient information. Furthermore, such overhead may cause communication failures in some clients, causing clients to fail to upload gradient information, thereby reducing the accuracy of the global model.</p>

Nevertheless, FedAVG is significant for reducing communication overhead because the number of entities involved in predicting traffic flow tasks in real life is usually small. Therefore, we need to propose a new communication protocol for large-scale organizations to solve the problem of communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a FedGRU algorithm for traffic flow prediction with federated learning for privacy preservation. FedGRU does not directly access distributed organizational data but instead employs secure parameter aggregation mechanism to train a global model in a distributed manner. It aggregates the gradient information uploaded by all locally trained models in the cloud to construct the global one for traffic flow forecast. We evaluate the performance of FedGRU on a PeMS dataset and compared it with GRU, LSTM, SAE, and SVM, which all potentially compromise user privacy during the forecast. The results show that the proposed method performs comparably to the competing methods with minuscule accuracy degradation with privacy well-preserved.
Furthermore, we apply an ensemble clustering-based FedGRU for TFP to further improve the model performance. We also demonstrate by empirical studies that the proposed joint-announcement protocol is efficient in reducing the communication overhead for FedGRU by 64.10% compared with centralized models.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, this is among the pioneering work for traffic flow forecasts with federated deep learning. In the future, we plan to apply Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> to the federated learning framework to better capture the spatial-temporal dependency among traffic flow data to further improve the prediction accuracy.</p>
