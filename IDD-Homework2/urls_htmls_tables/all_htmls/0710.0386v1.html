<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present an analytical tool for understanding
the performance of structured overlay networks under churn based on
the master-equation approach of physics. We motivate and derive
an equation for the average number of hops taken by lookups
during churn, for the Chord network.
We analyse this equation in detail to understand
the behaviour with and without churn. We then use this
understanding to predict how lookups will scale for
varying peer population as well as varying the sizes of the
routing tables. We then consider a change in the maintenance
algorithm of the overlay, from periodic stabilisation to
a reactive one which corrects fingers only when a
change is detected. We generalise our
earlier analysis to understand how the reactive strategy compares with
the periodic one.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A crucial part of assessing the performance of a structured P2P system (aka DHT) is
evaluating how it copes with churn. Extensive simulation is currently the prevalent tool for
gaining such knowledge. Examples include the work of Li <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>,

There has also been some theoretical analyses done, albeit less frequently. For instance, Liben-Nowell <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> prove a lower bound on the
maintenance rate required for a network to remain connected
in the face of a given churn rate. Aspnes <span id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> give upper and lower
bounds on the number of messages needed to locate a node/data item
in a DHT in the presence of node or link failures.
The value of theoretical studies of this nature is that they provide
insights neutral to the details of any particular DHT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We have chosen to adopt a slightly different approach to theoretical
work on DHTs. We concentrate not on establishing bounds, but rather on
a more precise prediction of the relevant quantities in such
dynamically evolving systems. Our approach is based mainly on the Master-Equation approach used in the
analysis of physical systems. We have previously introduced our approach in
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> where we presented
a detailed analysis of the Chord system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
In this paper, we show that the approach is applicable to other systems as well.
We do this by comparing the periodic stabilization maintenance technique
of Chord with the
correction-on-change maintenance technique of DKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

reviewing some of
our previously published results on predicting the performance of the Chord network
as a function of the failed pointers in the system in the case that the nodes
use a periodic maintenance scheme. We then show some new results on how this complicated
equation can be simplified to get quick predictions for varying number
of peers and varying number of links per node. We relegate some of the details of
this analysis to Appendix <a href="#S7" title="VII Appendix ‣ Comparing Maintenance Strategies for Overlays This work is funded by the 6th FP EVERGROW project." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a complicated system like a P2P network, in which
there are many participants,
and in which there are many inter-leaved processes happening in time,
predicting the state of the network (or of any quantity of interest) can
at best be done by specifying the
probability distribution function (PDF) of the
quantity in the steady state (when the system, though changing
continually in time, is stationary on average).
For example, one quantity of interest for us when analysing such a network, is the fraction of failed links between nodes, in the steady state.
This quantity does not take
some deterministic value in the steady state. Instead it is specified by a PDF,
which can then be used to determine the average value.
The problem is thus to calculate the PDF (and then to understand how it
affects the performance of the network, as explained below).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In general this is not
an easy task, since the probability is affected by a number of inter-leaved
processes in any time-varying system. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, we demonstrated
how we could analyse a P2P network like Chord
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, using a Master-Equation based approach. This approach
is generally used in physics to understand a system evolving in time,
by means of equations specifying the time-evolution of the probabilities of finding the
system in a specific state. These equations require as an input,
the rates of various processes affecting the state of the system. For example,
in a peer-to-peer network, these processes could be the join and failure rates
of the member nodes, the rate at which each node performs maintenance as well as
the rate at which lookups are done in the network
(the latter rate is relevant only if the lookups affect the state of the
network in some way). Given these rates, the equation for the time-evolution
of the probability of the quantity of interest can be written by
keeping track of how these rates affect this quantity (such as the number
of failed pointers in the system) in an infinitesimal interval of time,
when only a limited number of processes (typically one) can be expected to
occur simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With this approach, we
were able to quantify very accurately the probabilities of any connection in the network
(either fingers or successors) having failed. We then
demonstrated how we could use this information
to predict the performance of the network—the number of hops <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">including</span> time outs
which a lookup takes on average — as a function of the rates
(of join, failure and stabilization) of all the processes happening in the network, as
well as of all the parameters specifying the network (such as
how many pointers a node has on average). The analysis was done for a specific
maintenance strategy, called periodic maintenance (or eager maintenance)</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we generalise our approach so as to be able to compare networks
using different maintenance strategies. In particular, we compare our earlier results
for periodic maintenance with a reactive maintenance strategy proposed in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Combining this with some of our previous results, we are
also, as a by product, able to compare the performance of networks specified by
different numbers of peers, different number of pointers per node and/or
different maintenance strategies. As we show below, which system is better
depends both on the value of the parameters as well as the level of churn.
The approach we propose is thus a useful tool for the quantitative and fair
comparison of networks specified by different parameters and using different algorithms.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, an analysis, very similar in spirit to the one done in this paper, is carried out in
the context of P-Grid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. An equation is written for system performance in the
state of dynamic equilibrium for various maintenance strategies. However for each maintenance strategy,
the analysis has to be entirely redone. In contrast, a master equation description
provides a foundation for the theoretical analysis of overlays,
which does not have to be entirely rebuilt each time any given algorithm is changed.
As we show in this paper, we can carry over a lot of our earlier analysis, when the maintenance scheme
is changed from a periodic to a reactive one. In addition, the master equation description
can be made arbitrarily precise to include non-linear effects as well. And as we show, non linear effects
are important when churn is high.</p>

The advantage of writing the lookup length this
way is that churn-specific details such as how new
joinees construct a finger table
or how exactly
stabilizations are done in the system, can be isolated
in the expression for <math id="S4.p14.10.m10.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p14.10.m10.1a"><mi id="S4.p14.10.m10.1.1" xref="S4.p14.10.m10.1.1.cmml">f</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p14.10.m10.1b"><ci id="S4.p14.10.m10.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p14.10.m10.1.1">𝑓</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p14.10.m10.1c">f</annotation></semantics></math>.
If we were to change our stabilization strategy, as we will

<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this section, we analyse a different maintenance strategy
using the master-equation formalism. The strategy we have analysed
so far is periodic stabilisation of successors as well as fingers.
We now consider a strategy where a node periodically stabilises its
successors but does not do so for its fingers. Instead, for maintaining
its fingers, it relies on other nodes for updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

(failed or incorrect), it sends out messages to all the nodes
that are pointing
to its wrong first successor, so that they can update
their affected finger. The node sending messages can either do so
by broadcasting these messages to all affected nodes simultaneously, or by
scheduling messages periodically at some rate. We analyse the latter option
in this paper, since it provides a more intuitive and broader framework for
the comparison of the two schemes</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we have demonstrated the usefulness of the
master-equation approach for understanding churn in overlay networks.
Our analysis can take into account most details of the
algorithms used by these networks, to provide predictions for
how the performance depends on the parameters.
There are several directions in which we can extend the present analysis.
One of the more important ones is to model congestion on the links.
This could affect the performance of the two compared
maintenance strategies differently. The periodic case
may not be as affected as much as the reactive case, which could suffer from
congestion collapse.</p>
