<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In Machine Learning scenarios, privacy is a crucial concern when models have to be trained with private data coming from users of a service, such as a recommender system, a location-based mobile service, a mobile phone text messaging service providing next word prediction, or a face image classification system.
The main issue is that, often, data are collected, transferred, and processed by third parties. These transactions violate new regulations, such as GDPR. Furthermore, users usually are not willing to share private data such as their visited locations, the text messages they wrote, or the photo they took with a third party.
On the other hand, users appreciate services that work based on their behaviors and preferences.
In order to address these issues, Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed as a means to build ML models based on private datasets distributed over a large number of clients, while preventing data leakage.
A federation of users is asked to train a same global model on their private data, while a central coordinating server receives locally computed updates by clients and aggregate them to obtain a better global model, without the need to use clients’ actual data.
In this work, we extend the FL approach by pushing forward the state-of-the-art approaches in the aggregation step of FL, which we deem crucial for building a high-quality global model. Specifically, we propose an approach that takes into account a suite of <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-specific criteria</span> that constitute the basis for assigning a score to each client based on a priority of criteria defined by the service provider.
Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets indicate the merits of the proposed approach compared to standard FL baseline.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The vast amount of data generated by billions of mobile and online IoT devices worldwide holds the promise of significantly improving usability and user experience in intelligent applications. Such large-scale quantity of rich data has created an opportunity to dramatically advance the intelligence of machine learning models by catering powerful deep neural network models. Despite this opportunity, we know that such pervasive devices can capture much data about the user, such as what she does, what she sees, and even where she goes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, where most of these data contain sensitive that a user may deem private.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To respond to concerns about the sensitivity of user data in terms of data privacy and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, in recent years initiatives have been made by governments to prioritize and improve the security and confidentiality of user data. For instance, in 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enforced by the European Union to protect individuals’ privacy and data security. These issues and regulations pose a new challenge to traditional AI models where one party is involved in collecting, processing, and transferring all data to other parties. It is easy to foresee the risks and responsibilities involved in storing/processing such sensitive data in the traditional <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized</span> AI fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an approach recently proposed by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to train a global machine learning model from a massive amount of data, which is <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed</span> on the client devices such as personal mobile phones and IoT devices. It is noteworthy that FL differs from traditional distributed learning since we assume that training data — which is supposed to be sensitive — is maintained on the users’ devices they were generated on (e.g., data generated from users’ interaction with mobile applications, such as geographical data in location-aware applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>).
Therefore, we have to deal with data that is quantitatively unbalanced and differently distributed over devices, i.e., each device data is not a representative sample of the overall distribution. Instead, in a traditional distributed setting, data has to be collected in a centralized location and then evenly spread over proprietary computing nodes. As a matter of fact, with FL, we leverage users’ computing power for training a shared ML model while preserving privacy, by actually decoupling the ability to learn a ML model from the need to store private data centrally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In principle, a FL model is able to deal with fundamental issues related to privacy, ownership and locality of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, authors introduced the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</span> (FedAvg) algorithm, which combines local stochastic gradient descent on each client via a central server that performs model aggregation by averaging the values of local parameters. To ensure that the developments made in FL scenarios uphold to real-world assumptions, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> the authors introduced LEAF, a modular benchmarking framework supplying developers/researchers with an abundant number of resources including open-source federated datasets, an evaluation framework, and several reference implementations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its potentially disruptive contribution, we argue that FedAvg has several significant shortcomings. First, the aggregation operation in FedAvg assigns the contribution of each agent proportional to each client’s local dataset size. This simplifying assumption ignores a wealth of other qualitative measures that can be impactful for training an effective global model. Examples of such measures include the number of sample classes held by each agent, the divergence of each computed local model from the global model — which may be critical for convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> —, estimations about the agent computing and connection capabilities and finally the amount of client’s honesty and trustworthiness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While FedAvg only uses limited knowledge about local data, we argue that the integration of the aforementioned qualitative measures and the expert’s domain knowledge is fundamental for increasing the global model’s quality.
As a toy example, let us consider a federated scenario with just two users Alice and Bob. The photos in users’ mobile phones are the training samples of a ML model for classifying clothes. Let us suppose that Alice holds tens of very similar photos with the same outfit, and most of them are blurred. Thus these images do not carry much information. Instead, Bob holds a smaller number of well-labeled photos, but high-quality, and with a lot of different clothes. We argue that in such a situation, the weight of Bob’s contribution to the ML model should be higher or comparable to Alice’s.</p>

Nonetheless, FL also extended towards cross-silo architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, for multiple organizations willing to train a model in inherently sensitive domains (e.g., financial or medical). For example in healthcare, regulations prohibit medical institutions from sharing medical data (e.g., to improve medical imaging performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>); however, FL makes centralization unnecessary, by allowing data to remain isolated in the individual organizations while still improving medical AI models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The approach we propose is configured as a formal tool for incorporating any of the above-mentioned objectives (for example, facing the statistical challenges), when these could be obtained by pushing up or down the contribution of each client, based on some requirements. Such mechanism is completely incorporated in the weight of each client in the global aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work attempting to modify the value of the weight of clients in the aggregation step.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) have been proposed by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> as a privacy-preserving architecture for training a ML model, by using private data from a large set of users who will never share them with other parties in the system.
The motivation behind FL is mainly efficiency and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Indeed, since users’ data never leaves the devices, FL models can be trained on private and sensitive data, e.g., the history of user typed messages, which can be considerably different from publicly accessible datasets.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, a federated setting has to face some key issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> related to communication, connectivity and statistics.
Among them, if we focus on the statistical aspects about the data, we notice that training data — which is typically the result of the real user usage of the device — represent a non-IID distribution of the training data over the large number of clients. Moreover, the amount of data is also unbalanced across the clients.
Such characteristic may affect the accuracy and the efficiency of the resulting aggregated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
In this scenario, a service provider may be interested in defining some statistical criteria such that the rounds of communication needed to reach the desired target accuracy are minimized. This result can be accomplished by enhancing the contribution of clients fulfilling the requirements expressed by the defined criteria.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, useful information could be related, in a classification problem, to the number of classes covered by a local dataset.
Moreover, a domain expert could ask users to measure their adherence to some other target properties (e.g. their nationality, gender, age, job, behavioral characteristics, etc.), in order to build a global model emphasizing the contribution of some classes of users; in this way, the domain expert may, in principle, build a model favoring some targeted commercial purposes.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Although we can identify some classes of criteria, the choice for each particular criterion still remain a strictly task- and domain-dependent activity. We provide some insights about how to define such criteria: first, as a rule of thumb, one should start from the objective, e.g., obtaining faster convergence, overshadow unreliable updates, specialize the model with respect to some categories of users and then choose characteristics which can improve the model towards that initial objective. Next, the system designer could play with the identified criteria to test their effectiveness, e.g. with some previous centralized data, or with some synthetic data, or with some validation rounds of federated training. Finally, the empirical evaluations performed in this work suggest that choosing criteria that lead to higher variance in the score obtained across clients results in a better final model. For instance, the criterion dataset size is not an appropriate criterion, if all the clients have the similar number of samples in their private datasets.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p4.2" class="ltx_p">With respect to the third criterion, our aim is to reduce the negative effects of a non-IID distribution. Indeed, with non-IID distributions — and this is the case of our dataset — model performance dramatically gets worse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Moreover, a large number of local training epochs may lead each device to move further away from the initial global model, towards the opposite of the global objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, a possible solution inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is to limit these negative effects, by penalizing higher divergences and highlighting local models that are not very far from the received global model.

Each image comes with 40 binary attributes and differs from the other ones for celebrity pose and background. The task is a binary classification between smiling and non-smiling people, which is an information included within the 40 attributes. We chose this task since the smiling attribute has a good balance in the whole dataset between positive and negative outcomes.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We use this dataset in a completely user-aware way. Indeed, we suppose that each celebrity holds her own photos in her mobile phone gallery. This represent a realistic set of local datasets, which could have been generated from the personal device usage. This distribution is inherently Non-IID, therefore it is a representative scenario for a federated setting.</p>

For what concerns the parameters of stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we used full batch approach and we set the number of local epochs equal to 5, i.e., each client takes 5 epochs of gradient descent during training. Moreover, we chose the learning rate based on a grid search by looking for the value which makes it possible to first reach the target accuracy in 50% of devices with the baseline approach (dataset size as the only criterion). Finally, we set the maximum number of rounds of communication per each experiment to 1000 for MNIST and to 100 for CelebA.</p>

In detail, as target accuracies, we have considered 70%, 80%, 90%, and 95% of prediction accuracy for MNIST datasets, and 70%, 80%, and 85% for CelebA dataset.
The remaining rows of the tables show the gain in terms of rounds of communication of each experimental setting against the baseline.
Therefore, we compute each row as the difference between the results of the dataset size criterion model, and the results of the corresponding model. The higher the positive value, the better is the approach compared to the baseline. Moreover, for each row and target accuracy, we show the average rounds of communication gained by considering all the fractions of devices.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To have a comprehensive view of the effects of each criterion and their combinations, we consider the individual criteria and their combinations separately.
Specifically, we first show the results of the experiments realized by exploiting a single criterion (i.e., in Eq. <a href="#S4.E6" title="In 4.3 Identification of a score function ‣ 4 Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning ‣ Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).

The adoption of criteria that are different from the dataset size seems to have no effects, but some insignificant fluctuations.
We expected this behavior since the dataset does not show statistical issues.
In detail, the local datasets have been created by randomly picking samples from the original dataset.
Consequently, we may represent the divergence of the local models from the original model as a zero-mean Gaussian noise.
The same assumption holds for the label diversity.
Furthermore, by the design of the dataset, DS is equal for every client, and we also expect that, on average, LD is the same for all clients.
As a consequence, MW can not play a significant role, since all clients train the model with the same distribution of data, on average.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In detail, by looking at the differences between the two criteria LD and MW against the baseline DS, we may notice that the gain in terms of rounds of communication for 70%, 80%, and 90% target accuracy, considering all the percentages of clients, has an average very close to 0.
Conversely, both LD and MW show slightly worse results than DS for a target accuracy of 95%, notably when we want to grant such accuracy to a very high number of devices (i.e., the last three columns of Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, the experiment shows that the effectiveness of criteria depends on the data distribution.
The dataset shows how datasets built by randomly picking data from the original distribution do not generally need further statistical adjustments during the training phase.
Therefore, we do not need to consider, in our approach, any particular statistical-based criteria.
On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the scenario is completely unrealistic in a federated scenario.
Indeed, since each user privately generates data, they will not show the same distribution, and they will be significantly different in terms of statistical properties.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding DS, LD, and MW, Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows that DS is the best criterion to reach the best overall system performance in a lower number of rounds.
In detail, DS seems to be in trouble in the first rounds to achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy. In fact, if we look at 70% and 80% of the accuracy, LD and MW reach those goals faster. In this sense, we may notice an average of 1-2 rounds gained by LD and MW.
However, if we need a higher degree of accuracy (90% and 95%), DS generally reaches that accuracy from 5 to 12 rounds before, on average.
In this respect, we may notice that, without considering the last three columns of 95%, DS and LD show approximately the same performance, with an advantage of 0.5 rounds on average for LD. On the other hand, in the same scenario, MW is 3.6 rounds slower on average.
Nonetheless, the remaining three last columns show an average advantage of DS of 12 and 16 rounds for LD and MW, respectively.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Results in Table <a href="#S6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> show that the three criteria behave in a significantly different way.
In this experiment, we note that CB performs much better than DS.
To get an impression, we may notice CB reaches 85% of the overall accuracy for the 60% of the devices in less than half of the rounds of DS.
Moreover, if we observe the CB row in Table <a href="#S6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Prioritized Multi-Criteria Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we may note that it reaches the same accuracy goals of DS much faster. In detail, CB reaches those goals 7.5 rounds before DS.
On the other side, IS is generally slower than DS. Indeed, it generally needs 7.6 rounds more than DS.
Another interesting insight is that the advantage of CB over DS progressively increases. In detail, CB shows an advantage of 8.6 rounds for the 70% of accuracy, 11.5 rounds for 80%, and 13 rounds for an accuracy of 85%.</p>

Analogously to the individual criteria, we observe that the average gain is quite close to 0, for each target accuracy.
The section 95% is an exception, since its last three columns show a slowdown up to 9 rounds of communication, on average.
This behavior is probably due to the adverse effects we already observed for the individual criteria in this dataset.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The analysis in the previous section already shows the fundamental role of the identification of local criteria.
By considering the underlying dataset, the different criteria heavily affect the training phase outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an example, when we create a federated dataset by randomly picking samples from an original dataset (i.e., with an IID distribution), the adoption of statistical criteria is not beneficial, since data, on local devices, shows the same expectation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, even in MNIST Non-IID distributed dataset, it is quite disappointing that we can not appreciate the benefits of introducing new criteria like label diversity.
However, if we observe the dataset deeper, it contains local shards of the same size, and each client processes, at most, samples of two digits that make the number of classes in local datasets a piece of useless information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Instead, the criterion on model divergence gives an initial boost to training, but it seems to have adverse effects for higher target values of accuracy.
Even here, the behavior is interesting and predictable.
Indeed, the penalization of significant divergences is the right choice because it helps to build a robust estimator on the average of the samples.
However, at the end of the training, higher precision and fine training could require those differences.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As expected, when we observe the most realistic dataset, CelebA, we may appreciate more the effects of the proposed approach.
In fact, it is a realistic Non-IID distribution of images where each client holds samples which are different in number and number of classes.
Consequently, the attribute about class balancing gives the best results either when considered individually and also combined with the dataset size attribute.
This is probably due to the differences both in dataset size and class balancing among the local datasets.
Conversely, Sharpness is a theoretically useful attribute, but it results in a slowdown of performance during the training phase.
We believe that the reason for this behavior is twofold.
First, only a few images are marked as blurry in the dataset.
Second, a right combination of sharp and blurry images has widely proven to be beneficial for the generalization of a CNN.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7 </span>Conclusions and Future Perspectives</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have introduced a practical Federated Learning (FL) protocol that exploits non-sensitive client information to aggregate the local models.
In detail, we have formalized the notion of a local criterion for clients in an FL scenario, and the notion of priority ranked criteria.
By considering the ranking of the criteria, we have defined the score functions to weigh the contribution of a client.
We have tested our approach on three well known federated learning datasets: IID-distributed MNIST, Non-IID-distributed MNIST, and CelebA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The experiments show that we can substantially improve the standard federated learning approach by exploiting a properly defined set of local criteria.
The approach is particularly effective when dealing with Non-IID distributions of data.
This is remarkable since a real federated scenario will show a Non-IID distribution of data, rather than an IID distribution, where differences among clients are not so perceptible. In general, substantial differences among devices about a property make the corresponding criterion more effective.
In practical terms, we have improved the federated approach by enhancing the individual differences, respecting the true federated learning spirit. In the experiments, for each dataset, we have investigated three different criteria that consider local datasets and local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, there is still a broad spectrum of criteria that deserves to be explored.
On the other hand, from the experiments, it also emerges that a criterion’s efficacy highly depends on the specific dataset/domain.
Even though several considerations may lead the researcher, it is not possible to find a unique criterion that meets the needs of all the possible domains.
Nevertheless, the study of the individual criteria has revealed some information about their impact on the training phase, which we hope may be useful for other researchers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we have observed how some criteria may be useful in some moments of the training, but they also may cause issues in others.
In this respect, we propose a self-adaptive model that re-ranks the priority of criteria as partially investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
We are particularly interested in this research direction and in the chance of leveraging this federated approach to other machine learning scenarios, like Recommender Systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and Deep Learning.
Indeed, in those research fields, local model specialization and privacy are crucial, and this prioritized federated learning approach may be particularly beneficial.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, currently the focus of our work has been to protect privacy of users and provide satisfactory predictions. In doing this, as our proposed system relies on a number of local criteria obtained from users, using such criteria may lead to some unfair or biased recommendation toward particular class of users (e.g., men v.s. women) or particular class of items (paid v.s. non-paid jobs). The reason is we do not control over how to use these features to protect user fairness and algorithmic biases. We deem this an important open research direction for which we plan to employ fairness-aware metrics as part of our approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>
