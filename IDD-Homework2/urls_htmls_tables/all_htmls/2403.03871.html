<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is an emergent distributed machine learning paradigm wherein owners of disjoint features of a common set of entities collaborate to learn a global model without sharing data. In VFL, a host client owns data labels for each entity and learns a final representation based on intermediate local representations from all guest clients. Therefore, the host is a single point of failure and label feedback can be used by malicious guest clients to infer private features. Requiring all participants to remain active and trustworthy throughout the entire training process is generally impractical and altogether infeasible outside of controlled environments. We propose Decoupled VFL (DVFL), a blockwise learning approach to VFL. By training each model on its own objective, DVFL allows for decentralized aggregation and isolation between feature learning and label supervision. With these properties, DVFL is fault tolerant and secure. We implement DVFL to train split neural networks and show that model performance is comparable to VFL on a variety of classification datasets.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, or FL, was introduced by Google researchers as a strategy for distributed learning, addressing communication efficiency and data privacy. Distributed participants in FL training do not expose their data to any other party. Instead, they train local models on their data, guided by a coordinator that has no knowledge of the agents’ data. Thus, FL extends collaborative machine learning to contexts where data communication is undesirable or forbidden. Recent advances in communication systems and cloud computing infrastructure combined with an increased public awareness and legislation regarding data privacy (such as the EU’s GDPR) have contributed to FL’s advancement as an emergent machine learning paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Among FL’s developments is Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). Standard FL can be said to have a “horizontal” or “sample-parallel” division of data, i.e. each participant holds unique samples within a shared feature space. On the other hand, VFL participants hold unique features of a common sample space, which is a “vertical” division, and is “feature-parallel”. This allows guest agents who individually have incomplete information about their target to learn meaningful joint representations without sharing data. A typical example: an imaging center, pathology lab and general hospital may come together to predict rare types of cancer, even though health regulations such as HIPAA may disallow them from collecting each others’ data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">VFL guest agents undertake an “entity alignment” phase before training, where they ensure their datasets’ horizontal indexing is identical, i.e., all participants process features belonging to the same entity in any round of training. At each round, each guest passes its features to its local “guest model.” Guests share their local representations with a host. For example, a guest training a vertically federated ANN may send its activations. A boosted decision tree guest may send a weak learner. The host owns data labels and is aware of the identity of the sample or batch that the guests are processing at any time. The host also possesses a “host model” capable of aggregating these representations and making predictions against the labels. The host calculates a loss based on its aggregation and provides feedback (e.g. gradients) to the guests, which then begin the next round of training. We refer to the combined system of guest and host models as <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">VFL models</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">VFL has found increasing success in recent years, with various real-world implementations and proposals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. However, VFL suffers from some flaws which make its implementation impractical where participants are few in number and each computationally powerful (as in cross-silo scenarios), and entirely infeasible otherwise. One such flaw is that the link between the guests and the host is a single point of failure. Training a batch of data is contingent on the exchange of intermediate results between the guests and the host. If the host waits indefinitely for all guests to communicate, a guest crashing or losing connection would completely halt training. If the host sets a deadline, some inputs to its model will remain unfulfilled. (In the latter case, a late message will also cause a catastrophic fault). If gradients from the host to the guests are lost or arrive in the incorrect order, guest model convergence is hampered. One might dismiss such events as infrequent or at least controllable in cross-silo settings. However, that is naive. When some of the guests (and even the host) could be geographically sparse and/or low-power devices, it is catastrophic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A fundamental limitation of VFL is imposed by the size of the joint sample space. For instance, databases in groups of large nationwide financial institutions may share many but not all customers. Guests must discard data outside the intersection, which could have been used to learn better guest models. In systems where the intersection is small, there may not be enough samples to train a VFL model altogether.
In general, this also hinders VFL’s applicability to systems with large-scale participation. Consider again the hospital example. Suppose the task is now to predict bone marrow cancer. Along with the pathology lab, the imaging center and the general hospital, we also include data collected by an orthopaedic hospital. Even if the overlap of patients at the other facilities is significant, <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_slanted">their</span> overlap with patients of the orthopaedic hospital may be too small.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another drawback of VFL (and FL in general) is the risk of inference attacks from curious guests. Intuitively, a host makes predictions based on information it receives from all guests. The updates or feedback it returns is derived from this prediction and the ground truth. Therefore, feedback sent to one guest contains some mutual information with respect to the others and to the label. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Luo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Fu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> show that a malicious agent can engineer its messages to the host such that the label and the other guests’ features can be conveniently extracted from the gradients it receives in return. Attempts to safeguard VFL against inference attacks are generally based on differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party techniques such as audits and shared secrets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>); Khan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. These operations incur a high computational cost, which might not be feasible outside some cross-silo scenarios. Further, these methods hamper model convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Building intricate mechanisms to mitigate these issues inflates the complexity of the problem. In this work, we attack the source directly. Backpropagating gradients to guests allows inference attacks. The wait for a response or feedback causes synchronization issues. What if we eschewed end-to-end backpropagation (BP) altogether? We present Decoupled Vertical Federated Learning (DVFL), a novel strategy for ANNs to address these shortcomings. The underlying principle is blockwise learning, where gradient-isolated groups of layers of an ANN are trained on local objectives. Such greedily trained ANNs have been shown to perform comparably to those trained by BP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Belilovsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Journé et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. We decouple guest models from host models by training them on their own <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span> objectives. Similarly, we decouple supervision from aggregation by training host models on local objectives. We use a final transfer learning model to make predictions against labels. This yields two useful system properties. One, this allows redundant hosts. Standard VFL would require hosts to share labels with each other, which is forbidden. Two, we may use separate datasets for feature extraction and label inference.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">With redundancy, even if a guest’s connection to one host fails, training may continue as normal on others. If hosts may fail, the redundancy also affords some degree of tolerance. By using separate datasets for inference and representation learning, we may train guest and host models on data which is not necessarily labeled and not necessarily a part of a joint sample space. This makes DVFL applicable to systems with small intersections of sample spaces. Further, the label owner’s supervised model can be trained completely offline, without the risk of faults.</p>

The authors also show that after VFL training is complete, it is possible for a curious guest to train its own prediction model if it can gain access to a very small number of labels. If a malicious guest inflates its learning rate during training, the aggregator gives more importance to results from its model. This way, a prediction model trained only on the features of the malicious guest is almost identical to the aggregator model itself. A malicious guest equipped with such a prediction head can make accurate guesses for labels without accessing other guests’ features.</p>

In order for a layer to evaluate an input to begin with, a forward pass must propagate to it (forward locking).

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the DVFL hierarchy, ANNs are natural choices for participants’ models. Unsupervised neural networks are feature extractors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Intrator (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>); Becker &amp; Plumbley (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>, which is precisely the role of guest and host models. Similarly, the strong task performance of ANNs have been the primary driver of deep learning over the past few years, so they are suitable for owners, too. Indeed, just as SplitNN is a popular implementation of VFL, we expect ANNs to be common models for DVFL participants.</p>

<p id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DVFL is an alternate strategy to VFL. Naturally we compare DVFL for ANNs to SplitNN, a direct application of VFL to ANNs. Naive VFL implicitly employs the “wait” protocol discussed in Sec <a href="#S2.SS4.SSS1" title="2.4.1 Single Points of Failure ‣ 2.4 Impracticalities in VFL Training ‣ 2 Background: Standard VFL" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4.1</span></a>. There are some simple additions to SplitNN that would allow a more meaningful comparison. Firstly, if the host sets a deadline, we may continue training despite missing inputs by skipping (we call this <em id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">SplitNN-skip</em>) or by supplying replacement values. For replacement values, we try a zero tensor (<em id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">SplitNN-zeros</em>). Hosts may ask guests to send the identities of the entity to which each of their messages belong. This way, a late message cannot be believed to be intended for the next iteration.

SplitNN, the baseline VFL algorithm, cannot train at all when there are any faults. On the other hand, our DVFL implementation degrades gracefully with faults. Using an explicit fault handling strategy within VFL does allow it to train. But the degradation with faults is sharper than DVFL and the variance in model performance is higher. Under fault-free circumstances, SplitNN slightly outperforms our DVFL implementation. With minor adjustments, SplitNN can tolerate some faults, but our approach is more resilient and stable.</figcaption>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We observe (Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experiments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) that model performance degrades with faults, but not catastrophically (unlike VFL with SplitNN). In ideal conditions, DVFL performance is slightly poorer than SplitNN. This is not unexpected, since our models are shallow. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> show performance improves with the length of backpropagation in blockwise-trained networks, and suggest it is due to increasing mutual information between shallower and deeper layers. Further, given a model, the reconstruction loss guides the feature extractor to features that will be useful for reconstruction– not necessarily good for classification. It is expected that the gap between DVFL and SplitNN will reduce with more general loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">van den Oord et al. (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>); Caron et al.

Further, observe that the degradation with faults in DVFL is much more graceful than our SplitNN variants. Not only does the SplitNN-wait/skip/stale performance drop more sharply, the variance increases more than it does with DVFL.</p>

loss it is 97.03 and 97.02% respectively. The performance of the combined model depends on unique outputs from guests– there is no redundancy. With a host or communication fault, guests are still able to update their own models (and there might be redundant hosts, too). In the case of SplitNN-skip and SplitNN-host, a communication fault is just as bad– a guest cannot send forward passes to (or receive backward passes from) the single host whether it or the connection is down. A host fault is equivalent to skipping that round for training.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we only examine loss faults. Other typical failure modes for distributed systems include arbitrary delays, incorrect order, and Byzantine faults. For the forward pass, the first two might be mitigated within VFL itself. Since hosts request encoded features from a particular sample or batch of samples, they may ask guests to send back the identity of those samples along with the features (as we assumed in the variants of SplitNN. While the privacy is dubious, there is precedent in VFL: see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sun et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>); Jiang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. But, in order to correctly serialize, the host must maintain a cache of unused messages. For the backwad pass, if a guest has sent two outputs before receiving a single gradient, it has no way of knowing which output it corresponds to. DVFL is immune to these issues, since guests and hosts train independently to each other.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present Decoupled Vertical Federated Learning, a strategy for joint learning on vertically partitioned data. Instead of adding complexity to cope with the data leakage and synchronization associated with BP, we eschew feedback altogether. Combined with the ability to reuse feedforward signals, this allows for fault tolerance and privacy in training. Training may continue even when there are faults, or there are a limited number of samples common to all guests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DVFL also provides a high degree of privacy. Malicious or compromised guests can no longer use gradient feedback to figure out possibly sensitive information. Existing techniques to enforce privacy guarantees either hamper model convergence, are expensive to implement or both.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our results suggest its performance to be comparable to SplitNN on various machine learning tasks. Unlike SplitNN, DVFL degrades gracefully with various kinds of loss faults. Even with explicit fault handling strategies, SplitNN’s performance drops off more sharply than DVFL’s. In general, DVFL’s asynchronicity provides a great deal of engineering flexibility. Some of it is discussed in the Appendix.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The next step for DVFL is to generalize it for more tasks and general architectures. VFL is readily compatible with a variety of machine learning models (including ensemble models). With a judicious choice of training objective for guest models, DVFL may also be extended past ANNs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another possible direction for DVFL is the introduction of more elaborate fault handling strategies. In this work, the aggregating “host” uses the the latest activation received from a “guest” client. This allows for a simple implementation using single-reader single-writer registers. We observe that this leads to meaningful representation learning– empirically, we only observe a 0.26% drop in accuracy on MNIST even when there is a 30% crash fault rate. In a bid to close this gap further, hosts might build a model of the distribution of its inputs. Hosts could then sample missing inputs from its posterior conditioned on successful messages. A natural first step would be to use a running mean as an estimator.</p>

<p id="A3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we present DVFL, an alternate strategy to VFL. We demonstrate its prowess through a DVFL implementation for ANNs. Since DVFL is altogether a new strategy to train on vertically partitioned data, it makes sense to benchmark it against the current status quo for VFL with ANNs, which is SplitNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gupta &amp; Raskar (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Ceballos et al.

<p id="A3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In its base form, the SplitNN algorithm does not have any explicit fault handling strategy. Implicitly (assuming that the coordination between hosts and guests is interrupt-driven), the hosts use the “wait” strategy. Training stops completely if inputs are missing. We also consider strategies using “timeout”. Timeout allows training to continue, although hampered. We handle timeouts by skipping or replacing the values. If a message appears after the deadline, it needs to be discarded lest it appear as if it were intended for the next iteration. This artificial baseline represents a best-case fault-tolerance for vanilla VFL. This way, it gets a fair shot against DVFL. Indeed, since DVFL suffers from some information loss (since feedback is very limited), VFL equipped with these strategies may still outperform DVFL at low fault rates.</p>

<p id="A3.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under “wait”, training can be made to restart if the failed participant comes back online by busy-waiting viz. the repeatedly polling a failed guest. If the guests send sample IDs along with their features (and hosts cache messages until they are used), they may figure out which iteration a particular message is intended for. This way, no information is lost. However, until that failed participant is back online, training is held up. This is also a poor strategy from a systems perspective, since it wastes bandwidth and computational resources, especially when there is a message authentication in place. If a guest is laggy and the host polls it many times before it repsonds, the cache of messages the host must store will be very large. Neither in this case nor the timeout case is there a well-defined strategy to handle backward-pass faults.</p>

<p id="A3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DVFL addresses various VFL issues such as fault tolerance, privacy and sample size with one fell swoop. There are various mechanisms built upon standard VFL algorithms (including SplitNN) which aim to address some or the other of these issues. FedVS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> is a work that addresses multiple, i.e. fault tolerance and privacy. FedVS might be a reasonable benchmark for DVFL, and we have presented some results against its paper in Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Results on More Datasets, Comparison to FedVS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>. DVFL outperforms FedVS in perfect conditions. In the main paper, we showed that DVFL performance does not degrade much with faults with our generalized fault model. On the other hand, FedVS performance is completely fault tolerant, except under a much more stringent fault model. Beyond this, FedVS constrains guest models to use a specific type of model– polynomial networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Livni et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014a</a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite>. Moreover, FedVS only deals with faults during the forward pass. FedVS considers a restricted fault model: upto a fixed number of guests can be late to/fail to communicate their activations with the hosts. These are also true for most of its predecessors e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Shi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. DVFL does not require any such system parameter, and is tolerant to a broader class of faults where any participant can fail at any time, including during backpropagation.</p>

<p id="A4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A host reads its model inputs from its activation replay buffer. Thanks to this, it can train asynchronously to the guests. The host can train independently to the guests as long as the guests have communicated at some prior point of time. In fact, that is the case in our experiments– we simulate host models’ training offline, after guest training. As discussed in Appendix <a href="#A4.SS1" title="D.1 Periodic Communication ‣ Appendix D Communication and Space Complexity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D.1</span></a>, this allows control over when the guests communicate.</p>
</div>
<div id="A4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another way to look at this is: hosts do not need to train for the same number of iterations as guests communicate messages for. This includes the case where guests communicate every iteration, but hosts want to train more (or less) iterations. As we detailed in Appendix <a href="#A2.SS3" title="B.3 Other Hyperparameters ‣ Appendix B Models, Hyperparameters and Implementation Details" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.3</span></a>, we actually implement this for our experiments. While we use 40 epochs to train the entire SplitNN model, we only use 20 epochs to train the DVFL guests. Guests need not remain online for any more time than required to train 20 epochs. So, not only does this allow for more flexibility, it also helps fault tolerance.</p>

Further, these expensive memory read/write operations also add time complexity to DVFL hosts’ training. This overhead does not exist in standard VFL.

For example, consider our experiments with MSE as the guest and host objectives. Along with our model, we need to train a decoder head that projects the guest output onto a space of the same dimension as input. Modern contrastive self-supervised losses e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>); Zbontar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> typically use a shallow projector network from the desired representation onto a latent space. The loss is calculated using the projected vectors. Intuitively, in the absence of a pre-computed ground truth label, the model must perform extra computation to generate the “self-”supervisory signals.</span></span></span>, although it can be mitigated to some extent since some models can be trained for fewer epochs as discussed above.
