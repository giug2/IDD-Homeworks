<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper tackles the problem of ensuring training data privacy in a federated learning context. Relying on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Differential Privacy (DP), we propose a framework addressing threats on the privacy of the training data. Notably, the proposed framework ensures the privacy of the training data from all actors of the learning process, namely the data owners and the aggregating server. More precisely, while HE blinds a semi-honest server during the learning protocol, DP protects the data from semi-honest clients participating in the training process as well as end-users with black-box or white-box access to the trained model.
In order to achieve this, we provide new theoretical and practical results to allow these techniques to be rigorously combined. In particular, by means of a novel stochastic quantisation operator, we prove DP guarantees in a context where the noise is quantised and bounded due to the use of HE.
The paper is concluded by experiments which show the practicality of the entire framework in terms of both model quality (impacted by DP) and computational overhead (impacted by HE).</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning techniques have become ubiquitous in almost all fields of industry and our daily lives. The used algorithms, and especially neural networks, the most popular ones in many applications, require massive amounts of data to get trained and reach the impressive accuracy that made their success. This huge need for data together with the omnipresence of the Internet and the boom of communication exchanges made data the ”new oil” (Clive Humby, 2006).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel, confidentiality has raised greater and greater concerns as evidenced by the new regulations on data privacy (e.g. GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> in the EU) and, while all kinds of data might be considered as private, some fields, like healthcare (e.g. HIPAA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in the USA) or military applications, are especially sensitive to privacy breaches.
In this context, it is well known that, once trained, a machine learning model may indirectly release some information about its training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Many researchers have exhibited attacks on these models, assuming that the adversary has access to the parameters of the model (white-box access) or even only to the output of the inference on some queries she made to the model (black-box access) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These attacks are even more likely with the emergence of machine learning as a service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> in the recent years.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with these issues, the most popular approach to data privacy is differential privacy (DP), introduced by Dwork et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which quantifies the amount of information leaked by the output of a mechanism about its input. This notion of privacy implies that the considered mechanism is probabilistic, which is generally achieved by applying carefully parameterised random noise to a deterministic mechanism. Since 2006, DP has been widely used in machine learning applications (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Cryptography is another field that helps providing protection to sensitive data, in particular at training time. Specifically, homomorphic encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> or multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> allow to perform secure, blind computations without access to the inputs, and, in the case of HE, the outputs either. Additionally, HE can in some cases be associated to tools such as verifiable computing to bring additional computation integrity guarantees, including in the context of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In 2016, McMahan et al. proposed a new paradigm of collaborative learning that they called federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Along with the reduction of communication load and the parallelism it allows, a claimed key advantage is the protection of data due to the fact that each client keeps its own data locally. However, although FL gives some protection to the data with regard to the server, it gives rise to a new type of potential adversaries - the other clients. Several attacks that take advantage of this new threat were proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The contribution of this paper is the design of a privacy-preserving FL framework consistently combining countermeasures of different natures and aims, namely DP and HE. The above-mentioned attacks on the training data are addressed via DP, either they come from participants during the training or from the end-users of the model. Another potential threat comes from the server. To hide the data from it, the clients send encrypted information to the server which will do the necessary computations in the encrypted domain, without seeing either the sent information or the result of its computations, thanks to the homomorphic properties of the cryptosystem.
In order to consistently articulate DP and HE we introduce a new stochastic quantisation operator based on Poisson distribution. This operator behaves as it was applied as post-processing of a Gaussian mechanism, keeping the DP guarantees of this standard mechanism unchanged without any supplementary analysis and allowing to seamlessly get rid of the quantisation issue due to the use of HE.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">An interesting application scenario concerns the medical field. We may consider several hospitals that own medical data from their patients and wish to collaborate in order to train a global model that would detect a certain disease. In many countries, patient data are sensitive and the hospitals do not want to share them with other hospitals. A solution is to use an aggregation server (e.g. from an institutional entity) but the hospitals do not want to give it their data either.
Note that the parameters we used for our experiments on FEMNIST (see Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experimental results ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) make our cross-silo solution scales at a level which can be for example compatible with the number of medical facilities in a reasonably large country.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the additional threats from the other clients, DP has been quite popular in collaborative and especially FL frameworks.
For instance, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> trained a next word prediction algorithm in a federated way, using text data from users’ smartphones, protected by DP. Nevertheless, this work is hardly comparable to ours because the task for which the model is trained is very different from our targeted classification tasks (e.g. FEMNIST in our experiments), inducing very different learning parameters and thus a quite different privacy challenge.
Closer to our work is the one from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> which presents a differentially private FL process tested on MNIST, yet a notably easier task than FEMNIST.
Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> also experimented a differentially private distributed learning setting - similar to a FL setting due to the use of distributed stochastic gradient descent - on MNIST, and SVHN, another famous image dataset.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, Sabater et al. ensures privacy and utility of their distributed learning setting as long as each participant communicates with only a logarithmic number of other participants.
Abadi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> introduced the moments accountant method, a useful tool for our DP analysis, that enables to keep track of the privacy cost more tightly than the traditional composition theorem when many calls to the database are done, typically for training a deep neural network.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the works applying HE to machine learning models focus on the inference stage (CryptoNets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, TAPAS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, NED <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>) and not on the training stage.
The first papers on privacy-preserving machine learning training focused on a centralised setting where all data are outsourced and where the models are only linear <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. When it comes to non-linear models, the few approaches that ran a complete centralised training of neural networks on encrypted data have impractical performances or huge cryptographic parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While some authors propose solutions in the case of multi-servers either for clustering or regression, many methods employing HE have been recently proposed for a collaborative learning task with no central server. They mostly apply on linear models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and, more recently, Sav et al. focused on neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
As far as FL is concerned, only a few recent papers propose the use of HE to protect the clients’ data from the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> being only theoretical.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">More general than HE, multi-party computation protocols like secure aggregation allow several agents to collaborate and compute a function on their data such that each agent knows no more than its own input and, if requested, the output, and learns nothing about the other agents’ inputs. The combination of the high-communication costs of the multi-party computation and the inherent distributed nature of FL makes FL methods secured by multi-party computation (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) difficult to implement efficiently. Among these approaches, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> interestingly makes use of DP techniques to further protect the private data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A great focus and key contribution of our paper deals with the interference between our two defensive tools, namely DP and HE. The main issue induced by this interference is that the range of the messages to be encrypted (which are the noised updates in our work) has to be discrete and bounded (and representable with as few bits as possible).
For potentially other reasons than a necessary encryption of the data, some authors have studied the possibility of making a machine learning mechanism differentially private with a discrete noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> propose a secure and communication-efficient distributed learning framework and perform the DP analysis of their learning mechanism using a binomial noise because the effect of quantisation on the Gaussian mechanism is unclear, especially after aggregation if the noise is generated in a distributed way. The analysis is quite involved and only provides DP bounds for the multidimensional binomial mechanism for one round of learning. Indeed, the moments accountant method is not easily applicable to the binomial distribution. Moreover, the presented DP guarantee is worse than the Gaussian mechanism’s one and needs the quantisation scale to tend to zero (and the communication cost to infinity) to approach it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Koskela et al. present a privacy accountant for discrete-valued mechanisms for non-adaptive queries using privacy loss distribution formalism and Fast Fourier Transform. In particular, they give DP guarantees for the binomial mechanism in one dimension and extend them in the multidimensional case but with quite demanding constraints that compel them to brutally approximate the gradients by their sign in their experiments.
Cannone et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduce the discrete Gaussian mechanism and studied its DP guarantees that scale well with composition, even in the multivariate case. Nevertheless, contrary to binomial noise, discrete Gaussian noise is not bounded as required for our framework. Besides, the discrete Gaussian distribution is not stable by addition, thus precluding its direct use in a context of distributively generated noise that a collaborative learning task with untrusted server requires (see Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Distributed noise generation ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>).</p>

These works respectively use the discrete Gaussian mechanism and the Skellam mechanism to ensure DP. At the cost of a careful DP analysis, they show that, for fine enough quantisation scale, their DP guarantees approach the Gaussian mechanism’s one. Our work proposes a much simpler way to obtain the very same guarantee as the Gaussian mechanism, without needing to constrain the quantisation scale and with much simpler mathematical analysis. Moreover, the two previous works have to make use of conditional randomized rounding to ensure that the rounding of the unnoised values does not increase their norm too much. Since we perform quantisation after noising with a quantisation that can be viewed (from the DP perspective) as a post-processing (see Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Poisson quantisation ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>), we do not have such an issue.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a decentralised framework that enables multiple agents, called <em id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em>, to collaboratively train a shared global model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping the training data localised on the client devices thus helping to protect the data privacy and reducing communication costs. After a common (server-side) arbitrary initialisation of the global model, the FL process consists of successive rounds of communication between the server and the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.5" class="ltx_p">The most common approach to optimisation for FL is the Federated Averaging algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. At the beginning of each round, the server selects a subset of clients to take part in training for this round, we call these particular clients the <em id="S3.SS1.p2.5.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">participants</em>. The server sends the current global model to the participants and each of them trains the model locally with several epochs of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using its own data. The participants then communicate only the updated parameters or the updates<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Difference between the updated parameters and the old ones.</span></span></span> back to the server. In our work, the participants send the updates because their norm is easier to constrain (necessary for privacy reasons). Finally, the server computes the weighted average of these updates before accumulating them into the global model, thereby concluding the round. The weight associated to a participant in the average is generally the fraction of training samples owned by the participant.

The adversaries that we consider are all the actors of the learning process, namely the clients and the server, and all the entities having access to the model once training is over, namely the end-users (that may include the clients themselves). The clients are assumed to be honest-but-curious, which means that they properly perform their task but may use the information they get to retrieve sensitive information about the training data. The end-users are also assumed to be semi-honest, although they do not necessarily participate to the training protocol. The server is also assumed to be mostly honest-but-curious and, as such, it is assumed to perform the correct required computations. However, as a slight bonus beyond this assumption, the server is not trusted to generate the noise needed for DP in order to prevent the threat whereby that noise is shared with a client or an end-user. As explained in the end of Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="4.5 DP analysis of the Gaussian mechanism ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a>, by easily adapting the DP guarantee, the same misbehaviour can also be taken into account for the clients that may collude and share their noises.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When one wants to protect the training data by DP in a collaborative learning process, the assumption of the honest-but-curious server might be mitigated and the server may not be trusted to generate the noise, because it may communicate it to clients or end-users, thus annihilating the DP guarantees.
A common practice in that case is to make the participants generate the noise in a distributed way <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
This is especially practical when one wants the resulting noise to follow a Gaussian distribution, since this distribution is stable by addition. The participants simply need to generate Gaussian noise with well-chosen variance.
However, DP in a FL context still requires adaptations of the FL process:</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our scenario, the information sent by the participants to the server is encrypted via HE. Since floating-point homomorphic calculations (although in principle possible) are prohibitively costly, we have to switch to a fixed-point representation while avoiding using too many bits (as the cost of FHE calculations will decrease, due to several factors discussed in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experimental results ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, with the number of bits required to represent the plaintexts). This means that, unlike the usual case where the noise is represented by a double-precision float (i.e. finite but very fine precision) and where we make the assumption that it perfectly follows the desired distribution, we here have to explicitly take into account bounds on the noise and quantisation of this noise (and of the updates themselves).
However, if we round the noised updates in a traditional way (scaling and rounding to the nearest integer), the aggregated noise is not Gaussian any more, but it is a sum of noises that follow rounded Gaussian distributions. Unfortunately, the distribution of a sum of rounded Gaussian variables does not have a simple expression (in particular, it is not a rounded Gaussian distribution)<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>If such a distribution would be easily dealt with, the issue of boundedness could be addressed by considering the modulo operation induced by encryption, like in <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Dealing with unboundedness ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>.</span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A naive approach would be to try to compare the complicated distribution of a sum of rounded Gaussians with the one of a sum of perfect Gaussians i.e. a Gaussian. Indeed, if the quantisation scale is fine enough, the sum of rounded Gaussians should intuitively be close to a Gaussian. The final privacy cost should be the sum of the one of a classical Gaussian mechanism and a hopefully small additional privacy cost due to the approximation. Nevertheless, this analysis is quite involved and may result in overestimated DP bounds.</p>

Since adding continuous Gaussian noises distributively on the updates and add them afterwards amounts to add a Gaussian noise to the sum of the unnoised updates, the Poisson quantisation acts as if it was applied on top of the Gaussian mechanism. <em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Hence, the huge advantage of our Poisson quantisation operator is that it allows to reduce the DP analysis back to the vanilla analysis of the Gaussian mechanism</em> (Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="4.5 DP analysis of the Gaussian mechanism ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a>).</p>

The noise introduced as a side-effect by Poisson quantisation may even improve the privacy but, for simplicity, we consider it as banal post-processing and do not take it into account in the DP analysis.
Hence, the DP analysis reduces to the Gaussian mechanism’s analysis.

Additionally, one key contribution of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> was to associate Paillier-based homomorphic calculations to Verifiable Computing (VC) techniques (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) to further extend the server threat model beyond the honest-but-curious one and bring execution integrity, as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> did with BFV scheme. However, these works lacked DP. Indeed, adding the DP noise on the server requires a tag that can only be generated with knowledge of the VC scheme secret key (i.e. by a client), meaning, in the Federated Learning context, that at least one of the clients would have knowledge of the noise added (resulting in a collapse of the DP guarantee for this client, even when that knowledge is uncertain). We could actually imagine that the server generates <math id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS6.p2.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> noises that sum to the required noise and send each of them to a participant for tag generation but this would double the communication cost. Hence, associating DP with VC for server-side computation integrity maintaining a reasonable communication cost requires a distributed noise generation as provided in this paper. As such, the noise generation technique provided in this work is directly applicable to setups where homomorphic calculations are paired with VC techniques.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we addressed the problem of collaborative learning where all the actors of the training stage - clients and server - and the end-users are potential honest-but-curious adversaries. We chose the popular FL framework and adapted it in two ways. Firstly, by having the clients add random noise on the information they send to the server, we made the learning mechanism differentially private from the point of view of any end-user of the model and that of the clients themselves. Secondly, following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, we added a HE layer on the server side so that the server cannot see the updates coming from the clients, that may release sensitive information about the training data.
The HE layer has a major impact on the random noise added to ensure DP, essentially because of the limited number of bits available for a reasonable computation time. However, we proved that this interference can be seamlessly dealt with in terms of privacy thanks to some adaptations among which a new carefully crafted quantisation operator.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We ran experiments on FEMNIST dataset that prove the practicality of our framework in terms of accuracy, privacy cost and computation time, thoroughly analysing the cost of DP in accuracy compared to an non-DP baseline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The present work could easily be extended to a setting whereby the assumption of the honest-but-curious server is relaxed, making the learning process robust to a server who would, willingly or not, make mistakes in its computations. As argued in Section <a href="#S4.SS6" title="4.6 Homomorphic encryption protects the data (and the model) against the server ‣ 4 Our privacy-preserving federated learning framework ‣ Protecting Data from all Parties: Combining Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.6</span></a>, this could be done using verifiable computing techniques, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, in a quite straightforward further work thanks to the fact that the server is not in charge of adding the random noise necessary to DP.</p>

<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.3" class="ltx_p">Testing our framework on a larger, more cross-device-oriented dataset would be quite interesting to estimate its scalability.

<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another quantisation function or a more involved analysis that would not need to lower bound the random noise added to the updates would allow us to get rid of the argument of the imperfect sampling algorithms and to use our framework with other noise distributions, not necessarily bounded, even in practice.</p>

The ziggurat algorithm applies to monotonically decreasing probability distributions and extends to symmetric unimodal distributions like the normal one by randomly choosing on which side of the mode the sampled value will fall. The algorithm works by covering the distribution by stacked rectangular regions of same area. What matters for our problem of finding the bound of the sampling process is only the tail rectangle. In the rare case where the value did not fall into one of the other rectangles, a fallback algorithm is used to sample the value from the tail.</p>

To get a sample from an arbitrary normal distribution, it suffices to scale the sample of the standard normal distribution by the wanted standard deviation and then add the wanted mean.
This discussion allows us to exhibit a lower bound for the Gaussian noises and, the unnoised updates being bounded by the clipping, for the noised updates. As a consequence we can apply Poisson quantisation.</p>
