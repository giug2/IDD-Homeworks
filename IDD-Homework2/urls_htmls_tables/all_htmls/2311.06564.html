<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p">Reactive injection attacks are a class of security threats in wireless networks wherein adversaries opportunistically inject spoofing packets in the frequency band of a client thereby forcing the base-station to deploy <em id="id17.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">impersonation-detection</em> methods. Towards circumventing such threats, we implement secret-key based physical-layer signalling methods at the clients which allow the base-stations to deploy machine learning (ML) models on their in-phase and quadrature samples at the baseband for attack detection. Using Adalm Pluto based software defined radios to implement the secret-key based signalling methods, we show that robust ML models can be designed at the base-stations. However, we also point out that, in practice, insufficient availability of training datasets at the base-stations can make these methods ineffective. Thus, we use a federated learning framework in the backhaul network, wherein a group of base-stations that need to protect their clients against reactive injection threats collaborate to refine their ML models by ensuring privacy on their datasets. Using a network of XBee devices to implement the backhaul network, experimental results on our federated learning setup shows significant enhancements in the detection accuracy, thus presenting wireless security as an excellent use-case for federated learning in 6G networks and beyond.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to the widespread use of wireless communication, it is crucial to secure next-generation of wireless networks from a wide range of active threats including malicious impersonations, injection attacks, etc on its wireless clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Although defenses in the form of software attestation, anomaly detection, trust-based and signature-based techniques can be implemented on their base-stations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, these mechanisms often come with limitations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, thus requiring new robust solutions. In the recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in pattern recognition, making them a strong toolset for distinguishing adversarial and non-adversarial entities in the wireless world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In such techniques, the underlying ML algorithms perform data-driven learning, wherein they identify and learn the relevant features from a given dataset of observations. Subsequently, the trained neural networks are deployed at the base-stations to distinguish adversarial and non-adversarial entities using their observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although base-stations are computationally capable of hosting ML techniques to detect impersonation attacks on their clients, they may not witness sufficient “labelled” datasets to train their neural networks. As a consequence, the ML based detection technique, when deployed at the base-station in the run-time, may not provide high-accuracy in their classification performance. One way to circumvent this problem is to involve a cloud-centric architecture, wherein the labelled datasets at each base-station are communicated to a cloud infrastructure, and an ML based neural network is trained at the cloud using the union of the datasets from all the base-stations. While this solution may enhance the detection accuracy, it accompanies the following concerns: (i) if the participating base-stations belong to different (or competing) service providers, they may not be willing to share the datasets of their clients due to privacy concerns, (ii) even if the participating base-stations belong to the same service provider, they may need to provide confidentiality feature on their datasets through crypto-primitives, which in-turn increases communication and complexity overheads, (iii) finally, when the ML model is implemented at the cloud, the observations that are under scrutiny for detection at each base-station, must be communicated to the cloud, thereby increasing the latency of detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to the drawbacks of a centralized architecture for ML models, it is appealing to retain the labelled datasets locally at each base-station, and still train their ML model in such a way that the accuracy benefits of that of the central architecture can be approached. One such decentralised strategy is the framework of Federated Learning (FL), wherein the participating base-stations collaborate to train a single model, by exchanging only their locally calculated updates with a centralized sever, thereby preserving privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. A popular FL implementation is federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which iteratively computes the local models at each base-station, and subsequently incorporates them into a global model via communication with a server. While FL seems to be an appealing choice to implement decentralized ML techniques, identifying strong use-cases in wireless networks and studying their implementation aspects are imperative. In this contribution, we present an interesting security use-case in wireless networks, wherein base-stations of different networks benefit from implementing FL based solution for detecting injection attacks on their clients. Explicit details on our contributions are provided in the next section.</p>

To detect these threats, we first present a secret-key based mitigation strategy at the victims (see Section <a href="#S2" title="II System Model ‣ Seeing is Believing: A Federated Learning Based Prototype to Detect Wireless Injection Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>), and then show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used at the base-stations to classify the received frames as adversarial or otherwise (see Section <a href="#S3" title="III Key-assisted CNN based Classifier ‣ Seeing is Believing: A Federated Learning Based Prototype to Detect Wireless Injection Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>). Once a CNN based detection is formalized at each base-station, we leverage on the benefits of FL by asking the base-stations to collaborate and refine their neural models. For the prototype demonstration of this use-case, we use Adalm Pluto based software defined radios (SDRs) at the clients and a combination of Adalm Pluto SDRs and XBee devices at the base-stations of individual networks. The interface is done in such way that each base-station uses SDRs in the fronthaul, whereas XBee devices are used in the backhaul communication to implement FL (see Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Attack Detection via Federated Learning ‣ Seeing is Believing: A Federated Learning Based Prototype to Detect Wireless Injection Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>). Experimental results from our prototype reveal that FL assists in significant improvements in the accuracy of the proposed detection method. Overall, this work is the first of its kind to demonstrate the benefits of FL in detecting injection attacks in wireless networks.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first present the single base-station based adversarial network by covering the signalling methods employed at the legitimate nodes and the adversary. Consider two legitimate nodes, Alice and Bob, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II System Model ‣ Seeing is Believing: A Federated Learning Based Prototype to Detect Wireless Injection Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, that play the roles of a client and a base-station (BS), respectively. We assume that Alice uses On-Off Keying (OOK) to convey her information bits to Bob. The reasons for opting OOK are two-fold: (i) to minimize pilot-transmission overhead from coherent communication and (ii) to avoid a potential pilot-contamination attack by an active adversary in the network. We also assume the presence of an adversarial node named Dave, that intends to execute an injection attack on the communication between Alice and Bob. In particular, Dave is equipped with a perfect full-duplex radio to eavesdrop on Alice’s transmitted bits. Furthermore, Dave has the capability to inject non-zero energy levels on Alice’s communication band whenever Alice communicates bit-0, and remain silent when bit-<math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math> is transmitted.

Henceforth, for the rest of the classification process, these figure files are the instances of the dataset used for training the CNN. After training, the goal of the CNN-based classifier is to identify whether Alice is the transmitter responsible for the received frame. Recall that the CNN model extracts relevant features and achieves accurate classifications through training on labeled datasets.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although a CNN based classifier can be implemented in the single base-station model, its detection accuracy is limited by the availability of the training datasets on both Alice’s and Dave’s samples. To further improve its accuracy, we apply FL under the framework of multiple base-stations, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Seeing is Believing: A Federated Learning Based Prototype to Detect Wireless Injection Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In this context, we assume that multiple base-stations across various geographical areas experience the same class of injection attacks on some of its clients. As a result, the proposed secret-key based mitigation strategy is already implemented at the clients of each base-station along with the corresponding CNN based detection at the base-stations. Furthermore, we assume that the base-stations are connected to a server-station which is responsible to execute the following tasks: (i) to receive the weights of the CNN from each base-station, (ii) to execute the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and (iii) to distribute the averaged weights back to the base-stations. In the rest of this section, we delve into FL’s practical implementation and present its performance improvement over the single-base-station framework.</p>

In our implementation, the server’s XBee acts as the coordinator while the base-station XBees serve as routers. The coordinator initializes and maintains the network, with routers communicating solely with the coordinator. Each base-station independently trains its CNN, with communication facilitated through XBee devices. Base-stations train local models on individual datasets, and the server aggregates updates through federated averaging in multiple communication rounds, ensuring continual model improvement. Finally, in the evaluation phase, we test the updated model at each base-station with the dataset specified in earlier sections.</p>

Similar to the case of two base-stations, in our setup, each round of FL consumed approximately 5 minutes due to low-bandwidth of XBee networks, along with the fact that each base-station communicated with the server-station in time-division multiple access manner to communicate their weights. While we understand that the presented orders of delay to execute FL are unacceptable in practice, using high-rate backhaul networks can speed-up this process in the order of few milliseconds in the real world setting.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have developed a prototype for detecting injection attacks in wireless networks. We have used Adalm Pluto based SDRs to implement a secret-key based communication strategy, which was designed to distinguish the legitimate node from an adversary through the scatter plots of the received I/Q samples. Our results demonstrate that an FL-based CNN classifier, when implemented at the base-station, can effectively detect injection attacks with high-accuracy.</p>
