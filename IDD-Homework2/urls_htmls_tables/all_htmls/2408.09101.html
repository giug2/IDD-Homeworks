<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. However, intensive memory footprint during the training process severely bottlenecks the deployment of FL on resource-limited mobile devices in real-world cases. Thus, a framework that can effectively reduce the memory footprint while guaranteeing training efficiency and model accuracy is crucial for FL.</p>
<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose SmartFreeze, a framework that effectively reduces the memory footprint by conducting the training in a progressive manner. Instead of updating the full model in each training round, SmartFreeze divides the shared model into blocks consisting of a specified number of layers. It first trains the front block with a well-designed output module, safely freezes it after convergence, and then triggers the training of the next one. This process iterates until the whole model has been successfully trained. In this way, the backward computation of the frozen blocks and the corresponding memory space for storing the intermediate outputs and gradients are effectively saved. Except for the progressive training framework, SmartFreeze consists of the following two core components: a pace controller and a participant selector. The pace controller is designed to effectively monitor the training progress of each block at runtime and safely freezes them after convergence while the participant selector selects the <em id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">right</em> devices to participate in the training for each block by jointly considering the memory capacity, the statistical and system heterogeneity. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SmartFreeze on both simulation and hardware testbeds. The results demonstrate that SmartFreeze effectively reduces average memory usage by up to 82%. Moreover, it simultaneously improves the model accuracy by up to 83.1% and accelerates the training process up to 2.02<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><times id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to train a shared model while preserving data privacy collaboratively. Despite the promising benefits, the intensive memory footprint within the training procedure is a critical obstacle preventing FL from being effectively deployed in real-world scenarios. To retrieve high-quality analysis, the recently developed deep learning models are becoming deeper and wider. Meanwhile, it necessitates a larger memory space to accommodate parameters, intermediate outputs, and gradients during the training process. For instance, training ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> on ImageNet with a batch size of 128 consumes over 26 GB of memory. Unfortunately, mainstream smartphones typically offer limited RAM, ranging from 4 to 16 GB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Thus, the training process cannot be well supported. On the other hand, simply training the small models that can fit the existing devices severely deteriorates the representation capability and limits the application scope of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitation of Prior Arts.</span> Memory optimization for model training has been widely studied in centralized learning. Techniques such as gradient checkpointing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, micro-batching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and host-device memory virtualization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have been widely utilized to reduce memory footprint on the server side. However, the existing techniques cannot be directly used in the setting of FL. For instance, host-device memory virtualization aims to expand the available memory budget using host-side memory. Nonetheless, the CPU and GPU share the same physical memory and compete for concurrent data access on mobile SoCs. Micro-batching breaks down the large batch but slows down the training efficiency at the same time. Model compression leads to prominent accuracy degradation. The accuracy loss aggravates in FL through model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several approaches have been developed to tackle the resource limitation in FL, which can be mainly divided into the following two categories: 1) model heterogeneous learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and 2) partial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. For model heterogeneous learning, models are customized based on the memory capacity of each client, and those models with different architectures are aggregated through knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches often require access to a public dataset for knowledge transfer, which is usually hard to obtain in real-world scenarios. Partial training assigns subsets of the global model with varying complexities to participating clients based on resource limitations. Nonetheless, these strategies severely compromise the model architecture and lead to a serious deterioration in model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Consequently, a framework that can effectively overcome memory limitations while balancing training efficiency and model accuracy in real-world FL scenarios is urgently required.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our Design.</span> The following key observation guides us to break the memory wall of heterogeneous FL from a new perspective. In FL, different layers of the shared model represent various convergence rates. The front layers stabilize much faster than the deep layers. This is for the reason that the front layers usually retrieve task-independent and relatively simple features while the latter layers capture the task-specific features. Thus, updating the full model during the whole training process leads to unnecessary computing resources. Progressively training the shared model can be promising. In this paper, we propose SmartFreeze, a framework that breaks the memory wall of FL from a new perspective. Unlike the vanilla FL that keeps updating the full model during the whole learning process, SmartFreeze conducts the training in a well-designed progressive manner. We can divide the model to be trained into blocks consisting of a specified number of layers corresponding to different stages, initiate the training with the front block, safely freeze it after convergence, and then iteratively trigger the training of the following blocks. In this way, the backpropagation process and the corresponding memory space for the intermediate activations and gradients can be effectively saved.</p>

However, simply using a fully connected layer as the output module can severely disrupt the feature representation the block should capture in the original model. To address this challenge, we utilize convolutional layers to replace the blocks following the block being trained, thereby preserving the position information of the block being trained, and assisting the block in learning the expected feature representation.</p>

<div id="S2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate the convergence rates across different layers in FL, we conduct the following experiment. First, a VGG16 is trained on the entire CIFAR10 dataset, and we use the converged model as a reference model. The CIFAR10 dataset is then evenly distributed to 100 clients in the form of both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) respectively. After that, we train another VGG16 model using FL, with 20 clients randomly selected in each training round.
The Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> between the activations of the shared model and the reference model is retrieved in each training round. Specifically, CKA quantifies the similarity between the representations of two layers and is computed by comparing the similarity of their respective outputs. A higher CKA signifies a stronger resemblance in feature extraction capabilities between the two layers.</p>

<div id="S2.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p10.2" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Motivation and Observation ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Memory Efficient Federated Learning via Progressive Layer Freezing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates the results of CKA for the first six convolutional layers. From Fig. <a href="#S2.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ II Motivation and Observation ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Memory Efficient Federated Learning via Progressive Layer Freezing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>, it can be observed that the CKA values of the six layers continuously increase as training proceeds, eventually stabilizing around the 1st, 15th, 35th, 40th, 45th, and 50th rounds respectively. Various layers have totally different convergence rates. The front layers quickly converge, while the later layers exhibit a slow convergence rate. This is for the reason that the front layers extract task-independent and simple features while the later layers capture task-specific and intricate features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Thus, updating all the layers from the beginning to the end of the training procedure can cause unnecessary computation overhead, providing an opportunity for layer freezing. This phenomenon is more pronounced under the Non-IID setting, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ II Motivation and Observation ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Memory Efficient Federated Learning via Progressive Layer Freezing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>. This is because the global data distribution, which means the distribution of total data involved in devices participating in each training round, is Non-IID, resulting in biases in both the direction and magnitude of parameter updates. Additionally, Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II Motivation and Observation ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Memory Efficient Federated Learning via Progressive Layer Freezing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> displays the CKA curves of the third and sixth convolutional layers at different degrees of Non-IID.

This is because as the degree of Non-IID increases, the degree of Non-IID of the global data distribution involved in each training round also increases.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The key challenge in progressive training is how to design the output module for each sub-model to be trained in each stage. Simply adding a fully connected layer as an output module would compromise the final model’s performance. This is because the block trained at that stage is encouraged to learn high-level features most beneficial for classification to reduce the training loss. Nevertheless, it is well-known that each block in a model has its inherent role, with earlier blocks primarily responsible for extracting low-level features. Consequently, this can severely disrupt the feature representation the block should capture in the original model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to maintain the role of each block as much as possible, we design the output modules for each block based on their specific position. Specifically, for the block currently being trained, each subsequent block is replaced with a convolution layer to emulate its position in the original model. For instance, when training ResNet-18’s first residual block (4 blocks in total), we append three convolutional layers and a fully connected layer as the output module behind it to preserve the first block’s position information. The intuition behind this strategy is to mimic the original model architecture through this construction method, thereby preventing functional disarray.</p>

If a parameter converges, its effective update will tend to approach zero. The rationale for this phenomenon lies in the fact that when a scalar converges, these recent updates tend to consistently approach zero, or the conflicts between updates intensify, leading to their mutual cancellation and ultimately resulting in a reduction of effective update <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. We define the sum of effective updates of all scalars within each block as the block perturbation to reflect the learning status of each block, which is defined as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Louvain algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is a type of community detection, but directly applying it results in too coarse-grained communities that cannot accurately capture the data differences among clients. Therefore, we design a robust Louvain community detection (RL-CD) algorithm in response to this challenge. RL-CD enhances community partitioning through iterative application of the Louvain algorithm, incorporating a weight distribution sharpening technique. During the partitioning process, we introduce the following criteria as conditions to halt the community division. <math id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Standard_{stop}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">S</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1b" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1c" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">d</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1d" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.7" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1e" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.8" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml">r</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1f" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.2.cmml">d</mi><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.3.cmml">t</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1a" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.4" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.4.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1b" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.5" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.5.cmml">p</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑆</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑎</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.5">𝑛</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.6">𝑑</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.7">𝑎</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.8">𝑟</ci><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.2">𝑑</ci><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.3">𝑡</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.4">𝑜</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.9.3.5">𝑝</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p2.1.m1.1c">Standard_{stop}</annotation></semantics></math>: There is no clear hierarchy of weight distribution within the communities.

This hybrid testbed is used to cross-validate the performance and effectiveness of corresponding models and system design. Specifically, we establish an on-device FL system based on mobile devices with different hardware configurations, including Raspberry Pi 4B, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, NVIDIA Jetson TX2, and five types of mobile phones (Honor 8 Lite, Lenovo A3580, ZTE N928Dt, MI 4C and Nexus 6). The local training process in the mobile devices is implemented based on DL4J <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and running as a background service. Communication between the devices and the central server is established using the client-server architecture.

When compared to AllSmall, SmartFreeze delivers a 16.8% performance improvement. The primary limitation of AllSmall stems from the model size being determined by the client with the smallest memory capacity, consequently impairing feature extraction capability. SmartFreeze enhances feature extraction capability through progressive model growth. In contrast to ExclusiveFL, SmartFreeze exhibits a performance improvement of 19.6%. This can be attributed to ExclusiveFL’s stringent inclusion criteria, allowing only high-memory clients to participate, resulting in a participation rate of only 3%. DepthFL employs self-distillation to facilitate information transfer among blocks. However, its limited 28% participation rate results in a 5% decrease in performance compared to SmartFreeze. Due to the disruption of the model architecture, HeteroFL results in a performance degradation of 9.2%. Both TiFL and Oort, having a mere 3% participation rates, endure an accuracy reduction of 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively.

model effectiveness and system efficiency at the same time. Through extensive experiments, SmartFreeze significantly outperforms in terms of time-to-accuracy and energy-to-accuracy metrics on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. This can be attributed to the stage-based progressive training paradigm, which involves training only a subset of parameters at each stage.
Consequently, both forward and backward propagation computation demands are substantially diminished compared to the full model training, resulting in reduced time and energy costs per round and yielding a speedup of up to 2.02<math id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We employ the following settings for comparison: (a) only train the first block, (b) given that the last block is responsible for extracting more complex features, we freeze the earlier blocks prematurely and allocate more training rounds to the final block, (c) a naive method is to allocate training rounds based on the parameter quantity of different blocks. The total number of training rounds remains consistent across all experiments.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our simulation testbed, we can achieve an average memory reduction of up to 82%.
To validate the memory efficiency of SmartFreeze on real devices, we select Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as experimental platforms, each equipped with 500 CIFAR100 data samples, to train the ResNet18 model. We use htop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to monitor the peak memory usage.

When excluding the influence of the process itself, the memory requirements in the first stage can be reduced by 39.7%-43.9%, in the second stage by 63.2%-64.8%, in the third stage by 62.9%-69.9%, and in the fourth stage by 45.6%-55.9%.

Study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> has shown that deploying pre-trained models directly without local updates can result in an inference accuracy decrease by up to 20%. Therefore, on-device training becomes crucial. ElasticTrainer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> improves computation efficiency by transitioning from a layer-based structure to a tensor-based structure, enabling prioritized training of critical tensors within time constraints.

HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> divides the model into different complexities by scaling the channels of convolutional layers, but this compromises the model architecture. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> tailors the model complexity to each client but requires additional public datasets, which is not feasible in FL.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces SmartFreeze, a framework designed to effectively reduce peak memory footprint while accounting for system and statistical heterogeneity. SmartFreeze employs a progressive training paradigm and proposes a block perturbation metric to evaluate the training progress of blocks to securely freeze them as they converge. This significantly saves computation resources for frozen blocks and the corresponding memory space used for storing intermediate outputs and gradients. Additionally, to address the statistical and system heterogeneity, we propose a graph-based community detection algorithm to choose the <em id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">right</em> devices to participate in the training for each block. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SmartFreeze on both simulation and hardware testbeds. The results demonstrate that SmartFreeze effectively reduces average memory usage by up to 82%. Moreover, it improves the model accuracy by up to 83.1% and accelerates the training process up to 2.02<math id="S7.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
