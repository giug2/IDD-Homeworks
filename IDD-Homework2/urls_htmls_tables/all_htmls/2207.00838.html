<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Estimating the travel time of a path is an essential topic for intelligent transportation systems. It serves as the foundation for real-world applications, such as traffic monitoring, route planning, and taxi dispatching. However, building a model for such a data-driven task requires a large amount of users’ travel information, which directly relates to their privacy and thus is less likely to be shared. The non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) trajectory data across data owners also make a predictive model extremely challenging to be personalized if we directly apply federated learning. Finally, previous work on travel time estimation does not consider the real-time traffic state of roads, which we argue can significantly influence the prediction. To address the above challenges, we introduce GOF-TTE for the mobile user group, <span id="id7.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">G</span>enerative <span id="id7.id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">O</span>nline <span id="id7.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated Learning Framework for <span id="id7.id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">T</span>ravel <span id="id7.id1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">T</span>ime <span id="id7.id1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">E</span>stimation, which
I) utilizes the federated learning approach, allowing private data to be kept on client devices while training,
and designs the global model as an online generative model shared by all clients to infer the real-time road traffic state.
II) apart from sharing a base model at the server, adapts a fine-tuned personalized model for every client to study their personal driving habits, making up for the residual error made by localized global model prediction.</span>
We also employ a simple privacy attack to our framework and implement the differential privacy mechanism to further guarantee privacy safety.
Finally, we conduct experiments on two real-world public taxi datasets of DiDi Chengdu and Xi’an. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the popularization of mobile devices and the maturity of real-time positioning technology, the trajectories of people and vehicles are frequently recorded, resulting in a large amount of position-based data which mainly comes from mobile phones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, public bicycles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, public transportation cards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and taxis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
These data is taken from snippets of everyday life, reflecting both individual behavior and city dynamics.
Recently the emerging idea of utilizing these data to promote the construction of smart city draws considerable attention, among which the modeling of travel time estimation (TTE) serves as a key building block. TTE is the fundamental
problem in traffic monitoring, route planning, navigation and taxi dispatching. Having an accurate prediction of the travel time for a given path not only provides convenience to the individual in travel scheduling, but also helps the traffic control center in alleviating road congestion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, although the problem has been widely studied in the past, ranging from Bayesian inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Markov chains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, to deep learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, they require the travel data from all users which, may contain sensitive identifiable information such as driving habits and locations, to be collected and then trained a model in a centralized way. These conventional methods are faced with severe privacy challenges with the increasing awareness of data security, since one must take the risk of privacy leakage when sharing his own travel information to public organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, recent progress in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> has shed light on such privacy issues. The fundamental idea of federated learning is to keep user’s data locally instead of sharing while collaboratively training a global model by exchanging only training parameters (i.e., model weights). More specifically, the centralized learning mechanism aggregates all clients’ data to the cloud sever and trains a centralized model before different clients download it. On the contrary, Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Framework Overview ‣ III Framework Design ‣ GOF-TTE: Generative Online Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (a) reveals the federated learning policy, which is proposed to train a local model with local data independently at each client/device, and then sends their model weights to the server where the
updates from different clients are integrated into the global model. The global model later in turn sent its weights to update all local model for each device/client. Ideally, the global model obtained from federated learning has similar or better results than the model obtained from centralized data training on a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

The traffic state is shown in different colors where 1) red - very congested 2) yellow - congested 3) orange - slow, and 4) green - unblocked. A comprehensive perception of the global traffic state helps a lot when planning a route or estimating travel time. </figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Learning from non-IID data is one of the major challenges
of federated learning, particularly in the case of TTE, since the travel styles and active areas vary from person to person, resulting in a highly non-IID dataset for each individual user.
While the centralized learning procedure shuffles and mixes the entire dataset to draw batches that hold almost the same data distribution, federated learning suffers when local data is non-IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the global model trained through federated learning might not perform well for each client in the presence of statistical data heterogeneity (i.e., the non-IID data from different clients). We adapt the idea from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to train an extra personalized model for each client to study his/her personal driving habit (i.e., encodes it as latent representation). The personalized model is trained towards the residual error between ground truth and the prediction from the global model. With the cooperation of both a global and personalized model, the final result can be more ”personal” and thus more accurate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, as mentioned by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, travel time relies heavily on two parts: 1) the statically spatial features of the city road graph (e.g. number of traffic lights, number of lanes, and speed limit), and 2) the dynamically changing real-time traffic condition (i.e., the traffic conditions at different time slots
are temporally-variant due to many random variables such as the daily activities of people, road works, and accidents). <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Li et al.,</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed to generate a dynamic grid-based global traffic state by combining these heterogeneous factors (both spatial and temporal) together to improve the prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, we argue that it has two important drawbacks: 1) the grid-based traffic state suffers from its coarse-grained characteristics, lacking the modeling for the state of roads, where the travel really happens. 2) its real-time traffic state is calculated manually using time slots and sub-trajectories rather than using machine learning models to generate, so it is less likely to contain the hidden and high-level traffic information such as traffic accidents. Instead of introducing another new module, we directly design our global federated learning model to be an online generative model that generates the real-time road-based traffic state tensor, inferring the estimated current travel time for each road segment and road intersection. We believe that the real-time traffic state can provide us with more timely traffic information that can have a significant improvement in our prediction. Specifically, we design a spatio-temporal cross product to produce the traffic state by fusing the spatial representations (both road segments and intersections) and the temporal embedding representations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, in the application, the global traffic state addresses even more importance in the field of the intelligent transportation system. It contributes to traffic control, route planning, vehicle scheduling, and other tasks, and plays an important role in alleviating traffic congestion and ensuring public transportation safety. Recently, many companies, such as DiDi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, Baidu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and Amap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, have applied various deep learning methods to traffic state prediction, including studying global traffic states from myriad trajectories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Thereby, our generative design in federated learning satisfies the interests of both the service provider and individuals, allowing the former to monitor the global traffic state without invading the personal privacy of city residents and providing the latter with convenience. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ GOF-TTE: Generative Online Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows one famous case from the view of both the government and individuals. For the government, the traffic state improves service efficiency, such as ride-sharing services, taxi scheduling, and TTE. For people, the traffic state announces the urban communication efficiency in real-time, which provides tips for the personal daily trip plan.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Under the background of the contradiction between the data island phenomenon and data fusion demand, federated learning has been proposed to train the model without sharing data but only exchanging training parameters in the middle stage. Ideally, the shared model obtained from federated learning has similar or better results than the model got from centralized data training on a central server. We here compare the differences between the classical federated system and our proposed framework. The direct deployment of a federated TTE framework (Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Framework Overview ‣ III Framework Design ‣ GOF-TTE: Generative Online Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (a)) for map providers (such as Amap and Google) will lead to several challenges listed as follows:</span></p>

First, the differential privacy-based protection method assumes that the attacker can obtain information about all records except the target record, and the sum of this information can be understood as the maximum background knowledge that the attacker can master.
Under this maximum background knowledge assumption, differential privacy-based protection does not need to take into account any possible background knowledge possessed by the attacker, because this background knowledge is unlikely to provide more information than maximum background knowledge.
Second, based on a solid mathematical foundation, differential privacy technology has a strict definition of privacy protection and provides a quantitative evaluation method, which makes the privacy protection level with different parameter settings comparable. In the final, there is no doubt that the privacy protection method could influence the model performance, and we need to achieve a good balance between the privacy protection and model prediction performance.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All baseline models but DeepGTT (due to structural reason) are implemented in both centralized training and federated learning strategies. For centralized training, data is shared by different users, and the model trained with shared data succeeds in capturing the universal mobility patterns and achieves better modelling performance. However, privacy issues are completely ignored. And in federated learning, the model is directly trained and executed in personal devices with only local private data. Without
sharing users’ private data, this training strategy protects the personal privacy but fails to provide competitive performance. In this paper, we also apply three federated learning strategies to our proposed system. Among them, Fed-PA and Fed-Ensemble are recent personalized federated learning strategies for urban computing.</p>

We trained the models using SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001 on both Chengdu and Xi’an datasets, and early stopping is applied to avoid overfitting. For the hyper-parameters of federated training, we set clients=1000, local epoch=2 in several federated learning strategies, <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> except for our proposed training strategy <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Base + Personalized</span>. This is because the local training of our prediction model is a two-step training process.

From these results, we first find that centralized training usually achieves better performance than federated training regarding the same prediction model. On the other hand, the best performances are both achieved by privacy-leakage DeepTTE. Furthermore, we can conclude that our proposed method is superior to other privacy-preserving models. First, our global model combined with the personalized model achieves the best performance among privacy-preserving models with an improvement of 12.67% and 7.85% under two datasets, even though it still has competitive performance compared with the best privacy-leakage models. Second, our federated training procedure also performs better than other federated learning strategies, such as Fed-PA and Fed-Ensemble. Besides, only the global model with Fed-Avg has achieved near the performance of DeepTTE with Fed-Avg. This means that the trained traffic states of local drivers have extreme reliability. In summary, our proposed methods achieve promising performance while protecting personal privacy in federated training.</p>

As we have heard, since traffic state tends to be congested during the rush hours, it is a challenge to accurately estimate travel time. We take an example for Chengdu datasets, our proposed framework that integrates with the personalized model, still improves at least 15%, 16%, and 8% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. In terms of non-rush hours, our model obtains at least 18%, 6%, and 15% improvement in these three metrics.

Generally, we can observe that the final performance is improved continuously, with the number of clients increasing from 400 to 1000 for both datasets. This indicates that the generated global traffic states need large amounts of users’ trajectories to train. We also study the effects of the local training epoch of the localized global model on the system performance in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V Experiments ‣ GOF-TTE: Generative Online Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(c) and Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V Experiments ‣ GOF-TTE: Generative Online Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(d). We find that local epoch=2 and local epoch=1 are the optimal settings for Xi’an and Chengdu datasets, respectively.

Comparing the aggregated road condition and ground truth, the generated traffic states under the selected client’s two settings are similar to the ground truth. Most road segments have the same road states. Furthermore, we find that the more clients participate in the federated aggregation process, the more accurate the global traffic state will be.</p>

The road segment based methods use the speed data sampled from loop detectors to infer each individual road segment’s travel time independently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> but ignore the correlations between the
road segments, such as the factors of traffic lights, and left/right turns. Path based approaches have been proposed to resolve those issues, which can roughly be divided into two types: 1) nearest neighbor search <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, which estimates the travel time by averaging the historical trajectories’ travel time. 2) trajectory regression methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which predicts the travel time of road segments via public features, for instance, road types, road lanes, road length, etc.</p>

For instance, DeepTTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> presents an end-to-end framework that predicts the travel time of the whole path directly by using geo-convolution on the GPS

to learn the travel time distribution for each road segment using grid-based traffic conditions and basic road network features. <span id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Wang et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> models the problem of travel time estimation as a spatio-temporal regression problem by a Wide-Deep-Recurrent learning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, and this work considers various features including spatial information (the characteristics of route, such as the road segment and traffic light information), temporal information (such as a month and a day, the holiday indicator), traffic information (such as estimated road condition) and personalized information (such as driver profile).

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Graph Neural Network Based Methods.</span> Very recently, the
advances of graph neural network have promoted a myriad of work in travel time estimation problem. For example, ConSTGAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> employs a graph attention
mechanism onto the spatial-temporal features by integrating traffic and contextual information, <span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">in which the input feature includes the road segment-based information, historical road condition and departure time of each trajectory.</span> Deepist <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> enhances the power of convolutional neural network to capture moving behaviors embedded in paths by introducing the image of urban in grid level. <span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">GraphTTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> designs a Multi-layer Spatio-temporal Graph frame, which consists of static and dynamic networks. In particular, the dynamic networks implement the GCN and gate recurrent unit to model the historical traffic characteristics, and the static network employs GCN to model the basic road attributes. Especially, <span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Hong et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> transforms the road network into a multi-relational network and introduce a vehicle-trajectories based network to jointly consider the traffic behavior pattern (traffic speed, volume).</span></p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However, those graph-based approaches ignore the complex relations between road segments and intersections from road network. Meanwhile, their methods need to model the real traffic dynamics, which is difficult to acquire due to the power and communication limitations of mobile devices. In this
paper, we model the adjacencies in both node-wise graph and link-wise graph simultaneously. And the online traffic state can be obtained via our aggregated global model.</span></p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">User Data Protection Mechanisms.</span> a series of techniques aiming to protect the user trajectories have been proposed, which can be classified with two categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>: 1) real-time continuous location-based services, and 2) publication of historical trajectories. The former intends to protect the scenario, for example, asking the Apps to give the traffic
conditions that are 1 km around me. Multiple techniques have been proposed including spatial cloaking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, mix zones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and path confusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. The latter schemes to protect the trajectories, and its related works include clustering-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, generalization-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, suppression-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, and grid-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> approaches.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning.</span> It is a mechanism to coordinate the joint training model of multiple participants, which is emerging in the era of big data and the development of artificial intelligence technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, communication cost and communication efficiency have become one of the key bottlenecks of federated learning. A bunch of work has been proposed to analyze how to reduce the communication cost of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. Further, federated learning does not exchange data directly and has a higher privacy guarantee than traditional centralized machine learning training, but federated learning itself does not provide comprehensive and sufficient privacy protection.
Recently, researchers have applied differential privacy operation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> on the whole model in the aggregation stage of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Personalized Federated Learning.</span> Personalized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> differs from traditional federated learning in that it does not require all participants to end up using the same model, but allows each participant to fine-tune the model based on their own data to generate their own unique personalized model. Models often perform better on local test sets after personalized tweaks. A bunch of work has been proposed from meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, hypernetwork <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> to personalized model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>. For example, the goal of meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> is to train highly adaptive models that can be trained to solve new tasks in a small number of samples.And in multitasking learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, models among the clients learn together by taking advantage of commonalities and differences between tasks.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In allusion to the TTE problem, this paper proposes an online personalized federated learning framework to fill the gap between personal privacy and model performance by dynamically updating the global traffic state. Specifically, we estimate the travel time through the training strategy of the <span id="S7.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">base model + personalized model</span>, where the base model serves to produce the unbiased global traffic state for all clients, and the latter is only trained locally to act on fitting the personalized driving habits through the profile features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework from three aspects: 1) overall performance compared with state-of-the-art in travel time estimation models and federated learning strategies; 2) a case study depicting the global state from links and nodes, respectively, to show the aggregation performance of our system. 3) privacy risk analysis from both quantitative and qualitative views, respectively, to prove the effectiveness of our privacy-preserving mechanism.</span></p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In the future, we will further test the performance with more federated learning strategies, such as clustering the personal driving features together, since the drivers’ habits have multiple similarities. Meanwhile, we will also reduce the communication cost since the online algorithm frequently needs to upload and download model weight between clients and the cloud server.</span></p>
