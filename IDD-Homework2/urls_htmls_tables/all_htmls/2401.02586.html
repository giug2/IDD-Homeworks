One of the most challenging issues in federated learning is that the data is often not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Clients are expected to contribute the same type of data and drawn from one global distribution. However, data are often collected in different ways from different resources. Thus, the data distributions among clients might be different from the underlying global distribution. This creates a weight divergence issue and reduces federated learning performance. This work focuses on improving federated learning performance for skewed data distribution across clients. The main idea is to adjust the client distribution closer to the global distribution using sample weights. Thus, the machine learning model converges faster with higher accuracy. We start from the fundamental concept of empirical risk minimization and theoretically derive a solution for adjusting the distribution skewness using sample weights. To determine sample weights, we implicitly exchange density information by leveraging a neural network-based density estimation model, MADE. The clients’ data distribution can then be adjusted without exposing their raw data. Our experiment results on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method not only improves federated learning accuracy but also significantly reduces communication costs compared to the other experimental methods.</span></p>

<p id="p2.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="p2.2.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en-US">Non-IID issue is a well-known problem in machine learning applications, especially for Federated Learning, as clients often collect data from different sources and in different conditions. The problem significantly reduces machine learning performance and increases communication costs. To alleviate the nagative impact of non-IID data, several works have been proposed. However, they mostly require clients to share part of their private data or rely on the global information from the global model, which already suffered the non-IID. In this work, the proposed method adjusts the distribution via sample weight in the loss function during training. We only ask clients to share some extra models. Similar to a typical FL framework, clients are not required to expose their raw data. The results on three real-world datasets showed that the proposed method is much more efficient than other experimental methods. It increases the accuracy of ML model and significantly reduces communication costs e.i., up to eight times for real non-IID dataset FEMNIST.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the demand for massive data in artificial intelligent machines, federated learning (FL) was first introduced in 2016, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, a collaboratively decentralized learning framework, in contrast to centralized learning approaches (in which datasets are sent to an aggregator), FL encourages data holders to contribute without the privacy concern of exposing their raw data. For example, a number of hospitals holding patient records would participate in a machine learning (ML) system to provide better disease predictions via a FL framework without the concern of privacy disclosure. An FL framework is then set up to train a global machine learning model with the participation of all hospitals (clients) and an aggregator coordinating the model transfer between clients and the aggregator. Instead of sharing raw data, each client trains their ML model for a small number of iterations and updates the model parameters to the aggregator. The aggregator then merges all clients’ model parameters into a new global model and sends them back to the clients for further training iterations. Clients receive the global model and continue to train for the next iterations. The process is repeated until the global model is fully trained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because the data in such collaborative learning usually come from different sources, they might be drawn from local distributions that are different from the underlying global distribution. This can be considered a non-IID issue, and it might cause a performance reduction. <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\Copy</span>para:motivationThe primary problem is the divergence of model weights, as found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> by Zhao et al. The authors showed that the model’s weights tend to be more diverged for non-IID data compared to that for IDD data. This causes a performance reduction, and it worsens as the data distribution becomes more skewed. For example, the accuracy dropped by about 10% for image dataset Cifar-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and speech recognition dataset KWS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> with a non-IID setting. In FL, this issue arises due to differences between client individual distribution and the global distribution. <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\Copy</span>sec:introductionTo address this problem, we proposed an algorithm that utilizes sample weights to adjust individual client distributions closer to the global distribution during the training process. However, obtaining global information across clients is challenging in an FL setting because clients need to allow the exposure of their raw data. To overcome this challenge, the proposed method implicitly shares statistical information of client data without revealing the client’s raw data. The method only requires clients to exchange additional model weights using a typical FL procedure. Once the adjustment weights are acquired, the machine learning model can be trained using a standard FL framework. The proposed method is demonstrated to improve FL accuracy and significantly reduce FL communication costs through experiments on three real-world datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To learn a model utilizing data from multiple clients without directly accessing clients’ data, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> first introduced Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and demonstrated its robustness in 2016. The main idea is that clients (data holders) are involved in a model training process by exchanging local models’ parameters instead of exchanging raw data. Since then, FL has been seen in various applications in different fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Federated Learning can be categorized into two primary scenarios: cross-silo and cross-device FL. In the former, there are fewer clients, each having substantial data (such as hospitals). In contrast, the latter scenario involves numerous clients with lightweight devices, and each client may have a smaller dataset (like mobile users). One of the main concerns in FL is that the data might come from different sources and have different distributions. Thus, FL performance is significantly reduced because this violates a fundamental machine learning assumption that data should be independent and identically distributed (IID). The FL over non-IID data has been shown in existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> that its performance deteriorates dramatically. In this work, we focus on tackling the non-IID data issue in a federated learning system in which the collected data feature distribution is skewed. Many different reasons might cause the skewness. For example, clients might perform different sampling methods, apply different normalization methods, or sample using different devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past few years, there have been a number of approaches aiming at reducing non-IID data impacts. While many current works focus on skewed label distribution, there are only limited approaches considering skewed feature distribution data, which is very common in various fields, e.g., medical images collected from different X-ray machines. We classify the existing works into three categories as follows.</p>

This approach mainly focuses on adjusting model weights or calibrating model parameters using sharing data. However, they require a certain amount of raw data to be shared among users. For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed an alleviation by finetuning the model on globally shared data to adjust the distribution drift. Thus, this still poses a privacy concern. Zhu et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> used adversarial training and shared the generator for generating synthetic samples, which might contain global information. However, training generators also suffered from the non-IID itself.</p>

This approach focuses on stabilizing the local training process by regulating the deviation between local parameters and global parameters. This could be implemented by normalizing layers, adding regularization terms in loss functions, or sharing specific layers. For example, Li et al. illustrated in their work (FedBN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that Local Batch Normalization would help to reduce the problem of non-IID data. FedBN suggests clients not synchronize local batch normalization parameters with the global model. Sahu et al. introduce FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to solve the weight-divergence issue by proposing a loss function that constrains the local models to stay close to the global model. FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> suggests to normalize local weights before synchronizing with the aggregator. FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, AFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and PFNM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> consider combinations of layer-wise parameters and provide an aggregation of such parameters to alleviate the non-IID issue. In FedRod <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, Chen and Chao deal with the non-IID issue by learning hyper-networks locally, which results in personalized classifiers for clients and clients’ class distributions. Recently, Tan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> tackled the non-IID data issue by exchanging representation vectors of samples in a given class instead of the model’s parameters, enabling clients to have personalized model architecture.</p>

The approach mitigates heterogeneity by adjusting the model weight during aggregation. However, this works on the model level, so it is ineffective if the data is non-IID within a client. FedCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and FedDNA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> share statistical parameters of models (means and variances) and aim at finding averaging weights for each client’s model to minimize models’ weights divergence across clients. However, as this approach only considers the aggregating weights for each model, the improvement is minor.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed method asks the clients to share additional model weights that carry their local datasets’ distribution information instead of sharing the raw data. We utilize a neural network-based density estimation, namely, Masked Autoencoder for Distribution Estimation (MADE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. This section briefly introduces MADE.</p>

<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">

In this section, a solution is proposed to alleviate the negative impact of distribution skewness across clients for federated learning by adjusting client data distribution during the training process. The proposed method aims to find weights for training samples in order to adjust client data distributions. The remainder of this section introduces how we design sample weights. We also show that the goal in Equation <a href="#S3.E1" title="In 3 Problem Statement ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> can be derived from the machine learning optimization problem as described in this section.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By applying the sample weights for the local training on each client, the proposed method reduces the distribution skewness of each client’s data and prevents clients’ raw data from being exposed. Some statistical information between clients and the aggregator must be exchanged to find sample weights. However, instead of exchanging the raw information, which might hurt clients’ privacy, the proposed method only exchanges model parameters, similar to a typical Fl framework.</p>

The proposed method, namely FedDisk, requires a 2-phase process. First, clients jointly learn a global density estimation model and their local density models utilizing MADE models. These models are then used to derive sample weights for the local training process. Second, the machine learning tasks can be learned by the conventional FL procedure, with the data skewness issue mitigated by the sample weights from the first phase.</p>

The sample weights could be estimated by the density ratio between the true distribution (global distribution) and the client distributions (local distributions). For each client, the local distribution can be estimated using its local data. However, the challenge is to achieve the true distribution without having access to other clients’ data. To solve this, we leverage a neural network-based density estimation model to learn the global density function via a typical federated learning procedure. Thus, clients can implicitly exchange some statistical information, while still preserving the privacy in client data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">In this section, we examine the idea of using sample weight for non-IID data and the FedDisk sample weight effectiveness by looking at the case when the weights are derived directly from the raw data. Specifically, instead of learning sample weights from the local and global MADE model output, the weights are learned directly from the raw local and global data. To obtain the global data, we combine all client’s data and randomly sample the same number of the client dataset size to avoid data imbalance. This setting variant of FedDisk (namely FedDiskAb) is an ideal case for a sample weight-based approach as it assumes to have access to the raw data. To obtain sample weights, FedDiskAb only needs to train the binary classifier on the combination of local data and global data, aiming to discriminate the two datasets. The classifier’s output is used to derive the sample weight, similar to FedDisk.</span></p>

The outcome demonstrates that both FedDiskAb and FedDisk surpass the performance of all alternative methods. This confirms the effectiveness of the sample weight-based strategy, whether acquired through learning the distribution from MADE models or directly from the data, in enhancing federated learning when faced with non-IID challenges. Furthermore, the performance of FedDisk closely aligns with that of FedDiskAb. This shows the fact that the local and global MADE models contribute significantly to the framework’s ability to capture essential distribution information, much akin to the process of direct learning from the raw data. The details of the experimental results will be shown in Chapter </span><a href="#S7" title="7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a><span id="S6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

Our FL system goal is to learn a global classifier leveraging data from all clients. The classification accuracy is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The communication cost is evaluated by counting the number of iterations needed for clients to exchange model parameters with the aggregator. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods, e.i., FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, FedROD and FedPCL.</span></p>

The models are constructed by two 5x5 convolutional layers (32 and 32 channels for Chest-Xray, 128 and 128 channels for FEMNIST, 16 and 16 channels for MNIST). Each convolutional layer is followed by 2x2 max pooling and batch normalization layers. A fully connected layer with 16 neurons is added on the top of the models. The input and output sizes are designed to fit each dataset scenario (i.e., image size and the number of unique labels). We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 for the optimizers. Local iterations are set to 2 for all datasets. Global iterations are set to 1500 for FEMNIST and MNIST, and 500 for Chest-Xray.</span></p>

Several experiments were conducted to select the optimal set of parameters which yield lowest loss value. The networks include input, output and one hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is tuned from a value set of {30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400}. The final selected number of neurons in the hidden layer are 50, 400, 30 for XRAY, FEMNIST and MNIST datasets, respectively. We noticed that using more neurons than numbers above did not significantly decrease the validation loss, thus they are the optimal settings. The model’s input and output sizes are set to the flattened size of images. Specifically, the input and output size for MNIST and FEMNIST datasets is 784 with image sizes of 28x28 pixels. This number is 1024 (32x32 pixels) for Chest-Xray dataset. The maximum training iteration is set to 500, and the training process is stopped when the validation loss starts increasing.

Figure </span><a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.3.1 Classification Accuracy ‣ 7.3 Results ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a><span id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> show the aggregated training loss and validation loss for the global MADE model over communication rounds. The global MADE exchanging process stops when the validation loss starts increasing. For example, the proposed method needs 15 rounds for exchanging global MADE models in the case of the FEMNIST dataset (Figure </span><a href="#S7.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 7.3.1 Classification Accuracy ‣ 7.3 Results ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a><span id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">). The ECR for FedDisk in the classification phase is calculated with the number of iterations the method needs to achieve the highest value among other methods gained. Take the FEMNIST dataset experiment shown in Figure </span><a href="#S7.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 7.3 Results ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a><span id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;"> for example, FedDisk only needs 105 rounds to reach FedROD’s accuracy at 57% which is the highest accuracy among other experimental methods. Plus 15 rounds to exchange MADE model, FedDisk only needs a total of 120 rounds to effectively reach the top comparison method accuracy. Since other methods don’t need to exchange extra models, the ECRs are calculated by the number of rounds to exchange classification model until they reach their highest accuracy values.</span></p>

FedDisk mechanism has two phases; one is to transfer MADE models, and the other is to exchange classifiers. The overall FedDisk ECR comprises the communication rounds in the two phases. As shown in the Table, FedDisk is the most effective method as it needs many fewer communication rounds to reach the highest accuracy among other methods. This is because the proposed method only needs a few number communication rounds for the global MADE model to be converged. Besides, the weight-based adjustment converges the global classification model much faster than others. For example, the FedDisk ECR for FEMNIST is only 120 (15 for MADE model exchange plus 105 for classification model exchange), whereas others take more than 1000 iterations.</span></p>

Since the transferred data mainly contains model weights, our study uses the number of model weights to estimate the overhead size.

Noticeably, the communication cost reduced significantly for the FEMNIST dataset under the proposed method, 8 times, from the second lowest cost method of 907,000,000 (FedROD, brown column) to 112,000,000 (FedDisk, green column). The communication cost reduction trend is also applied to other experimental datasets, Chest-Xray (1.4 times) and MNIST (1.6 times). Thus, the proposed method improves accuracy and dramatically reduces communication costs, one of the most critical concerns in Federated Learning. This is because the loss function were reduced faster as we adjusted using the sample weights.

<p id="S7.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">The proposed method offers a holistic improvement over existing federated learning methods. Its combination of enhanced accuracy and reduced communication costs signifies its effectiveness across a variety of datasets and scenarios. For example, the accuray can be increased by 22% and the communication time reduced by 8 times for FEMNIST dataset.
While FedDisk exhibits remarkable performance across various metrics in federated learning scenarios, it’s important to acknowledge a drawback associated with its larger model size compared to some other methods as described in Table </span><a href="#S7.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 7.3.2 Effective Communication Rounds ‣ 7.3 Results ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a><span id="S7.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">. The increased model size leads to higher space occupation on client devices, which can have implications for light weight devices with limited storage capacity. Hence, the suggested approach could be well-suited for the cross-silo scenario, typically characterized by clients having ample data and adequate computational capabilities.
Overal, the proposed approach provides an avenue to address critical challenges in federated learning, making it a promising option for real-world applications.</span></p>

Similar to many other works, we utilize additional information to alleviate the negative impact of non-IID data, i.e., parameters of MADE models. However, these parameters might contain distribution information of clients’ data. However, we prove that the more clients are involved in the FL training process, the less our extra information is leaked. The detail is described as follows.</span></p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">In this work, we have proposed an FL method to tackle the issue of data distribution skewness. The technique utilizes an FL framework and a neural network-based density estimation model to derive training sample weights. This helps to adjust the individual distribution without revealing clients’ raw data. Thus, the global model loss is converged faster and more accurately. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves FL accuracy and significantly reduces communication costs. We also provide a privacy analysis for the extra information used in FedDisk (i.e., the parameters of MADE models) and prove that the leakage information becomes less important when the number of clients increases. To advance our research, we intend to fine-tune the parameters of the MADE model and investigate various distribution models in order to potentially achieve improved outcomes and have a greater impact on real-world applications. More analysis on privacy vulnerabilities and potential attacks will also be our future research.</span></p>
