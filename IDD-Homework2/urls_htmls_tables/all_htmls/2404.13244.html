<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">Auction-based federated learning (AFL) is an important emerging category of FL incentive mechanism design, due to its ability to fairly and efficiently motivate high-quality data owners to join data consumers’ (i.e., servers’) FL training tasks. To enhance the efficiency in AFL decision support for stakeholders (i.e., data consumers, data owners, and the auctioneer), intelligent agent-based techniques have emerged. However, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field and the lack of a comprehensive survey providing an accessible perspective, it is a challenge for researchers to enter and contribute to this field. This paper bridges this important gap by providing a first-of-its-kind survey on the <span id="id15.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">I</span>ntelligent <span id="id15.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>gents for <span id="id15.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">AFL</span> (<span id="id15.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span>) literature. We propose a unique multi-tiered taxonomy that organises existing <span id="id15.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span> works according to 1) the stakeholders served, 2) the auction mechanism adopted, and 3) the goals of the agents, to provide readers with a multi-perspective view into this field. In addition, we analyse the limitations of existing approaches, summarise the commonly adopted performance evaluation metrics, and discuss promising future directions leading towards effective and efficient stakeholder-oriented decision support in <span id="id15.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span> ecosystems.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm that is able to train useful models while respecting user privacy and data confidentiality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Konečnỳ <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Zhang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. FL has gained significant attention from academia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu and others (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>)</cite> alike, leading to a diverse range of techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In FL, there are two types of participants: <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data consumers</span> (DCs, who often perform the role of FL servers), overseeing the distribution and aggregation of global FL models, and <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data owners</span> (DOs, who often play the role of FL clients), responsible for training the FL model using their local data. FL follows a distributed approach where each DO trains a local model on its private dataset, and shares it with the corresponding DC. The DC then aggregates the received local models following an aggregation algorithm (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan and others (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>) to obtain the global model, which is then distributed back to the DOs for further training until convergence criteria are met. This design ensures that private local data are not exposed to any party other than the original owner, thus reducing privacy risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these advantages, existing FL works generally assume that all DOs agree to participate in the FL training process when requested <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thi Le and others (<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, in practice, DOs are self-interested entities who consider a complex set of factors (e.g., costs, potential risks of privacy exposure, expected utility gains) before deciding to join an FL task. This has motivated the study of FL incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Khan and others (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, which aims to develop effective mechanisms that align the interests of DOs with the goals of DCs. They play a crucial role in encouraging DOs to actively participate in FL and make valuable contributions, ultimately leading to improved performance and broader adoption of FL in real-world applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Auction-based approaches have gained significant attention recently as an effective way to design FL incentive mechanisms. They offer a promising approach to motivating DOs to participate in FL in a fair and efficient manner. Under the typical auction-based FL (AFL) setting<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>A possible example open AFL marketplace can be the Hierarchical Auctioning in Crowd-based Federated Learning system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>: https://hacfl.federated-learning.org/.</span></span></span>, three key stakeholders are involved: 1) DCs, 2) DOs, and 3) an auctioneer (as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Intelligent Agents for Auction-based Federated Learning: A Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The auctioneer plays a crucial role in coordinating the auction process, while DOs and DCs provide the auctioneer with their available data resources and bid values, respectively. The auction process as well as the entire AFL ecosystem center around the decision-making process of each stakeholder. The decisions made by each stakeholder impact the outcomes of AFL. To deal with the complexity, dynamism and personal nature of the context and the decision-making process, intelligent agents are often adopted to provide these stakeholders with AFL decision support, thereby inspiring the field of <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">I</span>ntelligent <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>gents for <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">AFL</span> (<span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span>).</p>

It requires expertise from machine learning, multi-agent systems, game theory and auction theory, etc. This makes it challenging for researchers new to the field to grasp the latest developments. Currently, there is no survey paper on this important and rapidly developing field. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey of research works focusing on <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span> in this paper.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Although some of the papers included in this survey do not explicitly mention agents, their focus on providing decision support for stakeholders in AFL reflects their potential as useful building blocks for realizing an agent-based AFL system.</span></span></span> We analyse the AFL ecosystem in detail, with a focus on the diverse stakeholders involved and their decision-making priorities. Based on this analysis, we propose a unique multi-tiered taxonomy of <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IA-AFL</span> that organises existing works according to 1) the stakeholders served, 2) the auction mechanism adopted, and 3) the goals of the agents to provide readers with a multi-perspective view into this field.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DCs submit their bidding profiles (including the bidding prices and their FL tasks) to the auctioneer.

The auctioneer determines the winners, and the corresponding market prices based on the submitted asking profiles and the bidding profiles under a predefined auction mechanism, and informs the winners. The winning DCs then pay the DOs. Through such an auction process, each DC recruits DOs to join its FL task. Afterward, each DC orchestrates the FL model training process with its recruited DOs following an adopted FL protocol.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu and others (<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, a multi-bid auction mechanism is introduced to address bandwidth allocation challenges for self-interested DCs. The primary objective is to maximize the utility of DCs. Under this method, DCs submit bidding profiles specifying their requested bandwidth and unit price to the auctioneer. The auctioneer then allocates the bandwidth to DCs based on the market clearing price, and each DC incurs charges according to the SPSB auction mechanism.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lim and others (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, the focus is on multiple DCs engaging in competitive bidding for data resources from a specific DO. The bids from DCs undergo a transformation, and the winning DCs are selected, with payments determined using the SPSB auction mechanism. The overarching objective is to maximize the utility of the DO.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ng and others (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite> incorporate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to enhance communication between DOs and DCs.

In such cases, resource allocation strategies should consider both the bandwidth and computing resources of the DOs. Exploring and adapting auction mechanisms to address the complexities arising from DOs’ simultaneous involvement in multiple FL tasks is an open research question.</p>

This implies that the initiation of auctions relies on having a sufficient number of available bidders. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zeng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, the model aggregator initiates the process of determining winners once a satisfactory number of bids from DOs is received. In such offline auctions, both the DOs and the DCs may experience prolonged waiting times, even if they do not emerge as the eventual auction winners. This can discourage potential participants from actively engaging in the AFL marketplace. In contrast, online auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang and others (<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> empowers the auctioneer, DCs and DOs to make real-time decisions, such as selecting winners and determining payments, as soon as a participant joins the auction.
