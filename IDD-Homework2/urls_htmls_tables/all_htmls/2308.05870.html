<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To satisfy the broad applications and insatiable hunger for deploying
low latency multimedia data classification and data privacy in a cloud-based setting, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important learning paradigm.
For the practical cases involving
limited computational power and only unlabeled data in many wireless communications applications, this work investigates FL paradigm in a resource-constrained and label-missing environment. Specifically, we propose a novel framework of UFed-GAN: Unsupervised Federated Generative Adversarial Network, which can capture user-side data distribution without local
classification training. We also analyze the convergence and privacy of the proposed UFed-GAN. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of UFed-GAN in addressing limited computational resources and unlabeled data while preserving privacy.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The burgeoning rise of deep learning has shown remarkable achievements in learning, based on the often voluminous amounts of data for centralized training. However, in many cases of
learning-based wireless connections
for collaboration, decentralized learning is vital to handle the heterogeneous data distribution among nodes (users). Importantly, privacy concerns and resource limitations also prevent direct data sharing. To ensure data privacy and communication efficiency, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has emerged as an important framework to disengage data collection and model training via local computation and global model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite reported successes, existing FL frameworks have certain limitations. One major obstacle of
FL in practice is the heterogeneity of data distribution among participating FL users. It is known
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that the accuracy of classic FL frameworks such as
FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> could drop by 55% for some datasets showing
non-IID, i.e., not identically and independently distributed, data distributions. To combat performance loss against non-IID datasets, the
more general approach of FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
may depend on certain unrealistic dissimilarity assumptions of local functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, generative adversarial network (GAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> provides another approach to address data heterogeneity. In GAN-based FL, GAN models are used as a proxy to share user updates without training the global model on the user side. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, a global classifier is trained using a user-shared generator of the user-end-trained conditional GANs (cGANs). Another example is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed to share the full user-end GAN for generating a synthetic dataset. However, the high communication cost and the potential privacy leakage hinder the performance gain of these
known GAN-based FL frameworks as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the training of the entire GAN and other learning models sometimes can be impractical at the user end, especially for nodes with limited computation resources, such as computation-constrained sensors and devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. How to develop a more efficient GAN-sharing strategy to preserve privacy and handle limited computation remains an open question in generative FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to data heterogeneity and limited computation resources, most of the existing works focus on supervised FL, where the performance depends heavily on the availability of labeled training data. In practical applications such as user clustering and video segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the computational and privacy limitations may prevent user-side data labeling. Therefore, learning from unlabeled data is equally important for FL to reach its full potential.
Presently, only limited research
works have specifically addressed FL with unlabeled data, primarily due to inherent challenges. A typical category of FL dealing with unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> focuses on clustering tasks, which may limit its generalization to other deep learning tasks. Another line of FL focuses on unsupervised representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where knowledge distillation and contrast learning are applied to address heterogeneous user data distributions.
Other FL works on unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> leverage the efficiency of latent space and may lack a general description of the original data. As aforementioned, GAN-based approaches can be intuitive solutions to capture the data distributions and assist further applications, even without annotated labels.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we develop a novel FL framework, the Unsupervised Federated Generative Adversarial Network (UFed-GAN), for resource-limited distributed users without labeled data. The novelty is an innovative GAN-based FL and data-sharing strategy
to significantly reduce the computational cost at the user end and
to preserve privacy. Note that, instead of focusing on one specific unsupervised learning task, we provide a general FL scheme to learn the data distributions without labels. Our framework can be easily adapted to
handle specific learning tasks, including unsupervised representation learning, user clustering, and semi-supervised classification.</p>

user nodes, each with limited computational resources whereas attackers may attempt to eavesdrop on the network links. Users may not be able to annotate their raw data. Moreover, since the target tasks may be different among users and the data may also be skewed, a non-IID data distribution shall be considered in this scenario. Different from local users, the server has sufficient computational resources to obtain a model that learns a global data distribution from all the local data, without initial training data. Such a setup is applicable in many distributed learning scenarios. For example, a distributed camera/sensor system placed for object detection can benefit from the collaboration of different cameras for better feature extraction, where each digital
camera or sensor may have limited computation power.</p>

This proposition serves as a guarantee of the convergence of the server-side discriminator. It shows that the discriminator is still capable of capturing the user side’s data distribution. This helps the generator on the server-side to generate user-like data as illustrated in the following proposition.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider three well-known datasets: CIFAR10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, SVHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and FashionMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Comparative results against five other FL algorithms are
presented in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Evaluation of the Utility ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ UFed-GAN: A Secure Federated Learning Framework with Constrained Computation and Unlabeled Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
These algorithms are: FedSimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, FedMoco <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, FedBYOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, FedProtoCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and FedU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. For each method, we present their accuracy on the respective dataset, together with their accuracy when further applying FedX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From the results, UFed-GAN outperforms all other FL methods in the benchmark group, with an improvement of around 8% in CIFAR10, 3% in SVHN, and 2% in FashionMNIST.
The accuracy gain arises from the power of GANs to understand the underlying data distribution of users and to generate synthetic data by preserving essential features.
Another observation is that UFed-GAN is
dataset-agnostic in terms of performance, delivering the best outputs
in all tested datasets.
This observation promotes the generalizability of the proposed method.
In fact, UFed-GAN achieves similar performance as with full GAN sharing.
However, full GAN sharing is prone to severe privacy leakage as shown in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and additionally requires heavy computation
at each user node, which is in conflict with the FL objective of privacy preservation and conserving computation resources for
users.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we develop a novel framework of UFed-GAN to address the challenges imposed
by the lack of labeled data and by limited local computation resources in federated learning. Moreover, we propose a separate training strategy and a sharing scheme based on DCGANs. We provide an analysis of the convergence and privacy
leakage of the proposed framework. Our empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of UFed-GAN
in comparison against benchmark FL methods. We plan to investigate the communication overhead reduction for GAN-based FL and the application of semantic learning in distributed learning in future works.</p>
