<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently found favour in the multi-antenna-aided wireless downlink, as a benefit of relaxing the accuracy of Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), while in achieving high spectral efficiency and providing security guarantees. These benefits are particularly important in high-velocity vehicular platoons since their high Doppler affects the estimation accuracy of the CSIT. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RSMA-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) solution that jointly considers platoon control and FEderated Edge Learning (FEEL) in the downlink. Specifically, the proposed framework is designed for transmitting the unicast control messages within the IoV platoon, as well as for privacy-preserving FEEL-aided downlink Non-Orthogonal Unicasting and Multicasting (NOUM). Given this sophisticated framework, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize both the latency of the FEEL downlink and the deviation of the vehicles within the platoon. To efficiently solve this problem, a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework is developed for decoupling the main multi-objective problem into two sub-problems. Then, for solving these non-convex sub-problems, a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) method is developed for solving the FEEL-based downlink problem and platoon control problem, respectively. Our simulation results show that the proposed RSMA-based IoV system outperforms both the popular Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU–LP) and the conventional Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system. Finally, the BCD framework is shown to generate near-optimal solutions at reduced complexity.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the smart city concept stimulated many innovative ideas and applications for enhancing the quality of life in urban areas. Through incorporating innovative Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the quality and efficacy of various urban operations and services have been improved with the aid of the urban Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In this context, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have played a conducive role in harnessing the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving has brought about great challenges for organizing and managing large-scale Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Vehicular platooning has been proposed as a promising solution to address this problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The vehicular platoon enables several AVs to be controlled and managed in a cooperative manner relying on the IoV concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since the vehicular platoons are operated in a semi-autonomous control mode, these vehicles are capable of supporting additional services via their spare computing power, such as distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These services further impose challenging demands on communication. Some services require multicasting transmission, while others require unicasting transmission e.g. video streaming. To support this hybrid communication scenario, an efficient IoV system is desired.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several existing studies have investigated the design of low-latency V2X communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The deployment of such techniques in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) can help improve traffic efficiency and road safety in urban areas. When considering the development of communication systems, 5G V2X communication systems are capable of enhancing the vehicular performance, while improving the traffic efficiency in smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, relying for example on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). However, since NOMA was shown to be outperformed by Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), we investigate its performance in V2X communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The application and impact of RSMA in wireless communication systems have been extensively studied in the literature of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, most existing works are developed based on the users engaged in downlink communications, hence they are not applicable to vehicular networks due to the stochastic nature of vehicular movements. To tackle this issue, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> analyzed the feasibility of RSMA-based communication systems in conjunction with diverse vehicle mobility patterns. In practice, reliable wireless communications play a crucial role in facilitating vehicular operations. For instance, a vehicular platoon constitutes a promising vehicular management strategy, which requires efficient wireless transmission in support of safe driving by keeping the inter-vehicle distance in each lane. This increases the road capacity of each lane and reduces the fuel consumption of each vehicle. Existing studies focus on the implementation of efficient wireless communication protocols conceived for vehicular platoons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.

It provides a privacy-preserving approach to realize a large-scale learning system in an efficient and scalable manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In FEEL, without sacrificing the model accuracy, the metric of interest is to minimize the total training time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Many well-known FEEL mechanisms have been proposed since the first work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, where the FEEL is synchronous. Specifically, in each iteration, the edge server has to receive the local models from all workers before the next communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

Though asynchronous FL can well tackle the edge heterogeneity, it requires frequent model transfers, resulting in massive communication resource consumption.

Additionally, Mei <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> jointly optimized the radio resource allocation in the LTE-V2V network and the associated control parameters of IoVs. The objective of this work was to minimize the tracking error of vehicles and guarantee the reliability of V2V communication. An AV motion planning strategy was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which was based on motion prediction and V2V communication. Since the NOMA principle is capable of increasing the capacity, the associated uplink transmission power allocation problem was formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, in the context of a UAV platoon system. Each UAV acted as a relay assisting in inter-vehicle communications. The problem of NOMA-based resource allocation was formulated and analyzed in V2X systems in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, the aforementioned studies do not consider the utilization of RSMA in their platoon. Therefore, due to the inevitable channel estimation error and the limited CSI feedback <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, IoV platoons tend to suffer from packet loss during their information sharing since the position and velocity information become outdated and may lead to accidents.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, the RSMA-based IoV system provides reliable and robust wireless communication for the IoV system of the vehicular platoon. By relying on the RSMA, the vehicular platoon has less probability to suffer from the outage problem in emergency motion change, which enhances the safety of the vehicular platooning. On the other hand, the smooth and well-organized platoon control provides the IoV system with lower CSIT estimation error and higher channel gain, which improves the spectral and energy efficiency of the V2X communication. Finally, the FEEL downlink benefits from this efficient RSMA-based IoV platoon system in terms of latency.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we design an IoV system to support the FEEL in vehicular platooning. In contrast to the conventional wireless communication systems, two major challenges should be met in the vehicular platoons: 1) the motion of the vehicles is highly dynamic, which leads to imperfect CSIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, 2) the FEEL and platoon control messages require both multicasting and unicasting. To tackle these problems, NOUM-enabled RSMA is considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. This RSMA scheme is specifically designed for the NOUM transmission scenario and is resilient to the imperfect CSIT in vehicular platooning. By relying on the RSMA, the platoon has less probability to suffer from the outage problem in emergency motion change <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which enhances the safety of the vehicular platooning.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed RSMA-based platoon system relies on jointly solving the FEEL problem and platoon control problem illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A IoV Platoon System ‣ III System Model ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. It is comprised of three major components, namely the FEEL system, the RSMA communication system, and the platoon control system. Each platoon is composed of a Lead Vehicle (LV) and a number of Follower Vehicles (FVs). Considering the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, e.g., the outage problem, the scale of a single platoon is less than 10 vehicles. All these vehicles shall support RSMA for V2X communication, i.e. equipped with 1-layer SIC and multiple antennas. The LV is responsible for the entire platoon’s behavioral decisions controlled by broadcasting its timely status and control information to the FVs via V2V communication. The FVs in the platoon are controlled by the LV for ensuring that they are traveling at the same speed, while maintaining a safe inter-vehicle distance. Since the FVs follow the LV and operate in a semi-autonomous control mode, these vehicles are capable of supporting additional services via their spare computing power, such as distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, it is unlikely that all vehicles are willing to upload their local data to the LV due to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, the FEEL system is proposed as a promising solution. In the system considered, each FV trains the individual local model relying on their local dataset, and then uploads the relevant information to the LV. Then, the LV updates the global model accordingly. After each iteration, the LV can download the global model to all the FVs. However, it is inefficient to transmit this global model via the unicast stream supporting the individual uploads to the LV. To address this issue, the NOUM-enabled RSMA concept is proposed. In this system, the FEEL model will be sent from the LV to the FVs via the super common message, and the platoon control results will be contained in private messages as well as common messages, which will be detailed as follows.</p>

We harness the MPC approach for efficiently solving the platoon control problem. The proposed MPC-based platoon control problem uses a receding horizon technique. Specifically, instead of solving the platoon control problem in its entirety, the optimization problem is partitioned into slices along the time horizon. In each short time horizon, the optimization problem is solved, and the first time step of the control input is implemented. This facilitates the online control of the platoon. We denote the number of time steps in each horizon by <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\zeta" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ζ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\zeta</annotation></semantics></math>, and then, the sub-problem (<a href="#S4.E21" title="In IV-A Block Coordinate Descent Framework ‣ IV RSMA-Based IoV Operation Framework ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a>) is reformulated as:</p>

Then, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the relevant baseline techniques, such as NOMA and MU-LP. Next, we assess the robustness of the proposed model. Then, we investigate the impact of different road conditions and their effect on our proposed system model. Finally, we analyze the convergence trends of the algorithms devised.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this simulation, we consider a pair of different road scenarios for verifying the effectiveness of our proposed IoV platoon control system, namely, the obstacle avoidance scenario (S1) and the crossroad zone scenario (S2). The case study consists of three V2V communication schemes: a) the NOUM-based RSMA, b) the NOUM-aided MU-LP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and c) the unicast NOMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The traffic environment of the obstacle avoidance scenario (S1) is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2a</span></a>. In S1, multiple vehicles are traveling together in a multi-lane platoon formation. In particular, an obstacle blocks the left and the central lanes. Once the obstacle is detected, the LV opts for reconfiguring the platoon to a single-lane formation confined to the right lane. Thus, all the vehicles in the left and the central lanes will move to the right lane. The vehicles in the right lane have to create sufficient space to facilitate the safe and smooth lane changing and merging of the vehicles originally traveling in the lane having the obstacle. The obstacle is modeled as a polytopic set, and some additional obstacle avoidance constraints are also imposed in this scenario.</p>

In S2, multiple vehicles are preparing to enter the crossroad zone. By following the practical traffic laws, these must perform the following actions: 1) all the vehicles should enter the straight lane in the center, and 2) lane changes are not allowed when entering the solid line area. Thus, the LV has to predetermine the distance of the crossroad zone and reconfigure the platoon into a single-lane configuration for shifting to the central lane. In this scenario, the additional traffic law constraints are also entered into the proposed platoon control model.</p>

Observe that, the proposed RSMA-based system generates a relatively modest variance of the profiles for all these four metrics. Then, the dynamic sum rate of the system is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3.sf6" title="In Figure 3 ‣ V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3f</span></a>. The RMSA scheme outperforms the other two conventional communication schemes. Moreover, the unicast NOMA achieves the lowest sum rate due to inefficient unicast communication. At the very beginning of the simulation, the broadcast message of the FEEL downlink occupies the communication channel. Thus, all these three communication schemes achieve a high sum rate until the FEEL downlink finishes. Then, only the unicast message is transmitted from the LV to the FVs, and the communication channel is under-loaded. This means that all these three schemes can meet the transmission rate requirement of the unicast message, and achieve the same sum rate. To summarize, the employment of RSMA can guarantee efficient and smooth IoV platoon control operations and improves the communication throughput in the proposed system.</p>

The loss value of the FEEL global model, in <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>, further confirms this result.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the setting of S1, we assess the robustness of the V2V communication module. We first compare the FEEL downlink latency for the different platoon sizes under perfect CSIT in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ V-D Robustness of V2V Communication under RSMA ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6a</span></a>. It is noted that unicast NOMA exhibits the highest latency, suggesting that it is inefficient to solely utilize the unicasting channel in this circumstance. Furthermore, the NOUM-enabled RSMA outperforms the MU-LP, because RSMA is more efficient in the over-loaded network. We also compare the latency of the FEEL downlink under different transmission powers in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ V-D Robustness of V2V Communication under RSMA ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6b</span></a>. Naturally, a higher transmission power leads to a higher transmission rate, and lower latency. RSMA can outperform the other two baselines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Then, we further assess the reliability of the V2V communication module. We also evaluate the efficacy of the RSMA scheme with perfect CSIT in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6.sf3" title="In Figure 6 ‣ V-D Robustness of V2V Communication under RSMA ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6c</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F6.sf4" title="In Figure 6 ‣ V-D Robustness of V2V Communication under RSMA ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6d</span></a>. The NOUM-based RSMA still outperforms the conventional MU-LP and NOMA schemes. Moreover, compared to this case in perfect CSIT, both the MU-LP and NOMA schemes consume more energy and have higher latency under imperfect CSIT. In the meantime, the latency gap among these three techniques becomes higher. This indicates that the NOUM-aided RSMA is more reliable than the other two schemes.</p>

Explicitly, Fig <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-E Impact of Different Road Conditions ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows the vehicles’ states and control inputs: (a) motion trajectories, (b) heading angle, (c) velocity, (d) acceleration, (e) steering angle, and (f) sum rate. Since the platoon system has to follow the traffic regulations, all the vehicles shall enter the straight lane before moving into the solid line area. In this case, the system should obey some additional constraints, in order to smoothly reconfigure the current platoon into a single-lane platoon. Furthermore, compared to the traffic behavior shown in S1, it is more challenging to make safe and smooth lane changes for the crossroad scenario. Nevertheless, our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IoV platoon under different road conditions. Moreover, we also compare the mean and the variance of the heading angle, velocity, acceleration, and steering angle of the vehicles. Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Robustness of V2V Communication under RSMA ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> shows the related results characterizing the NOUM-aided MU-LP and the unicast NOMA for the V2V communication module. Compared to S1, the vehicles dedicate more effort to steering control in S2, which leads to a higher vehicular heading and steering angle variance. In this case, the RSMA-aided IoV platoon control scheme can still outperform both baselines in terms of its variance. Hence, these results prove the superiority of the RSMA scheme, as well as the robustness of the proposed IoV platoon system.</p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we investigate the convergence of the proposed BCD framework, which is related to Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-A Block Coordinate Descent Framework ‣ IV RSMA-Based IoV Operation Framework ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Here, we study the proposed IoV platoon model under S1 supporting four cars, and mainly focus our attention on the Objective Function (OF) value of the optimization problem formulated in (<a href="#S3.E19" title="In III-E Multi-Objective Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">19</span></a>) and on the corresponding convergence gap. Explicitly, the convergence gap is derived based on the difference of the OF values obtained in every iteration, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-F Convergence of the Algorithms Devised ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. Specifically, we can observe that the OF value saturates after approximately 3 iterations. At this stage, the convergence gap falls within the tolerance threshold of the stopping criterion after approximately 3 iterations. This confirms that the proposed BCD framework is efficient in generating the near-optimal solutions of the RSMA-based communication problem formulated.</p>

These two problems are studied in the same settings as previously. For the SCA-based FEEL downlink problem, we focus on the OF value in (<a href="#S4.E30" title="In IV-B SCA-based FEEL downlink algorithm ‣ IV RSMA-Based IoV Operation Framework ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">30</span></a>) and on the related convergence gap in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-F Convergence of the Algorithms Devised ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. Specifically, we can observe that the OF value saturates after 4 iterations, while the convergence gap falls within the tolerance threshold after 4 iterations. This confirms that the proposed SCA-based FEEL downlink problem is efficiently solved, and near-optimal solutions can be found. Similarly, for the platoon control problem in Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-F Convergence of the Algorithms Devised ‣ V Case Studies ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, we study the convergence of the MPC approach by assessing the OF value of (<a href="#S4.E31" title="In IV-C MPC-Based Platoon Control ‣ IV RSMA-Based IoV Operation Framework ‣ Efficient Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for the Internet of Vehicles: Federated Edge Learning and Latency Minimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">31</span></a>) and the convergence gap. Specifically, we can observe that the OF value saturates after 5 iterations, and the convergence gap satisfies the stopping criterion after 5 iterations.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigated an RSMA-aided V2X downlink scenario in a vehicular platoon application. Specifically, an RSMA-based IoV solution was proposed for jointly considering two problems, namely, the IoV platoon control and FEEL downlink operations. The proposed framework was designed for minimizing both the latency of the FEEL downlink and the deviation of the vehicles’ trajectories within the platoon system. Given this sophisticated framework, a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated. To efficiently solve this problem, a BCD framework was developed for decoupling the main multi-objective problem into two sub-problems. Additionally, for solving these non-convex sub-problems, the classic SCA and MPC approaches were deployed for solving the FEEL-based downlink and platoon control problems, respectively. Our numerical results indicated that the proposed RSMA-based IoV system outperforms both the popular MU–LP and the conventional NOMA system in terms of the FEEL downlink latency and the control input variance. Furthermore, the BCD framework was shown to generate near-optimal solutions at reduced complexity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our future work, we will consider adopting the deep learning approach to estimate the channel information, since this work only considers the channel estimation through the known vehicle’s states. We will also explore how to incorporate perception-based concepts into the proposed system model in support of both the platoon control and the RSMA-based V2X system.</p>
