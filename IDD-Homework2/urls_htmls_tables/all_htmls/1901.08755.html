<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">The protection of user privacy is an important concern in machine learning, as evidenced by the rolling out of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) in May <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2018" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2018</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">2018</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">2018</annotation></semantics></math>. The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this paper, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned data set. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other non-federated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data and thus it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The modern society is increasingly concerned with the unlawful use and exploitation of personal data. At the individual level, improper use of personal data may cause potential risk to user privacy. At the enterprise level, data leakage may have grave consequences on commercial interests. Actions are being taken by different societies. For example, the European Union has enacted a law known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Many enterprise that rely heavily on machine learning are beginning to make sweeping changes as a consequence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite difficulty in meeting the goal of user privacy protection, the need for different organizations to collaborate while building machine learning models still stays strong. In reality, many data owners do not have sufficient amount of data to build high-quality models.
For example, retail companies have users’ purchases and transaction data, which are highly useful if provided to banks for credit rating applications. Likewise, mobile phone companies have users’ usage data, but each company may only have a small amount of users which are not enough to train high-quality user preference models. Such companies have strong motivation to collaboratively exploit the joint data value.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">So far, it is still a challenge to allow different data owners to collaboratively build high-quality machine learning models while at the same time protecting user data privacy and confidentiality. In the past, several attempts have been made to address the user privacy issue in machine learning  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For example, Apple proposed to use <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">differential privacy</span> (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to address the privacy preservation issue. The basic idea of DP is to add properly calibrated noise to data to disambiguate the identity of any individuals when data is being exchanged and analyzed by a third party. However, DP only prevents user-data leakage to a certain degree and cannot completely rule out the identity of an individual. In addition, data exchange under DP still requires that data change hands between organizations, which may not be allowed by strict laws like GDPR. Furthermore, the DP method is <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">lossy</span> in machine learning in that models built after noise is injected may perform unsatisfactorily in prediction accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">More recently, Google introduced a <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> (FL) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and deployed it on Android cloud. The basic idea is to allow individual clients to upload only model updates but not raw data to a central server where the models are aggregated. A secure aggregation protocol was further introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to ensure the model parameters do not leak user information to the server. This framework is also referred to as horizontal FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> or data-partition FL where each partition corresponds to a subset of data samples collected from one or multiple users.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider another setting of multiple parties collaboratively build their machine learning models while protecting user privacy and data confidentiality. Our setting is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ SecureBoost: A Lossless Federated Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and is typically referred as vertical FL <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite></span> because data are partitioned by features among different parties. This setting has a wide range of real-world applications. For example, financial institutes can leverage alternative data from a third party to enhance users’ and small and medium enterprises’ credit ratings <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite></span>. Patents’ record from multiple hospitals can be used together for diagnoses <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite></span>. We can regard the data located at different parties as a subsection of a virtual big data table obtained by taking the union of all data at different parties. Then the data at each party has the following property:
</p>
<ol id="S1.I1" class="ltx_enumerate">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The big data table is vertically split, such that the data are split in the feature dimension among parties;</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Only one data provider has the label information;</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Parties share a common set of users.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="S1.p5.2" class="ltx_p">Our goal is then to allow parties to build a prediction model jointly while protecting all parties from leaking data information to other parties. In contrast with most existing work on privacy-preserving data mining and machine learning, the complexity in our setting is significantly increased. Unlike sample-partitioned/horizontal FL, the vertical FL setting requires a more complex mechanism to decompose the loss function at each party <span id="S1.p5.2.1" class="ltx_text"> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite></span>. In addition, since only one data provider owns the label information, we need to propose a secure protocol to guide the learning process instead of sharing label information explicitly among all parties. Finally, data confidentiality and privacy concerns prevent parties from exposing their own users. Hence, entity alignment should also be conducted in a sufficiently secure manner.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method, which excels in many machine learning tasks due to its high efficiency as well as strong interpretability. For example, XGBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> has been widely used in various applications including credit risk analysis and user behavior studies. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end privacy-preserving tree-boosting algorithm and framework known as SecureBoost to enable machine learning in a federated setting. Secureboost has been implemented in an open-sourced FL project, FATE<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE</span></span></span> to enable industrial applications.
Our federated learning framework operates in two steps. First, we find the common users among the parties under a privacy-preserving constraint. Then, we collaboratively learn a shared classification or regression model without leaking any user information to each other. We summarize our main contributions as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To protect the privacy of the data used for learning a model, the authors in <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite></span> proposed to take advantage of differential privacy (DP) for learning a deep learning model. Recently, Google introduced a federated learning framework to prevent the data from being transmitted by bringing the model training to each mobile terminal <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite></span>. Its basic idea is that each local mobile terminal trains the local model using its local data with the same model architecture. The global model can simply be updated by averaging all the local models. Following the same idea, several attempts have been made to reinvent different machine learning models to the federated setting, including decision tree <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite></span>, linear/logistic regression <span id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite></span> and neural network <span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite></span>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All the above methods are designed for horizontally partitioned data. Unlike sample-partitioned/horizontal FL, the vertical FL setting requires a more complex mechanism to decompose the loss function at each party. The concept of vertical FL is first proposed in <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text"> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite></span> and protocols are proposed for linear models <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite></span> and neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Some previous works have been proposed for privacy-preserving decision trees over vertically partitioned data <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite></span>. However, their proposed methods have to reveal class distribution over given attributes, which will cause potential security risks. In addition, they can only handle discrete data, which is less practical for real-life scenarios. In contrast, our method guarantees better protection to the data and can be easily applied to continuous data. Another work proposed in <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite></span> jointly performs logistic regression over the encrypted vertically-partitioned data by approximating a non-linear logistic loss by a Taylor expansion, which will inevitably compromise the performance of the model.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, the gradient-tree boosting excels in many machine learning tasks, such as fraud detection, feature selection and product recommendation. In this section, we propose a novel gradient-tree boosting algorithm called SecureBoost in the federated learning setting. It consists of two major steps. First, it aligns the data under the privacy constraint. Second, it collaboratively learns a shared gradient-tree boosting model while keeping all the training data secret over multiple private parties. We explain each step below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our first goal is to find a common set of data samples at all participating parties so as to build a joint model <math id="S4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math>. When the data is vertically partitioned among parties, different parties hold different but partially overlapping users, which can be identified using their IDs. The problem is how to find the common data samples across the parties without revealing the non-shared parts. To achieve this goal, we align the data samples under a privacy-preserving protocol for inter-database intersections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After aligning the data across different parties under the privacy constraint, we now consider the problem of jointly building tree ensemble models over multiple parties without violating privacy. Before further discussing the detail of the algorithm, we first introduce the general framework of federated learning. In federated learning, a typical iteration consists of four steps. First, each client downloads the current global model from server. Second, each client computes an updated model based on its local data and the current global model, which resides within the active party. Third, each client sends the model update back to the server under encryption. Finally, the server aggregates these model updates and construct the updated global model.</p>

<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Following the general framework of federated learning, we see that to design a privacy-preserving tree boosting framework in the setting of federated learning, essentially we have to answer the following three questions: (1) How can each client (i.e., a passive party) compute an updated model based on its local data without reference to class label? (2) How can the server (i.e., the active party) aggregate all the updated model and obtain a new global model? (3) How to share the updated global model among all parties without leaking any information at inference time? To answer these three questions, we start by reviewing a tree ensemble model, XGBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, in a non-federated setting.</p>

In order to reduce information leakage with respect to <span id="S7.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">passive parties</span>, we opt to store decision tree leaves at the active party and propose a modified version of our framework, called <span id="S7.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Reduced-Leakage SecureBoost (RL-SecureBoost)</span>. With <span id="S7.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RL-SecureBoost</span>, the active party learns the first tree independently based only on its own features which fully protects the instance space of its leaves. Hence, all the information that passive parties learn is based on residuals. Although the residuals may also reveal information, we prove that as the purity in the first tree increases, this residual information decreased.</p>

We theoretically prove that our proposed framework is as accurate as non-federated gradient tree boosting counterparts. In addition, we analyze information leakage during the protocol execution and propose provable ways to reduce it.</p>
