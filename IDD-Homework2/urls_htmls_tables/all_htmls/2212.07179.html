<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has become a key choice for distributed machine learning. Initially focused on centralized aggregation, recent works in FL have emphasized greater decentralization to adapt to the highly heterogeneous network edge. Among these, Hierarchical, Device-to-Device and Gossip Federated Learning (HFL, D2DFL &amp; GFL respectively) can be considered as foundational FL algorithms employing fundamental aggregation strategies. A number of FL algorithms were subsequently proposed employing multiple fundamental aggregation schemes jointly. Existing research, however, subjects the FL algorithms to varied conditions and gauges the performance of these algorithms mainly against Federated Averaging (FedAvg) only. This work consolidates the FL landscape and offers an objective analysis of the major FL algorithms through a comprehensive cross-evaluation for a wide range of operating conditions. In addition to the three foundational FL algorithms, this work also analyzes six derived algorithms. To enable a uniform assessment, a multi-FL framework named FLAGS: <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>l<span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">G</span>orithms <span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>imulation has been developed for rapid configuration of multiple FL algorithms. Our experiments indicate that fully decentralized FL algorithms achieve comparable accuracy under multiple operating conditions, including asynchronous aggregation and the presence of stragglers. Furthermore, decentralized FL can also operate in noisy environments and with a comparably higher local update rate. However, the impact of extremely skewed data distributions on decentralized FL is much more adverse than on centralized variants. The results indicate that it may not be necessary to restrict the devices to a single FL algorithm; rather, multi-FL nodes may operate with greater efficiency.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The critical challenges associated with centralization in Machine Learning (ML), including data aggregation, privacy and security risks, and economy of resources have accelerated interest in decentralized learning approaches. Federated Learning (FL) is one such learning framework that enables disjoint devices to learn collaboratively without the need to share data. The process entails devices to train models locally and share them for aggregation. Since its inception by Google researchers, Federated Learning (FL) proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as FedAvg has been the foremost avenue for distributed Deep Learning (DL). Gboard-Google keyboard and Siri-Apple smart assistant, are real-world applications that have benefited tremendously from FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While FL is a major avenue towards democratized learning, there still exists a strong proclivity in FL research towards centralized orchestration. Access to updates from a large number of devices, a global model, considerable computational and storage resources have traditionally made a strong case for Centralized FL (FedAvg). However, there exist a number of challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to such an operation including adversarial attacks, malicious participation, privacy preservation, heterogeneous devices and participation, non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, and communication issues. Simultaneously, next generation networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> envision considerable serverless interaction between the devices. Advances, such as application specific data rates, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and network slicing have enabled researchers to propose various FL algorithms based on the permissible device interactions
(see Fig.<a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Existing Frameworks ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for the depiction of these links). The proposed methods under various settings show multiple advantages over Centralized FL (FedAvg). Furthermore, current and future devices come equipped with multiple communication links. This fact negates the limitation of operating a single FL algorithm at all times. The challenge then arises regarding the selection of FL algorithm to employ under various conditions. The comparative characterization of FL algorithms conducted in this work is aimed at bridging this gap.
The analysis conducted here paves the way
for establishing economy of operation for these algorithms for various operating scenarios in a particularly heterogeneous Network Edge.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the current research in Federated Learning leans heavily towards centralization. However, research indicates that careful selection of design parameters may yield competitive results for decentralized FL as well. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> describes a fully decentralized FL algorithm with IID data distributed across users interacting according to a directed graph. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors present a gossip-aggregation framework for FL. The research reports more favorable results from gossip learning based FL with uniform data distribution across the nodes. More recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> suggests the application of the Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DSGD</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> for D2D belief aggregation in the presence of wireless impairments. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes a Consensus-based Federated Averaging (CFA) for dense IoT networks. Their analysis suggests that serverless cooperation between devices may also yields results comparable to FedAvg. Extending their work, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> evaluate Consensus-based Federated Averaging (CFA) and CFA-Gradient Exchange (CFA-GE) for dense IoT networks with D2D interaction. Their results support the original hypothesis indicating that although slow to converge, CFA and CFA-GE achieve performance similar to FedAvg with communication restricted only to device level. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors try to tackle the problem of data heterogeneity in a decentralized fit learning setting. The authors propose a peer-to-peer model exchange method with model fusion using Mutual Knowledge Transfer.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Other research has also proposed hybrid FL algorithms employing hierarchical aggregation in conjunction with D2D interaction.

Their suggested method in conjunction with a cosine-similarity based device filtering attains higher convergence speeds using less number of local updates. Then <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> experiment with FL using clustered devices where the Cluster Heads, selected from the devices, are awarded reputation scores by the members and may communicate with their one-hop neighbors. The results indicate that the proposed configuration improves network efficiency.</p>

This research evaluates the learning techniques for increasing client population as well as increasing the size of the global dataset. The results indicate that split learning favors the former whereas the latter is better served by FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors compare FedAvg, Federated Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (FSVRG) and CO-OP FL algorithms to investigate the impact of non-IID distribution of various FL optimization techniques. However, the comparison only considers centralized FL aggregation for the mentioned optimization schemes. The results indicate that FedAvg fares better than the other two techniques for non-IID data distribution. A detailed empirical analysis of federated and gossip learning conducted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> shows that gossip performs competitively with federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Benchmarking FL takes on greater significance as the envisioned operating environment is highly diverse and different from centralized or silo-based distributed learning. It is therefore necessary that an effective benchmark be capable of allowing heterogeneity in device behavior, data distribution and connectivity. Additionally, the benchmark should be able to support different cooperation schemes that form the basis of different FL algorithms.</p>

The framework allows each network entity, whether a node or a server, to separately emulate a realistic behavior. By implementing a range of functionality associated with each entity, this framework allows diverse network interactions enabling multiple FL algorithms to be simulated easily. Each device has a wide array of associated functions to enable multiple operating conditions and device behaviors. During the experiments, the FL algorithms are subjected to some of the key challenges facing general FL research. The empirical analysis of the performance of these FL algorithms is conducted by varying the operating parameters such as device participation, communication noise and data distribution.</p>

The server is also required to share the aggregated model with the connected nodes for the subsequent rounds adding to the overall communication volume needed to execute FL successfully. Such servers are typically located at the network cloud level, offering multiple services. Thus, frequent communication to and from these servers becomes an extremely expensive operation in addition to straining the latency requirements of various edge services in addition to subjecting the shared models to additional adversarial risks.Table  reftab:params presents the list of parameters used in this work.</p>

The Device Aggregation flags control whether a node is allowed to share information with its peers or not. This may be within the devices’ own neighborhoods or through random pairings including multi-hop interactions. The Edge Aggregation, when enabled, enables the devices to share their local models with the hierarchical servers. Cluster and Inter-Cluster Aggregations have been included in the framework to support expandability for FL scenarios with device clusters.
Employing a flag-based mechanism allows the framework to remain configurable for addition of more FL algorithms.The <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">flag</span> settings for the various FL algorithms covered within this work have been shared under Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 FLAGS Architecture ‣ 4 FLAGS Framework ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning was initially conceived as a two-tiered learning framework alternating between clients/nodes performing the training and the cloud servers aggregating the local models to yield a global model. In order to increase the efficiency, the envisaged FL was further spread over the Edge Network to benefit not only from the Edge devices capabilities but also address the challenges inherent with centralization. This evolution has yielded various FL algorithms suitable to a variety of scenarios including vehicular-networks, dense IoT networks, cross-silo operations between relatively large data centers. These algorithms employ three different types of communication links as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Existing Frameworks ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> associated with different communication costs:

While D2D links and D2E links operate independently, E2C links require the latter for information to be transmitted from the devices to the edge server for onward transmission to the core network. All subsequent communication analyses in this work use this fact to establish effectiveness of a particular form of communication in FL operations.</p>

In this regard, the devices ability to interact within its neighborhood and subsequent consolidation at Cluster Head (CH) results in a greater participation in the overall aggregation scheme. In order to further expand this functionality, this algorithm allows the Cluster Heads to communicate the other CH’s using a gossip mechanism. While the rest of the learning and aggregation process remains similar to CD2DFL, the aggregation at the cluster head level is followed by the CH exchanging the locally aggregated cluster model <math id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{\theta}_{\mathcal{C}_{i}}^{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝜽</mi><msub id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">𝒞</mi><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝜽</ci><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">𝒞</ci><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS8.p1.1.m1.1c">\bm{\theta}_{\mathcal{C}_{i}}^{t}</annotation></semantics></math> with other CH <math id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{\mathcal{C}_{j}|i\neq j\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml">{</mo><msub id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒞</mi><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">j</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml">|</mo><mrow id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.1" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.1.cmml">≠</mo><mi id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.3.cmml">j</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.5" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3">conditional-set</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2">𝒞</ci><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3">𝑗</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2"><neq id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.1"></neq><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci><ci id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.3">𝑗</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS8.p1.2.m2.2c">\{\mathcal{C}_{j}|i\neq j\}</annotation></semantics></math> using randomized gossip.

<div id="S5.SS9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FedAvg is on the centralized end of the FL algorithms spectrum whereas GFL, D2DFL and CD2DFL are on the decentralized end. HFL, HD2DFL and HGFL avail a mix of centralized and decentralized operations. iCFL and iCD2DFL, despite being fully decentralized, mimic hierarchical behavior at the device level. The boundaries between centralized and decentralized operations FL algorithms thus remain fluid allowing present and future algorithms to benefit from both types of interactions.</p>

<p id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One-Shot FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> suggests training local models to completion before sharing with the global server. The resulting mechanism enables significant reduction in communication frequency. Extending the idea, this work subjects the FL algorithms to Few-Shot FL. The nodes perform significantly more local updates before sharing their models. The scheme works with significantly reduced aggregation rounds and communication at both device and edge level. However, it also results in higher client drift.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Asynchronous Operation</h4>

<div id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL envisions autonomy of operation at the device level. By extension, this implies that not all of the devices perform same number of update operations during the training phase. This may be caused by device being active (or inactive) or a straggler. This work assumes that the devices are required to work with a deadline after which they are required to share their respective models for aggregation. This deadline-based asynchronous aggregation behavior is replicated for the FL algorithms by allowing each device to undergo a range-limited random number of training epochs.</p>

As expected, greater non-IID distribution across device adversely affects the convergence rate and performance. The impact is reflected across all algorithms. However, results for FashionMNIST depict more loss in performance. This indicates a strong correlation between the performance degradation jointly due to a DNN’s ability to learn and greater non-IID levels. The results in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Asynchronous Operation ‣ 6 Experiments and Evaluation ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> indicate that decentralized FL performs on par with their more centralized counterparts. The results also show that as distributions become more non-IID, GFL, D2DFL and CD2DFL lag in learning performance when compared to the other algorithms. However, GFL also incurs the least communication volume among all the considered FL schemes since it only uses the least costly communication link as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.4 Few Shot Learning ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. 
<br class="ltx_break">The decentralized algorithms also indicate a slightly slower convergence rate exacerbated as the training progresses. However, clustered operations, particularly iCD2DFL and iCFL indicate better convergence and consistently perform better than D2DFL and GFL. This indicates that inter-cluster cooperation orchestrated by these algorithms helps in the learning performance and may help in arresting overtraining even in the absence of global information. This is particularly evident from iCFL where D2D interaction at the device level is absent.</p>

Less number of devices joining an aggregation round may be caused due to stragglers or busy devices. All the algorithms suffer from convergence issues as the device participation is decreased. This implies that data distribution and device participation have confounding effects on the learning performance of these algorithms. The difference in performance of the D2DFL, GFL and CD2DFL becomes more pronounced than the rest as the training proceeds. The performance suffers clearly from overtraining compounded by lower number of devices as well highly non-IID data. The convergence rate of these three algorithms slows more evidently than the others as the training proceeds. On the other hand, inter-cluster operations allow iCFL and iCD2DF to perform better than the others even with 60% device participation.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results from Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> are reinforced by testing the FL algorithms under limited device participation and extremely skewed data distribution as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. When subjected to 2-class and 3-class non-IID data distributions, the localized operation in D2DFL, GFL and CD2DFL suffers more than the others. Lesser number of classes result in almost 20% performance difference between these algorithms and the rest as indicated in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(a) and (c). The performance of iCFL and iCD2DFL, however, remains remarkably robust even in the presence of these extremely adverse conditions. Both algorithms, supported by inter-CH operation, perform within 5% of the centralized and hierarchical algorithms. The convergence rate of these algorithms retains its trajectory while other decentralized algorithms show greater divergence as the training proceeds. It may therefore be inferred that gossip operations by the CHs partially offset the degradation caused by the lesser device participation and extremely non-IID data and acts akin to DropOut operations in a DNN.

ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (c)-(d). The additional difference in performance can be attributed to greater non-IIDness in figures (c) and (d). The impact of client drift on all algorithms causing the learning to plateau earlier than regular learning regime is evident when its results are compared with the ones shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Asynchronous Operation ‣ 6 Experiments and Evaluation ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>-<a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Overall, the decentralized variants are impacted worse than the centralized and hierarchical algorithms. Additionally, the performance of D2DFL, GFL and CD2DFL lags further than the rest as training progresses. The performance of iCFL and CD2DFL while showing relatively bigger drop than when subjected to normal training scheme, still achieves an accuracy within 5% of the centralized algorithms. The overall performance suggests scenarios where Few-Shot learning may be considered practicable when communication costs become prohibitive especially or shared updates are infrequent.</p>

<p id="S7.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When dealing with different FL algorithms, it is essential that the difference between links employed during the operation is kept in purview. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> suggest that D2D links like LTE-Direct, WiFi Direct or DSRC are more energy efficient than Device-Edge cellular links like LTE. Furthermore, the same research also indicates that the mentioned D2D links offer reduced latency when compared with cellular communication. E2C links must be be preceded by D2E links for any communication meant for the cloud. It may therefore be inferred that the energy cost and latency of uploading to the cloud may well be more than both D2D and D2E communications. It is with this understanding that Fig.<a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.4 Few Shot Learning ‣ 7 Performance Analysis ‣ FLAGS Framework for Comparative Analysis of Federated Learning Algorithms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> considers D2D links as least costly and E2C links as most expensive both in terms of energy and latency.</p>

This is calculated by identifying the number of aggregation rounds required by each of the FL algorithms and are categorized according to the target level (device, edge or cloud). The centralized variants employ more expensive cellular communication for D2E communication. The additional load on network backbone in form of E2C links is bound to significantly increase the cost for FL albeit its improved performance.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work presents a comprehensive comparison of various FL algorithms that have so far been viewed only from the perspective of Centralized FL. The FLAGS framework developed for this purpose enables configuring multiple FL architectures expeditiously. The contrasting highlight of this work is a detailed comparison of major FL algorithms under some of the most dominant challenges in this domain. frameworks.
The analysis conducted here indicates that decentralized FL performs comparatively well despite no or minimal upstream communication. Even though noisy communication and irregular participation negatively impacts decentralized FL performance, such modes are still capable of achieving acceptable performance thresholds. However, extremely skewed data distributions degrade fully decentralized FL considerably more than centralized ones. The results indicate that FL modes may be used interchangeably depending on the network conditions and the communication costs. As part of the future work, we also intend to investigate the performance of the FL algorithms for feature skewed non-IID distributions. Furthermore, based on the results presented here, the next milestone would be to formulate an adaptive mechanism based on the operating and environment characteristics where the nodes may be suggested to follow a particular FL algorithm for efficient operation.</p>
