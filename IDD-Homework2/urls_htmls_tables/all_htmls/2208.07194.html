<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Since the traffic conditions change over time, machine learning models that predict traffic flows must be updated continuously and efficiently in smart public transportation.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning scheme that allows buses to receive model updates without waiting for model training on the cloud.
However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning or DDoS attacks since buses travel in public.
Some work introduces blockchain to improve reliability, but the additional latency from the consensus process reduces the efficiency of FL.
Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) is a scheme that reduces the latency of aggregation to improve efficiency, but the learning performance is unstable due to unreasonably weighted local models.
To address the above challenges, this paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor (DBAFL).
Specifically, the novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves reliability at the lowest possible cost of time.
Meanwhile, the devised dynamic scaling factor allows AFL to assign reasonable weights to stale local models.
Extensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate outperformed learning performance, efficiency, and reliability of DBAFL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) is a popular approach on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to enable smart public transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
For example, buses with ML models are able to forecast traffic flows and the time passengers wait at stops, assisting drivers in improving driving safety and fuel economy. However, because traffic conditions change over time, ML models must be updated continuously and efficiently.
Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed ML scheme that allows models to be trained locally and updated frequently.
For instance, buses collect traffic data and train local models, while roadside units (RSUs) periodically aggregate the local models to produce an accurate global model and send it back to the buses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL raises efficiency and reliability concerns due to the limited computing resources and continuous movement of buses in smart public transportation. Firstly, the synchronous aggregation strategy forces the aggregation server to collect enough local models before aggregation, which is inefficient due to the difference of computing power and dataset sizes among buses and RSUs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Specifically, high-performance nodes have to wait for lagging nodes to finish their training before aggregation. Secondly, unreliable local models gathered from buses pose FL at risk of poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The centralized aggregation server of FL is subject to DDoS attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Both of these attacks reduce the reliability of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the efficiency of FL, asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is proposed, which reduces the latency by performing aggregation whenever a local model is received <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, due to the high aggregation frequency, there are outdated global models in AFL, from which stale local models trained usually have relatively low accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Existing work either discards or assigns irrational weights to stale local models, leading to unstable FL learning performance (i.e. convergence speed and global model accuracy) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Some work adopts blockchain to improve the reliability of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Due to its decentralized storage and attack-proof consensus algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, blockchain allows FL to conduct a decentralized and transparent training process, resulting in improved security and trustability. However, consensus algorithms of the blockchain are either compute-intensive (i.g. PoW) or communication-intensive (i.g. PBFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To improve efficiency, committee-based consensus algorithms such as DPoS are proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, but their token or reputation systems are unsuitable for buses that pass quickly. Although several blockchain-based AFL schemes are proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, their consensus processes are still time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the above challenges and better apply FL into smart public transportation systems, this paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning framework with a dynamic scaling factor (DBAFL). A novel committee-based consensus algorithm is introduced to improve reliability while bringing the least amount of communication burden. Specifically, the committee leader, as the aggregation server, identifies low-accuracy local models based on its local dataset to resist poisoning attacks. Without the need for communication and voting, a new committee leader is elected from RSUs periodically based on the hash of the latest block to reduce the risk of being subjected to DDoS attacks. Besides, when performing aggregation, a dynamic scaling factor is designed to assign appropriate weights to local models according to their accuracy and correspondingly improves the learning performance of FL. Experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices evaluate the proposed scheme and demonstrate its outstanding learning performance, efficiency, and reliability.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The public transportation system includes buses and RSUs on a road, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A System Model ‣ III DBAFL Modeling ‣ An Efficient and Reliable Asynchronous Federated Learning Scheme for Smart Public Transportation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The bus stop equipped with sensors and an edge computing server is considered a kind of RSU in this scenario. RSUs usually have higher computing and communication power than buses. Buses establish short-term Vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) connections with nearby RSUs or buses when they are within a signal region, allowing them to transmit a certain amount of data. Besides, RSUs have a high-speed Ethernet connection with each other to support smart public transportation.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Buses and RSUs train ML models collaboratively to predict traffic flows and the time passengers wait at stops, allowing buses to travel safely and efficiently. Since traffic conditions change over time, buses and RSUs continuously collect training dataset through their sensors to update models. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, in an area, the traffic data collected on buses and RSUs are assumed independent and identically distributed (IID). However, the training time and model quality of buses and RSUs differ due to differences in computing power and dataset sizes, posing learning performance challenges to FL. The limited connect time and bandwidth of V2R and V2V connections pose efficiency challenges to FL. The poisoning and DDoS attacks launched by attackers on the roadside pose reliability challenges to FL.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In DBAFL, a dynamic scaling factor and a lightweight consensus algorithm are designed on top of AFL and the blockchain to improve learning performance, efficiency, and reliability. Specifically, buses and RSUs act as local nodes of FL and train local models based on their local data. After training, local nodes upload the hash value of the local model to the blockchain for other nodes to verify. Apart from that, buses upload the local model to nearby RSUs for global model aggregation. During the aggregation, the dynamic scaling factor assigns weights to local models according to their accuracy. RSUs are committee members and are eligible to be elected as the committee leader by the consensus algorithm. The identity of the next committee leader is determined by the hash of the most recent block, which does not require voting or communication. The committee maintains a distributed database with data synchronization to share models. The committee leader is in charge of performing aggregation whenever a new local model is received.</p>

If a stale local model has low accuracy due to the limited computing resources of the node, relying too much on this particular local model results in a deterioration of global model accuracy. On the contrary, if the stale local model has relatively high accuracy due to large volumes of data on the node, it is preferential to make better use of it to improve the convergence speed of the global model.</p>

The qualitative comparison takes energy efficiency, decentralization, scalability, and the support of ML model evaluation into account, as all of these criteria are important for applying FL to public transportation systems. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, PoW is energy-consuming, which is inappropriate for resource-limited vehicles. When evaluating from the aspects of governance, permission, and trust, PoS and DPoS have a relatively low decentralization level, which is more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than other consensus algorithms. By contrast, the proposed scheme is permissioned and trustable for buses and allows random RSUs to govern the transactions, which is more decentralized. PBFT has low scalability, which is not suitable for dynamic mobile networks. Although DAG and Algorand are energy-efficient, decentralized, and scalable, they do not support the model evaluation, as they are designed for cryptocurrency. Without model evaluation, the poisoned local models may degrade the performance of the global model. The proposed consensus algorithm is energy-efficient, decentralized, and scalable due to the hash-based committee leader election. The received local models are also evaluated by the committee leader using its local test dataset. By comparison, the proposed committee-based consensus algorithm is the most suitable one to support FL in the public transportation scenario.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The benefits of uploading models to the blockchain instead of a centralized aggregation server are as follows: i) The consistency and reliability of global models are guaranteed since the data in the blockchain is immutable; ii) The training process becomes transparent and auditable, preventing nodes from doing evil; iii) Buses become trustable due to the existence of the consensus algorithm.
Time efficiency is critical for smart public transportation systems, especially when training updated ML models for traffic condition prediction or driver assistance. Since the blockchain is resource-intensive, local nodes in DBAFL only upload the hash values of the models to the blockchain. The aforementioned benefits are preserved, as the model history is still traceable by the hash values in the blockchain and the original models are downloadable and verifiable by all local nodes. Furthermore, this mechanism greatly reduces the storage redundancy in the blockchain as well as the storage requirements for buses.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The design of DBAFL is primarily resistant to poisoning and DDoS attacks. When launching poisoning attacks, the attackers manipulate the parameters of local models and upload them to the global model, causing the accuracy of the global model to decrease <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, the committee leader is able to identify the malicious local models by testing their accuracy locally. As a result, the committee leader will assign them relative low weight, which defends poisoning attacks to a certain extent. Since the committee-based consensus algorithm periodically elects a new leader based on the hash value of the latest block, the accuracy test result is ensured to be reliable and unbiased. In addition, DBAFL introduces a stricter defense strategy that discards local models with an accuracy below a specific threshold to further reduce the influence of malicious local models. DDoS attacks primarily aim to disrupt the centralized aggregation server in traditional FL schemes by flooding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. In DBAFL, the periodically changed committee leader replaces the centralized aggregation server in classic FL, reducing the probability of being targeted by traffic flooding in DDoS attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A more frequent committee leader election leads to the increased reliability of DBAFL and the higher generality of the global model. However, it is almost impossible to guarantee efficiency if the committee leader is elected too frequently. Considering the mobile network is unstable, the network latency is likely to result in committee leader identities inconsistent and forks in the blockchain during block propagation. Aside from that, block size has an impact on efficiency as well. The decreased block size enables more frequent committee leader elections, which results in more blocks propagated in the blockchain and additional network overhead.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Buses may fall offline unexpectedly in an unstable mobile network. As a comparison, RSUs equipping with backup for disaster recovery are more stable. Therefore, only RSUs are committee members and eligible to be the committee leader, ensuring a stable global model aggregation process. A bus that falls offline unexpectedly will not affect the training process on other nodes in DBAFL due to its asynchronous aggregation strategy.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Assume buses are traveling on a road in a built-up area, where the 5G network coverage of an RSU is 300 meters and the vehicle speed limit is 60 km/h <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. By calculating, the connection of a running bus to an RSU lasts 18 seconds at most. Due to the device heterogeneity, it is hard to determine how long it will take a bus to finish training a local model. In DBAFL, the training of local models is independent for each bus due to the asynchronous aggregation strategy, which means that no network connection or waiting for others is required during the training process. After training, buses need to upload the local model to the nearby RSU and the hash value to the blockchain before downloading a new global model from the nearby RSU. As evaluated in Section <a href="#S5.SS2.SSS2" title="V-B2 RQ2. Time Costs ‣ V-B Results Analysis ‣ V System Evaluation ‣ An Efficient and Reliable Asynchronous Federated Learning Scheme for Smart Public Transportation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span>2</span></a>, the communication time cost in each training round of DBAFL is always less than 5 seconds, which is much less than the limitation of 18 seconds. After receiving the local model, the committee leader performs aggregation locally and generates a new global model, which is shared with other RSUs without effects from the mobility of buses. Besides, the leader election among committee members (RSUs) is also not affected by the mobility of buses. Therefore, considering the mobility of buses, DBAFL is still feasible in smart public transportation systems.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.5" class="ltx_p">Compared with classic FL, DBAFL has an additional communication complexity of uploading hash of models to the blockchain and electing new committee leaders. As the hash values are small enough without effects of the model size, it is easy to be packed into blocks and broadcast to nodes through the P2P protocol. Since the identity of the new committee leader is determined by the hash value of the specific block, no more network communication is required after the block is broadcasted to local nodes in IoV networks.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Five virtual machines (VM) and four Raspberry PI B4 devices are set up as the experiment environment. Each VM has 8 CPU cores and 8GB RAM to simulate an RSU. Each Raspberry PI B4 has 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM to simulate a vehicle with limited computing resources. In terms of software configuration, the Ubuntu 20.10 operating system is deployed on all nodes. ML models are trained with PyTorch v1.8.1 based on Python 3.8. The smart contract is developed on Hyperledger Fabric v2.3.0, an open-source blockchain framework, to orchestrate model training and aggregation on nodes and accept model hash values. Specifically, the smart contract is in charge of reading and writing the uploaded hash of models on the blockchain. Besides, whenever a new global model is generated (the hash of the new global model is received), the smart contract drives each node to download the latest global model from the committee leader for the next round of training. A RESTful service is developed on Express.js v4.17.1, allowing local nodes to upload or download the hash values of models from the blockchain. The implementation details are available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xuchenhao001/AFL" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/xuchenhao001/AFL</a>.</p>

APFL has the highest average time cost on training (almost twice the time than for the other schemes) due to two training procedures in each training round. In terms of the test stage, it is obvious that all schemes spend very little time (less than <math id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.3" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0.3</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1.1">0.3</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.2.m2.1c">0.3</annotation></semantics></math> seconds), implying that the additional accuracy-test stage in DBAFL has a negligible impact on the efficiency of AFL. In terms of the communication stage, the average time cost of DBAFL, BSFL, and BDFL is slightly higher than that of FedAVG, APFL, and Local Training due to the consensus process of the blockchain. However, DBAFL has a minimal time cost in waiting for other nodes, which is similar to ASOFED, BDFL, and Local Training, due to its asynchronous aggregation strategy. On the other hand, BSFL, APFL, and FedAVG waste nearly half of the time in a round waiting instead of training or communicating, resulting in lower training efficiency when compared with DBAFL.

As the number of nodes in the network increases, high-performance nodes have to wait for more lagging nodes in each training round when adopting synchronous aggregation strategies, implying a longer waiting time. As a result, the schemes utilizing asynchronous aggregation strategies (DBAFL, ASOFED, BDFL, and APFL) have better scalability than those adopting synchronous aggregation strategies (BSFL and FedAVG). Besides, even with the blockchain incorporated, DBAFL achieves the same scalability as the pure AFL scheme ASOFED and has higher scalability than other blockchain-based schemes, due to the adoption of the proposed efficient consensus algorithm.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor, aiming to address the challenges faced by FL on IoV networks in terms of learning performance, efficiency, and reliability.
The novel committee-based consensus algorithm in blockchain ensures the reliability of DBAFL with the least cost in communication latency.
In conjunction with the efficient asynchronous aggregation strategy, the dynamic scaling factor assigns reasonable weights to stale local models and improves learning performance for DBAFL.
Extensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate the advantages of DBAFL in learning performance, efficiency, and reliability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Future work includes recovering models when nodes go offline unexpectedly, applying DBAFL on non-independent and -identically distributed (Non-IID) datasets, and designing effective strategies to resist other attacks.</p>
