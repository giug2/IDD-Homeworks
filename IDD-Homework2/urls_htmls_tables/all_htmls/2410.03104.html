<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">Site-specific wireless channel simulations via ray tracers can be used to effectively study wireless, decreasing the need for extensive site-specific radio propagation measurements. To ensure that ray tracer simulations faithfully reproduce wireless channels, calibration of simulation results against real-world measurements is required. In this study we introduce NYURay, a 3D ray tracer specifically tailored for mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. To reliably generate site-specific wireless channel parameters, NYURay is calibrated using radio propagation measurements conducted at 28, 73, and 142 GHz in diverse scenarios such as outdoor areas, indoor offices, and factories.</p>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.id2">Traditional ray tracing calibration assumes angle-dependent reflection, requiring slow iterative optimization techniques with no closed form solution. We propose a simpler and quicker novel calibration method that assumes angle-independent reflection. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration approach is demonstrated using NYURay. When comparing the directional multipath power predicted by NYURay to the actual measured power, the standard deviation in error was less than 3 dB in indoor office environments and less than 2 dB in outdoor and factory environments. The root mean square (RMS) delay spread and angular spread was underpredicted by NYURay due to incomplete environmental maps available for calibration, however an overall agreement between the measured and simulated values was observed. These results highlight the high level of accuracy NYURay provides in generating the site-specific real-world wireless channel, that could be used to generate synthetic data for machine learning.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">A wide range of new applications, including centimeter-level position location, high-resolution virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), industrial automation, environment monitoring, and imaging, will be made possible by the enormous spectrum at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. Significant efforts have been made to characterize the wireless channel in order to assess the viability of such applications. Moreover, for the purpose of creating accurate channel models, several channel measurements have been conducted at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> in different environments at different frequency bands. However, real-world channel measurements are extremely time consuming, with typical measurement campaigns only gathering a handful of locations per environment. Furthermore, because of the sophisticated hardware needed, performing wireless channel measurements is frequently cost prohibitive. Thus, if there is an assurance that signal characteristics of predicted wireless channels, such as the powers, angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD), and time of flight (ToF) of signals arriving at wireless receivers closely match the true measured signal characteristics at given locations, site-specific simulation-based prediction of wireless channels can supplement actual measurements.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Based on the position of the wireless transmitter (TX), receiver (RX), and environmental obstacles ray tracing is a potent tool that may be utilized in predicting the signal propagation characteristics of wireless signals. When a signal is propagating, obstructions in the environment could cause reflections, transmissions, diffraction, or scattering. The ray tracer makes predictions about the wireless signals’ strength, AoA, AoD, and ToF, which can be used to recreate the spatial and temporal properties of the wireless channel for simulation-based study. Furthermore, ray tracing can be used to generate synthetic data to train machine learning algorithms and to evaluate sensing applications such as position localization and seeing through walls. At locations in a particular environment where the channel measurements were not made, artificial data can be produced to assess how well the sensing algorithms are performing. Ray tracers can offer precise ToF data that sensing algorithms need but may not have gathered during wireless channel measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Although ray tracing as discussed in this paper focuses on applications for wireless communications, ray tracing originated in computer graphics, wherein the lighting of a scene is predicted, i.e., the reflections, refraction, diffraction, and scattering of visible light originating from a light source in an environment is predicted.
In contrast, ray tracing in the context of wireless communications has been used for optimal TX placement for indoor wireless systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> to maximize signal coverage in the environment and minimize the bit error rate (BER). Additionally, ray tracing has been used to simulate the performance of applications such as position location <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">However, using a ray tracer for wireless simulations “out of the box” could result in inaccurate predictions of the wireless channel because the predicted arriving signal levels for a specific TX-RX pair may differ from the signals that would have been measured with the channel sounder at the same TX-RX location. For instance, an overestimation of the channel capacity could result from a ray tracer that predicts increased spatial diversity in the wireless channel. If employed for network planning, inaccurate power predictions made by the ray tracer could result in suboptimal base station placement that would cause signal outages in certain areas. For ray tracer-assisted simulations, accurate reproduction of the site-specific wireless channel requires proper calibration of the ray tracer.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p5.1">This paper is organized as follows. Section I presents an overview of the calibration techniques used for calibrating ray tracer for wireless communication. The popularly used techniques for wireless ray tracing, their computational complexity and the hybrid ray tracing technique adopted in NYURay is introduced in section II. In Section III, we present the theoretical propagation models used by NYURay, a 3-D mmWave and sub-THz ray tracer developed at NYU WIRELESS, to simulate reflection, penetration and scattering of wireless signals for site-specific wireless channel prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. Additionally, in Section IV a detailed insight is provided about the measurement campaigns and the channel sounder used in these measurement campaigns to conduct channel measurements at 28, 73 and 142 GHz in outdoor, indoor and factory scenarios. Furthermore, Section V describes how NYURay is used to analyze the channel measurements. Moreover, in Section VI a description of the procedure that can be used to calibrate NYURay to directional channel measurements conducted in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments at 28, 73, and 142 GHz is provided (over a total of nine different measurement campaigns).
In Section VII, we present a comprehensive analysis that compares the power, RMS angular spread, and RMS delay spread at 28, 73, and 142 GHz for outdoor, indoor, and factory scenarios using the channel measurements and the predictions obtained through NYURay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">mmWave ray tracers have been created by a variety of research organizations and companies for use in environments that are indoors as well as outdoor. Channel statistics like path loss, RMS angular spread, and RMS delay spread are frequently used for comparison in order to assess the performance of mmWave ray tracers. Within an Urban Microcell (UMi) environment at 28 GHz, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite> examined the measured and estimated omnidirectional path loss across various LOS and NLOS conditions. Moreover, in order to reduce the error in route loss prediction in an indoor office environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite> and an outdoor UMi environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite> at 28 GHz, researchers fine-tuned a single parameter of the relative permittivity of materials in the environment. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>, the authors linearly interpolated the dielectric constant of concrete at 5.2 GHz and 60 GHz, to obtain the electrical characteristics of concrete at 28 GHz. The authors assumed all buildings were made of concrete <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. An empirical ray tracing model was used in simulations at 73 GHz in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, wherein the reflection loss varied linearly with incident angle. The measured and simulated RMS angular and RMS delay spreads were compared in urban street canyon and UMi environments at 28 GHz and 73 GHz in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite> respectively. The path loss exponent (PLE), obtained via least squares estimation across multiple TX-RX locations was also compared in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, however the difference in path loss at individual TX-RX locations was not compared. Additionally, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>, the power-angular-delay profiles of a huge unoccupied room and a tiny workplace at 29 GHz (for a single TX-RX site pair in both situations) were compared. The ray tracer’s ability to forecast the dominating specular pathways was demonstrated, but a quantitative analysis of the differences between the measured channel and the simulated channel was omitted. At 60 GHz in an interior office space, the route gains of various multipath components were contrasted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. The direct comparison of simulated directional power to measured directional power, for example, is a more precise comparison that is rarely made.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">Changes in the direction of propagation and the energy carried by the signal occur as a result of objects in the environment interacting with signals as the signal propagates through the wireless medium. Reflection and transmission are the predominant modes of propagation at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. Diffused scattering also contributes significantly to propagation in areas where specular reflections from the TX are inhibited. However, in the presence of specular reflections, the power carried by scattering waves at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies is negligible (as much as 30 dB lower than the power contained in specular reflections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib29" title="">29</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib30" title="">30</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib31" title="">31</a>]</cite>).

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib34" title="">34</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite> the authors show that the median difference in path loss by not considering diffraction was less than 0.05 dB, and the 90 percentile difference in path loss was less than a dB for a wooden wedge and a metallic wedge at 300 GHz. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib34" title="">34</a>]</cite> concluded that diffraction can be neglected almost everywhere in a room.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p3.1">Therefore, neglecting diffraction, NYURay models propagation due to specular reflections, transmissions, and diffuse scattering. Further, during calibration of specular reflection and transmission properties of materials, we assume that the scattered multipath components are much lower than specular multipath components.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p4.1">In every direction where a ray was launched, on encountering an intersection with an obstruction, three types of rays are created for further propagation analysis - the specular reflected ray, the scattered rays, and the transmitted ray. By Snell’s Law, the reflected ray and the incident ray make equal angles with the normal to the obstruction, while the transmitted ray propagates in the same direction as the incident ray, with a lateral displacement. However, signals at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies do not penetrate through walls with significant thickness, such as brick and concrete walls. Hence a “thin wall” assumption is made in this article, wherein the signals are assumed to propagate along the same path as the incident ray. Scattered rays are launched from the vertices of a half-icosahedron, centered at the point of incidence of the signal on the obstruction, as seen in Fig.<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ IV Ray Propagation Mechanisms ‣ Calibration of NYURay for Ray Tracing using 28, 73, and 142 GHz Channel Measurements conducted in Indoor, Outdoor, and Factory Scenarios"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> . The strongest scattered signals are simulated close to the direction of the specular reflection. The number of scattered rays, equal to the number of vertices of the half-icosahedron, is a user-controlled number.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p1.1">The reflected signal is assumed to follow Snell’s law at the point of incidence, i.e., the angle of incidence of the ray at the obstruction is equal to the angle of reflection. New source rays at each boundary are then recursively traced in the reflection direction to the next encountered obstruction on the propagating ray path.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p2.1">In the literature, reflection loss is often modeled using Fresnel’s equations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib36" title="">36</a>]</cite>. However, due to the highly non-linear nature of the equations, a closed form solution to minimizing the difference in the measured multipath component powers to the simulated ray tracer output to field measurements is not attainable. To reduce the complexity of the problem, researchers often choose to either assume that all objects in the environment possess the same relative permittivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>, or use extrapolated values of permittivity that were obtained from sub-6 GHz measurements that may not be accurate at higher frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p3.1">Taking inspiration from prior work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib37" title="">37</a>]</cite>, we propose the use of a simplified and more analytically tractable reflection loss model, wherein the reflection loss of a ray impinging an obstruction is assumed to be constant, independent of incident angle. As shall be explained in Section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#S7" title="VII Calibrating NYURay to Real-World Measurements ‣ Calibration of NYURay for Ray Tracing using 28, 73, and 142 GHz Channel Measurements conducted in Indoor, Outdoor, and Factory Scenarios"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>, such simplification allows for a closed-form solution for minimizing the difference in the measured and simulated path gains, allowing quick and accurate calibration of the electrical properties of the materials in the environment.

In this work, we shall derive a least-square formulation to determine both the reflection coefficients and the partition losses of obstructions in the signal path. Thus, the reflection propagation mechanism is simplified to an angle independent constant reflection loss model as follows:</p>

At sub-6 GHz frequencies, objects are relatively smooth (with a surface roughness smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave) due to which scattering is a much weaker propagation mechanism than reflection and is typically ignored in wireless communication design and simulations. In contrast, at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies, since the carrier wavelength is in the order of the surface perturbations of surfaces, the power carried by scattered rays needs to be considered, especially in NLOS conditions where the scattered rays may act as the dominant propagation mode in the absence of specular reflections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib36" title="">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

The measurements made by graduate students at NYU WIRELESS resulted in the creation of channel models for mmWave and sub-THz communications, demonstrating the viability of these frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib39" title="">39</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. The environments where the mmWave and sub-THz channel measurements were conducted are described in this section. Additionally, the hardware that was used to carry out the channel measurements is also introduced. Three generations of channel sounders were developed at NYU WIRELESS, starting with the first mmWave time-domain based sliding-correlation channel sounder operating at 28 GHz, followed by the mmWave channel sounder at 73 GHz, and the latest sub-THz channel sounder at 142 GHz.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.p1.1">The channel measurements were conducted using sliding-correlation based channel sounders operating at 28, 73, and 142 GHz. All three channel sounders had similar super-heterodyne RF architectures, wherein a pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence of 2047 chips in length (11 bits) was modulated to an intermediate frequency (IF) and then upconverted to the desired RF after mixing with a local oscillator in an RF upconverter.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.p2.1">The RF signal was transmitted out of a high-gain directional horn antenna mounted on an electronically controllable gimbal, capable of rotating in the azimuth and elevation plane. The RF signal is analogously received by high-gain directional horn antenna mounted on an identical gimbal at the RX. The RF signal at the RX is downconverted by an local oscillator (LO) signal, passed through a low noise amplifier (LNA) and is IQ demodulated to baseband. Details of the environment, RF bandwidths, TX and RX horn antenna half-power beamwidths, and gains of the TX and RX horn antennas used at each of the three frequencies (28, 73, and 142 GHz) are summarized in Table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-A Measurement equipment ‣ V mmWave and sub-THz Channel Measurements ‣ Calibration of NYURay for Ray Tracing using 28, 73, and 142 GHz Channel Measurements conducted in Indoor, Outdoor, and Factory Scenarios"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.p3.1">To capture all arriving multipath propagation in the environment, the TX and RX gimbals were rotated in the azimuth and elevation plane. The gimbal may be swept 360° in the azimuth and 120° in the elevation plane in 1° steps, allowing double directional channel measurements (i.e., both AoA and AoD information was obtained from the channel measurements). A channel power-delay-profile (PDP) was captured at different TX-RX antenna pointing combinations. The channel sounder used for channel measurements at 28 GHz had an RF bandwidth of 800 MHz, while the channel sounders at 73 and 142 GHz utilized an RF bandwidth of 1 GHz. Multipath components separated by less than the PN sequence chip width could not be separately resolved, thus a multipath component resolution time of 2.5 ns was possible at 28 GHz while a slightly lower resolution of 2 ns was achieved at 73 and 142 GHz. The time resolution of the measurement system limits the multipath-resolving capability of the system, since multipath components arriving within the time resolution of the channel sounder are indistinguishable, if arriving from the same direction. Multipath components that arrived within the time resolution of the channel sounder, from different directions, were resolvable due to the highly directional horn antennas that acted as spatial filters, suppressing multipath components not arriving from the direction in which the TX and RX antennas were pointed in the directional measurements. If the difference in propagation distance of two multipath components were less than 75 cm in the 28 GHz measurement campaign (60 cm in the 142 GHz measurement campaign), the difference in arrival times of the multipath components would be 2.5 ns (2 ns in the 142 GHz measurement campaign). Thus, two multipath components with path lengths differing by less than 75 cm at 28 GHz and 60 cm at 142 GHz would be indistinguishable, if arriving from the same direction.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS2.p2.1">Similarly, in the presence of non-negligible diffraction and scattering, a closed form solution for the interaction losses of materials is unknown. Hence, iterative approaches such as simulated annealing can be utilized to obtain the diffraction and scattering parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib62" title="">62</a>]</cite>. In simulated annealing, a solution is iteratively improved by exploring neighboring solutions, with a non-zero probability of accepting worse neighboring solutions in each iteration step. This approach reduces the likelihood of the algorithm getting stuck in local optima, thereby enhancing the chances of finding a global optimum.</p>

A reduction in RMS delay spread was observed at higher frequencies due to greater penetration loss through various obstructions in the environment, leading to fewer (and weaker) multipath components.</p>

As is seen from the difference in the measured and predicted mean RMS angular spread and RMS delay spreads in the indoor office and outdoor environments, NYURay under-predicted the angular and delay spreads by 10% and 20% respectively, in indoor and outdoor environments. The underprediction was due to the incomplete environmental knowledge available for ray tracing - small objects in the environment resulted in signal reflections that were not predicted by the ray tracer. As seen in the tables, the accuracy of both optimization techniques was similar. Hence the optimization technique in the decibel domain is preferred due to the closed form nature and guaranteed convergence.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p6.1">Using the optimization technique in the decibel domain, a good agreement between the measured and simulated multipath powers was observed for the indoor measurement campaigns at 28 and 142 GHz, the outdoor measurement campaigns at 28, 73, and 142 GHz, and for the four factory measurement campaigns (Factory A, Factory B, Factory C, and Factory D - all at 142 GHz), as seen in Fig. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#S7.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ VII-B Optimization in the Linear Domain ‣ VII Calibrating NYURay to Real-World Measurements ‣ Calibration of NYURay for Ray Tracing using 28, 73, and 142 GHz Channel Measurements conducted in Indoor, Outdoor, and Factory Scenarios"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p7.1">To determine the probability distribution of the error in the predicted directional multipath power, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) of the Normal, Beta, Gamma, Exponential, Nakagami, Rayleigh, and Rician distribution was compared. The probability distribution within minimal AIC was chosen to model the error in the predicted directional multipath power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03104v1#bib.bib64" title="">64</a>]</cite>. The error distribution of the directional multipath component power was a Gaussian random variable in all the measurement campaigns. For the indoor office measurements at 28 and 142 GHz, the mean of the error in power predicted was 0.1 and 0.7 dB, while the standard deviation of the error in power predicted was 4.4 dB and 3.9 dB respectively. For the outdoor environments the mean error was 1.1 dB, 0.0 dB, and 0.0 dB and the standard deviation was equal to 3.2 dB, 2.6 dB and 2.6 dB at 28, 73, and 142 GHz respectively. For the factory environment measurements conducted at 142 GHz, a mean error of 0.5 dB, 0.0 dB, 0.0 dB, and 0.2 dB was measured and the standard deviations of error was equal to 2.3 dB, 3.4 dB, 2.5 dB, and 3.6 dB respectively at Factory A, B, C, and D.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p8.1">The accuracy of the calibrated ray tracer was characterized by noting the standard deviation of the absolute error in the simulated directional multipath power. For the indoor office measurement campaigns at 28 and 142 GHz, the standard deviation of the absolute error in power predicted was 2.7 dB and 2.8 dB respectively. Since the outdoor environments were less cluttered, NYURay was able to better predict the directional multipath power, with standard deviations of absolute error of 2.0 dB, 1.6 dB and 1.7 dB at 28, 73, and 142 GHz respectively. For the factory environment measurements at 142 GHz, the detailed 360-degree videos of the environment near the TX and RX enabled calibration to greater accuracy than the indoor office measurement campaigns, resulting in standard deviations of absolute error equal to 2.0 dB, 1.9 dB, 1.7 dB, and 2.3 dB respectively at Factory A, B, C, and D.</p>

Although NYURay does not predict all of the multipath components that are measured at a delay of 35 ns, there is often good agreement in the other multipath components’ powers. The strongest multipath component’s measured power, in particular, is within 2 dB of the power that NYURay predicted.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S10.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S10.p1.1">In this study, NYURay, a 3-D mmWave and sub-THz ray tracer, was introduced and calibrated using mmWave and sub-THz channel measurements at 28, 73, and 142 GHz taken in indoor office, outdoor UMi, and factory environments. Accurately calibrated ray tracers can be used to test radio coverage when deploying wireless systems indoors and outdoors, to reduce the chance of coverage gaps, and can generate synthetic data to evaluate sensing algorithms or train machine learning applications, which would otherwise require a large amount of measured data. Traditional calibration approaches assume angle-dependent reflection, requiring slow iterative optimization techniques with no closed form solution. Linear and logarithmic calibration procedures were described in this paper. Both calibration processes performed similarly, however the logarithmic calibration procedure introduced in this paper can quickly and accurately calibrate any ray tracer to real world measurements, providing a closed form solution. Any ray tracer could be easily calibrated to directional data using the calibration process described in this paper. Using the logarithmic calibration procedure, the error in the predicted multipath power was a Gaussian random variable. The calibration performance was characterized by noting the standard deviation of the absolute error of the predicted directional multipath power. In the indoor office environment at 28 and 142 GHz, the standard deviation of absolute error in the multipath power was 2.7 and 2.8 dB, respectively, and 2.0 dB, 1.6 dB, and 1.7 dB in the outdoor environments at 28, 73, and 142 GHz. In the factory environments, due to the availability of a 360 degree video of the environment, the standard deviation in the absolute error of the predicted multipath power was low (2.0 dB, 1.9 dB, 1.7 dB, and 2.3 dB in Factory A, B, C, and D).</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S10.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S10.p2.1">Due to the incompleteness of the environmental map utilized for ray tracing, the RMS angular spread of omnidirectional measurements were underestimated in indoor office setting and the outdoor environment by 10% while the RMS delay spread was underestimated by 20%. The precision of mmWave and sub-THz ray tracing can be increased by using a more precise environmental map.
The electrical characteristics of building materials were also reported in this research based on the ray tracer calibration process. The loss due to reflection and penetration increased with frequency. At 28 GHz, materials were the most reflecting when compared to higher frequencies.</p>
