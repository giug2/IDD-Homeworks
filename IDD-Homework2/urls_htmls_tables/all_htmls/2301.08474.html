<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To prevent implicit privacy disclosure in sharing gradients among data owners (DOs) under federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP) and its variants have become a common practice to offer formal privacy guarantees with low overheads. However, individual DOs generally tend to inject larger DP noises for stronger privacy provisions (which entails severe degradation of model utility), while the curator (i.e., aggregation server) aims to minimize the overall effect of added random noises for satisfactory model performance.
To address this conflicting goal, we propose a novel dynamic privacy pricing (DyPP) game which allows DOs to sell individual privacy (by lowering the scale of locally added DP noise) for differentiated economic compensations (offered by the curator), thereby enhancing FL model utility.
Considering multi-dimensional information asymmetry among players (e.g., DO's data distribution and privacy preference, and curator's maximum affordable payment) as well as their varying private information in distinct FL tasks, it is hard to directly attain the Nash equilibrium of the mixed-strategy DyPP game.
Alternatively, we devise a fast reinforcement learning algorithm with two layers to quickly learn the optimal mixed noise-saving strategy of DOs and the optimal mixed pricing strategy of the curator without prior knowledge of players' private information.
Experiments on real datasets validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of faster convergence speed and enhanced FL model utility with lower payment costs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Driven by the unprecedented amount of data generated by smart devices, recent years have witnessed the exciting advances of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, for a wide range of smart applications such as smart surveillance and machine translation. In the traditional centralized AI paradigm, data across various data owners (DOs) such as mobile users should be concentrated for data mining and model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which raises severe privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed AI paradigm which allows DOs to collaboratively train a shared AI model without disclosing their local private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In a typical FL system, DOs periodically send the intermediate gradients (i.e., local model update) computed on local datasets to the curator (which synthesises a global model). Then, the curator distributes the updated global model back to DOs for next-round distributed on-device learning. This procedure is repeated until achieving a desirable accuracy of the global model. Under FL, DOs' private data are kept on local devices, thereby greatly mitigating user privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, evidences have demonstrated that FL can be susceptible to advanced inference attacks such as membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> (that infer whether a particular data sample is involved in a DO's private training dataset) and model reconstruct attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> (that recover DOs' private training data) in exchanging intermediate gradients. To enhance privacy protection, differential privacy (DP) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have become a common practice in FL due to the low overheads and rigorous privacy guarantees, where DOs independently obfuscate local model updates by adding artificial DP noises.
However, in practical DP-based FL applications, self-interested DOs tend to inject larger random noises to enforce stronger privacy provisions, which eventually entails severe degradation of model utility. By contrast, the curator aims to minimize the overall effect of injected DP noises for satisfactory model performance. Additionally, DOs typically exhibit heterogeneous privacy expectations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For example, DOs can have distinct sensitivity levels towards potential privacy leakage under the uniform privacy protection level (PPL).
Therefore, it necessities a privacy-utility tradeoff in FL while satisfying DOs' customized privacy expectations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As an attempt to address this issue, Sun <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> recently introduced a personalized privacy pricing approach named Pain-FL, which offers differentiated PPL-payment contracts for DOs with customized privacy expectations in exchange of their reduced scale of locally added DP noises. In Pain-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, each DO selects an optimal PPL-payment contract and perturbs its local model update with that PPL in exchange for the corresponding payment. Accordingly, only moderate amount of DP noises is added by DOs, thereby ensuring satisfactory model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are still significant challenges remaining to be resolved. 1) The design of optimal contracts in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> requires precise distribution information of DOs' privacy types, which can be non-trivial in practice. For example, the same DO may have distinct privacy requirements when undertaking different FL tasks involving different local private data; meanwhile, DO's privacy preferences may change over time. 2) Pain-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> only considers DOs' diverse privacy types in contract design while their multi-dimensional private information (e.g., local data size and distribution) is neglected, which inevitably deteriorates the contract efficiency. 3) As the optimal contracts are centrally designed by the curator in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and only support pure strategy, it lacks contract adaptability and feasibility under distributed and mixed-strategy contract design settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, this paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based privacy pricing scheme to intelligently learn the optimal privacy trading strategies (i.e., injected DP noise scale strategy of DOs and pricing strategy of the curator) without the reliance on prior knowledge of players' private information.
Specifically, we first formulate the interactions between DOs and the curator as a dynamic privacy pricing (DyPP) game with mixed strategy. In DyPP game, the curator determines privacy pricing strategies for heterogeneous DOs with multi-dimensional private information (i.e., privacy cost, training data size, and data distribution); while each DO determines the amount of traded privacy by varying the variance of locally injected Gaussian noise. To derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game under the dynamic and uncertain environment with multi-dimensional information asymmetry, we also devise a fast RL algorithm with two tiers, by leveraging Win or Learn Fast Policy Hill-Climbing (WoLF-PHC) methods, to quickly search the optimal mixed-strategy policies for both DOs and the curator.
Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can fast converge to the NE and improve model utility with lower payments.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a number of efforts have been reported to seek a privacy-utility balance in FL from the perspective of economic incentives, and many of them are based on the contract theory.

Particularly, the curator tends to minimize the variance of totally added Gaussian noises for satisfactory model performance with a low payment, while DOs tend to add Gaussian noises with higher variances to pursue stronger privacy provisions.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the existence of multi-dimensional information asymmetry, the curator is usually unaware of the distribution of privacy cost (or privacy preference) among DOs, while DOs are usually unaware of the curator's payment model (e.g., maximum affordable payment and sensitivity to model quality). Besides, the preferences of the curator and DOs may vary under dynamic and uncertain environments. For instance, when undertaking different FL missions, a DO can have distinct privacy expectations and the curator can have distinct sensitivities to model quality.
Under such strong information asymmetry scenarios, the curator and DOs can separately employ the WoLF-PHC algorithm (a model-free RL method) to derive the optimal policy in the mixed-strategy DyPP game under dynamic and uncertain environments.</p>

These two figures show that our two-layer WoLF-PHC scheme can accelerate the convergence rate and improve model utility, compared with the two-layer Q-learning and greedy schemes. Among the three approaches, the greedy scheme has the fastest convergence rate but suffers the worst model performance. The two-layer Q-learning requires the largest iterations to obtain the optimal policy for both sides, and its slow convergence may lower DOs' willingness to join DyPP game to trade privacy for utility in FL.
Besides, in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Experiment Setup ‣ V PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ‣ Trade Privacy for Utility: A Learning-Based Privacy Pricing Game in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the saved DP noise scale keeps increasing before attaining a stable value, while the corresponding payment in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Experiment Setup ‣ V PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ‣ Trade Privacy for Utility: A Learning-Based Privacy Pricing Game in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> keeps decreasing before it converges to the stable state.
The reason is that the initial high compensation motivates DOs to gradually increase their saved noise scales by adding Gaussian noise with smaller variance for higher payoffs. Meanwhile, after observing DOs' high noise-saving actions, the curator intends to gradually reduce its payment for enhanced payoff.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For better privacy-utility tradeoff in practical DP-based FL services, this paper has proposed a novel DyPP game approach that allows DOs to trade individual privacy (i.e., determining the local noise-saving strategy) for improved global model utility by providing differentiated payment contracts to compensate DOs' privacy losses.
In the DyPP game, the multi-dimensional information asymmetry between DOs and the curator, as well as their varying private information under distinct FL tasks, poses a challenge to derive the closed-form expression of the NE. We have also devised a fast RL algorithm to enable both DOs and the curator to quickly learn their optimal policies and adapt to dynamic and uncertain environments without being aware of the player's private information.
Experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme attains a faster convergence rate and enhanced model utility with lower payments, compared with benchmarks.
For future work, the DyPP game with bounded rationality and continuous action space in FL will be investigated.</p>
