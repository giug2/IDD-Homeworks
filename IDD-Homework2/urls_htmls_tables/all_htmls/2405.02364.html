<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a critical approach in machine learning to address privacy concerns associated with centralized data storage and processing. VFL facilitates collaboration among multiple entities with distinct feature sets on the same user population, enabling the joint training of predictive models without direct data sharing. A key aspect of VFL is the fair and accurate evaluation of each entity’s contribution to the learning process. This is crucial for maintaining trust among participating entities, ensuring equitable resource sharing, and fostering a sustainable collaboration framework. This paper provides a thorough review of contribution evaluation in VFL. We categorize the vast array of contribution evaluation techniques along the VFL lifecycle, granularity of evaluation, privacy considerations, and core computational methods. We also explore various tasks in VFL that involving contribution evaluation and analyze their required evaluation properties and relation to the VFL lifecycle phases. Finally, we present a vision for the future challenges of contribution evaluation in VFL. By providing a structured analysis of the current landscape and potential advancements, this paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners in the design and implementation of more effective, efficient, and privacy-centric VFL solutions. Relevant literature and open-source resources have been compiled and are being continuously updated at the GitHub repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cuiyuebing/VFL_CE" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/cuiyuebing/VFL_CE</a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of collaborative learning and intelligence, the accurate assessment of individual contributions is paramount. This process, known as contribution evaluation, is fundamental to the success of any cooperative endeavor, ensuring that each participant’s efforts are fairly recognized and that the collective work benefits from the strengths of all parties involved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As we progress into an age where data privacy is of the utmost concern, contribution evaluation becomes even more critical in the context of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the rapid advancement of data-driven models has advanced technological progress but also raised significant concerns about data privacy. The proliferation of digital interactions and transactions in our modern society has led to an astounding increase in the generation of personal data. Consequently, there has been a surge in the public’s concern for privacy, prompting legislators across the globe to enact stringent privacy protection laws and regulations. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> emphasizes individual rights and data transparency. The USA navigates privacy concerns through the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, granting residents control over their personal information. China’s Data Security Law (DSL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> underscores the secure and controllable use of data, restricting cross-border data transfer. Against this background, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> emerges as a critical innovation, offering a privacy-centric approach to machine learning by decentralizing the model training process, thereby reducing privacy risks associated with centralized data storage.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The categorization of FL is primarily based on the partitioning of data across the sample and feature spaces, which results in three distinct forms: Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), and Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. VFL stands out for its unique ability to enable collaboration among different entities that may have overlapping user samples, yet possess disparate sets of features for the same individuals. A two-party VFL setting is illustrated in Fig <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Survey on Contribution Evaluation in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Through VFL, entities can jointly train machine learning models without exposing their raw data, thus maintaining the privacy and confidentiality mandated by law. This approach ensures compliance with privacy regulations while harnessing the collective power of data held across various domains. The role of VFL becomes even more pronounced when considering scenarios where data cannot be pooled due to privacy concerns or logistical challenges, making it a keystone technology in the modern data-centric landscape. The potential applications of VFL are manifold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In the financial world, VFL enables banks and credit agencies to enhance fraud detection systems without sharing sensitive customer information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In healthcare, hospitals, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies can collaborate to refine diagnostic tools and develop personalized treatments while preserving patient privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Similarly, in the realm of telecommunications, companies can optimize network operations and customer service by integrating data across different service providers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Contribution evaluation plays an important role in this collaborative endeavor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. It ensures accountability within the VFL framework. By quantifying and crediting the input of each participant, it establishes a transparent system where the efforts of all contributors are duly recognized. This transparency fosters trust among participants, which is essential for sustaining long-term collaboration. Furthermore, contribution evaluation enables the identification of outliers or potential free-riders within the FL ecosystem. By assessing the quality and consistency of contributions, it helps detect any discrepancies or deviations from expected norms. This proactive approach not only safeguards the integrity of the FL process but also encourages active engagement from all participants. Moreover, contribution evaluation facilitates the allocation of resources and rewards based on merit. Participants who consistently demonstrate high-quality contributions can be incentivized accordingly, motivating them to continue their valuable input. Conversely, those who underperform can receive targeted support or interventions to enhance their involvement, ensuring that the collective effort remains robust and productive. Additionally, contribution evaluation provides valuable insights for optimizing the FL workflow. By analyzing patterns and trends in participant contributions, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and refine their strategies accordingly. This data-driven approach fosters continuous learning and evolution within the VFL ecosystem, driving innovation and efficiency over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Though the process of contribution evaluation has been deployed in various VFL applications and tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, there is currently no consensus on what constitutes the overarching goal or objective of contribution evaluation in the setting. Furthermore, there is a lack of an established taxonomy or classification system to clearly differentiate and systematically categorize the methods that have been proposed for evaluating contributions in VFL systems. This absence of a uniform, well-defined approach with standardized terminology has led to a chaotic situation where the assessment of contributions is often subjective, inconsistent, and contentious across different VFL implementations. The lack of structured guidance also makes it challenging to objectively compare, select, and improve upon existing evaluation techniques. As such, the establishment of a comprehensive, structured taxonomy for defining and classifying contribution evaluation methodologies in VFL is essential for the advancement of the field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this survey, we present an in-depth exploration of existing literature and provide the taxonomy of contribution evaluation in VFL. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, we define contribution evaluation by considering its position in the lifecycle of VFL process: data collection/preprocessing, where data quality and relevance take center stage; model training, which relies heavily on computational contributions and algorithmic efficiency; and model inference, where the practical applicability of the model is tested and the reward of downstream application is allocated. Recognizing the unique contributions in each of these phases is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of the value each participant adds to the VFL collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We further investigate contribution evaluation according to its ingredients: the objects and subjects of contribution evaluation, contribution evaluation methods, and tasks related to contribution evaluation. We begin by explicitly summarizing the existing studies according to the objective of contribution evaluation, which can be categorized by granularity into the levels of features and parties. This categorization helps in understanding the target of evaluation, whether it is on individual input features or the collective of a participating party. Since the process of contribution evaluation usually involves information sharing and processing across multiple parties, if looking from the side of the contribution evaluation objective, i.e., the entities that performing contribution evaluation, privacy arises as an important concern. We discuss how existing literature deals with privacy issues from the perspectives of the target data, the contribution calculation agent (the party where the contribution is calculated and compared), and the privacy protection method. It is clear that a delicate balance between accurate contribution assessment and privacy preservation is paramount and the existing strategies aim to strike this balance without compromising either aspect. Then we take the angle of the roadmap of the main techniques, which contains Shapley value based, leave-one-out based, individual based, and interaction based. It should be noted that no single technology is universally superior; rather, the context and requirements of the VFL task should guide the selection of the evaluation methodology. Appropriate adaptation and integration of these techniques can lead to more comprehensive and effective methods for contribution evaluation. Contribution evaluation is also operated differently in different tasks. We delve into details of how it works in feature selection, interpretable VFL, incentive mechanism design, and payment allocation, emphasizing their specific focused properties and methods. These insights illustrate the necessity of a tailored approach to contribution evaluation, one that respects the nuances and objectives of each unique VFL task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The literature reviewed in the survey was carefully curated from prestigious sources, including articles from IEEE and ACM-affiliated journals and conferences, as well as preprints from arXiv. The most current and authoritative research was included, covering the period from 2016 to 2024. Additionally, the study incorporated comprehensive surveys on FL and VFL published by Springer. We mainly use task-based and method-based keywords for paper searching. The task-based keywords, which include Feature Selection, Fairness, Contribution Evaluation/Valuation, Security, Incentive Mechanism, and Explainability/Interpretability, were chosen for their relevance to contribution evaluation. The method-based keywords, Shapley Value and Leave-One-Out, representing prominent methods used to quantify and analyze the contributions of individual data points or features in a dataset, were also used for searching.</p>

<p id="S2.Thmdefinition1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.Thmdefinition1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">In VFL, it is anticipated that the performance of the federated model surpasses that of models trained locally on isolated datasets, approaching the efficacy of a global model trained on centrally aggregated data. This expectation stems from the collaborative nature of VFL, which amalgamates diverse datasets across various entities, thereby enriching the training process without compromising data privacy. Unlike HFL, which primarily focuses on partitioned datasets with similar feature spaces, VFL is distinguished by its compatibility with a wide array of model architectures. This includes but is not limited to decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, linear regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, singular vector decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, and neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Such versatility enables VFL to be applied across a broad spectrum of applications, leveraging the unique strengths of different modeling approaches to optimize performance and achieve outcomes that closely mirror those of centralized data training methodologies.</span></p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our survey, we systematically classify the contribution evaluation methods within VFL across five main axes: the VFL lifecycle, the granularity of evaluation objects, the privacy awareness of evaluation subject, the core computational methods, and tasks involving contribution evaluation. Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III-A Problem Formulation ‣ III A taxonomy of Contribution Evaluation in VFL ‣ A Survey on Contribution Evaluation in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> provides a detailed overview, showing different perspectives on the existing research. The lifecycle dimension shows evaluation of contributions plays a key role throughout the learning process, identifying areas where targeted improvements could be made at different stages. The granularity axis explores the different levels at which evaluations are done. This includes evaluations at both large and small scales. We also emphasize the importance of privacy considerations in conducting these evaluations, especially in VFL where sensitive data from multiple parties is involved. Our classification outlines how methods balance accuracy with privacy concerns, and how our specific procedures support different levels of privacy. Then, the core methods axis focuses on the specific algorithms and technical approaches used for evaluations, e.g., Shapley values and informational entropy. This perspective allows for a comparison of how effective these methods are and how they relate to real-world use, helping to choose the most suitable evaluation technologies. Lastly, we discuss the roles contribution evaluation plays in different tasks, emphasising their unique focuses when performing contribution evaluation. Collectively, these aspects form a system for evaluating contributions in VFL that can adapt to different stages of the process and meet the needs of various applications downstream.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The lifecycle of VFL can be effectively divided into three distinct stages: data preprocessing, model training, and model inference. Each phase in the life cycle has distinct characteristics and requirements. Contribution evaluation methods suitable for one phase might not be as effective or relevant for another. By classifying these methods according to the VFL life cycle phases, it becomes possible to adopt the most appropriate and effective techniques for each phase. Furthermore, VFL involves a complex interplay of data, algorithms, and model outputs from multiple sources. Classifying contribution evaluation methods according to the VFL life cycle allows for a comprehensive assessment of contributions at each phase, providing a more complete picture of how each entity’s input affects the overall process and outcomes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Participants in VFL initially establish the objectives of their collaborative task and work towards a consensus on data, models, and other pertinent elements. This phase primarily comprises two key tasks. The first task involves entity alignment, a process facilitated by encryption-based user ID alignment methodologies, as outlined in prior research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This technique confirms the shared users among participating entities, enabling collaboration while ensuring privacy. Notably, during entity alignment, the involved parties remain unaware of the non-overlapping users across their datasets. The second task pertains to data preprocessing. Aligned with the requirements of the VFL task, each participant modifies the aligned training and inference datasets to render them conducive for machine learning model development. Typically, individual parties process and locally store their data to comply with security and privacy constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Commonly used data preprocessing methods at this phase usually involve dimensionality reduction and feature selection. By evaluating the contribution of each feature, VFL can select which features are most relevant to the learning task. This is particularly important in VFL scenarios as parties may not have a complete view of the entire dataset. Each party typically holds a subset of features of the same sample IDs, and not all features might be equally informative. Contribution evaluation provides an efficient way for all parties to understand which parts of the data (i.e., parties or features) are most significant for the model before training, facilitating a better collaborative understanding and trust in the model’s decisions. And it helps in this process by highlighting which features to focus on, leading to more efficient computation and potentially reducing the complexity of the learning model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There have been some studies focusing on how to evaluate contributions during the data preprocessing phase.
A multi-dimensional hierarchical contribution evaluation method was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> that takes the quality of raw data into account during the data preprocessing phase. It achieves this by integrating a data correlation score with a data quantity score, culminating in a comprehensive assessment of data quality. This evaluation then informs the determination of each participant’s contribution.
The study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> introduced a vertical joint mutual information estimator capable of estimating the mutual information between participants’ features and labels. Then it adopts a group testing approach to identify the most informative subset of participants. This selection process significantly enhances the contribution of the chosen participants to the efficacy of subsequent model training.
Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> propose a model-free and privacy-preserving data valuation method for VFL, named FedValue. This method is designed to evaluate the contribution of data parties to predictive analytics tasks during the data preprocessing stage without the need to execute machine learning models. It utilizes an information-theoretic approach based on the Master-conditioned Shapley Value, which accounts for the substitution effect among data from different parties. This approach allows for a fair and efficient assessment of each data party’s information contribution to VFL tasks.
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> propose the federated stochastic dual-gate-based feature selection (FedSDG-FS). The first step of this approach uses Gini impurity in conjunction with partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) to securely and efficiently initialize the importance of features in the data preprocessing phase. This allows for an efficient and secure selection of significant features, contributing to enhanced performance and faster convergence of the global VFL model.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection"><span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.5.1.1" class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2 </span>Model Training</h4>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After data preprocessing, participants can start training VFL models locally using aligned samples. This phase primarily comprises two key tasks. The first task involves the training round, which adapts to diverse model requirements inherent in VFL, encompassing linear regression models, tree models, neural networks, etc. This stands in contrast to HFL, where the server predominantly aggregates neural network models from all participating parties. Therefore, the training round is model-specific, and its training details and passed intermediate parameters are determined by the specific model. The prevalent training protocol for federated neural network models involves utilizing gradient descent, necessitating the transmission of local model outputs and corresponding gradients across all participating parties, instead of sharing local data. The second task is training verification. At the conclusion of each training round, all participating parties conduct inference verification on the training model to ascertain whether the outcomes align with the defined objectives. This process includes the selection of participants or features based on the contribution made by the data party during training, aiming to eliminate inactive participants and irrelevant features. Additionally, all parties engage in mutual verification to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the training process. Based on these verification results, decisions are made on whether to continue participation in the VFL task. These two tasks are usually executed alternately multiple times until the training results meet the task requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Contribution evaluation during the training phase generally serves two purposes. The first is to optimize model performance. By evaluating the contribution of each feature or party, VFL models can be optimized for better performance. This evaluation helps in identifying which features or participants are most predictive and should be given more importance during training, leading to more accurate and efficient models.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> introduce an efficient and privacy-preserving feature selection scheme, particularly in eHealth systems. It designs a general framework based on Gini-impurity to select features that contribute greatly to model training. These protocols allow for private and efficient feature selection in VFL, demonstrating significant accuracy gains in medical datasets while maintaining communication and computational efficiency.
Ge et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> propose a presents an empirical study on failure prediction in production lines using federated learning. It improves federated random forest for VFL by introducing feature selection and pruning steps, ensuring that only the most contributive features are selected for the final model. The findings indicate that improved algorithms can achieve comparable results to centralized methods in manufacturing failure prediction.
The second step of FedSGD-FS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> mention above is about secure feature selection during training, involving forward and backward propagation on the client and server. The process includes computing and encrypting embedding vectors by clients, which are then processed by the server to evaluate feature contributions for feature selection and to train the model, all while preserving data privacy.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> propose a method for feature contribution evaluation during the training phase using a particle swarm optimization-based approach. The approach effectively removes irrelevant features, focusing on those contributing most significantly to model accuracy, while maintaining data privacy.
Feng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> propose the multi-participant multi-class VFL (MMVFL) framework, designed for multi-class classification problems in VFL with multiple participants. A feature importance evaluation scheme is also introduced, which quantifies the contribution of each participant’s different features to the VFL model and determines which features are prioritized during the training period.
Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> propose a method for VFL with correlated differential privacy (CRDP-FL). It introduces a privacy-preserved VFL training approach based on differential privacy between organizations and incorporates feature selection to improve algorithm efficiency and model performance.
Castiglia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> introduce an embedding-based feature selection method in a communication-efficient manner. The server identifies significant embedding components from each party’s pre-trained models. Then each party removes non-significant features locally, based on significant embedding components identified by the server.
The method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> simultaneously enforces row sparsity constraints on each dimension of the input data of each party to measure feature importance. It uses the first layer parameters of the model as a regularization function to make feature selection more detailed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second is to measure the real contribution of all parties in the model training phase. Participants not only need to provide high-quality data when participating in VFL training but also consume a large amount of computing resources. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess the contributions of all parties during the training phase and establish an effective incentive mechanism. Parties are more likely to engage in the federated learning process when they know that their contributions are recognized and valued. This evaluation can also help in mitigating the risk of free-riding, where some parties might benefit from the model without contributing significantly.
The method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> for evaluating contributions during the training phase is the vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV). This method computes contributions at multiple time points during training, using client embeddings at different timestamps. It addresses the challenges of model dependence in VFL and is designed for both synchronous and asynchronous VFL environments. It can effectively evaluate the contributions of all parties in the training phase without requiring model retraining.
The method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> for contribution evaluation during the training phase is named DIG-FL. This approach efficiently estimates the Shapley value of each participant without requiring model retraining. It’s applicable to both VFL and HFL. This method allows dynamic adjustment of participants’ weights based on their per-epoch contributions, thereby improving the accuracy and convergence speed of the model training.
Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> develop a multi-dimensional contribution-aware reward distribution mechanism, evaluating contributions based on data quality and model contributions during data preprocessing and model training respectively. By training local models and assessing prediction accuracy using the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), this approach promotes fairness and encourages participation in VFL training.
The method proposed by Khan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> for model contribution evaluation during the training phase is based on the concept of the bankruptcy problem. This method calculates the contribution of each party by measuring the improvement in model performance and then distributes the ”profit” (or incentive) based on these contributions. This method ensures a fair and efficient distribution of rewards among participants, encouraging their involvement in the federated learning process.
The method proposed by Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> for evaluating participant contributions during the training phase is centered around a Stackelberg game model. It involves calculating the Shapley value for each participant’s data, signifying their contribution. This value is then integrated into a data pricing model, where the hosts act as leaders and the guest as the follower. The model accounts for contribution scores and pricing strategies, ultimately determining the optimal data usage and pricing policy for both guests and hosts. This approach balances fair compensation with effective resource utilization in the training procedure.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During model inference, a trained model is deployed to make predictions on new data. Unlike the verification inference during model training, inference at this stage focuses on new user groups, exhibiting distinct data distributions. In this phase, all participants employ the trained model for collaborative inference on new data, using diverse metrics to holistically assess the model’s performance. Furthermore, model inference serves as a cornerstone for generating value in VFL tasks. Therefore, the provision of meaningful explanations regarding inference outcomes becomes crucial, fostering fairer and more transparent profit distribution mechanisms. Contribution evaluation plays a key role in this phase as it enhances the interpretability of the deployed model’s predictions. By understanding which features, and consequently, which parties contribute most significantly to a given prediction, users and stakeholders can gain insights into how the model is making its decisions.</p>

The method allows for robust and informative interpretation of FL models, ensuring data privacy while providing insight into the contribution of individual features.
Xing et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> propose a method for model interpretation in VFL named MI-VFL, which addresses feature discrepancy issues. The method aims to accurately identify important features and suppress overlapped ones, thereby improving model performance and interpretability in VFL with misaligned feature spaces.
The method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> for feature contribution evaluation in the model inference phase involves a complex process, integrating state-of-the-art interpretable methods in a decentralized setting such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Wang
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposes a feature contribution evaluation method based on Shapley values in model inference phase. The Shapley values are utilized to calculate the importance of grouped features. This measure of feature importance is then used to determine the contribution of each participating party in the FML setup.
The proposed method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> for evaluating the contribution of input features in VFL is a two-stage framework named Fed-EINI. This approach allows the guest party to understand the meanings of features held by the Host parties without compromising privacy, thus addressing the challenge of interpretability.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Feature-level contribution evaluation can be operated globally or locally. Global evaluation refers to the scenario where a server/host is aware of the features that participated in VFL and then evaluates the contribution of each individual feature on the global model. To achieve so, the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> can calculate feature importance globally. For example, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> simply traverse all possible sorting orders of features to calculate the Shapley Value of each specific feature vector for contribution evaluation. On the other hand, the contribution of features also needs to be evaluated locally on certain participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> aim at selecting the most representative features by each data party for a corresponding learning task on the task party. As the correlation between features can be found across data parties, feature-level contribution evaluation becomes even more challenging in the local view. It requires algorithms and models to extract meaningful insights considering such correlations when determining the significance of an individual feature. To deal with this problem, MI-VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> makes an attempt to adjust local importance to global importance and suppressing overlapped features among clients.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Confidentiality and privacy are the major concerns in feature-level contribution evaluation, as the individual features are private assets of the task party and the labels of the task party are also locally owned. To this end, feature-level contribution evaluation may pose more severe privacy risks. This is because it involves studying individual data points and their distinctive traits, which can lead to potentially sensitive information. Ensuring that no personally identifiable information is unintentionally exposed during the evaluation process can be a significant challenge, especially given the increasing global attention to data privacy standards and regulations. To deal with this challenge, Castiglia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> propose LESS-VFL. In LESS-VFL, feature-level evaluation is achieved by using embedding components provided by each data party as a proxy. The task party (referred to as the server in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>) evaluates if the embedding components from the data parties are non-significant and each data party matches the values of the significant embedding components while removing non-significant features from its model. To deal with anonymous features, Fed-EINI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> conceals decision paths and adapts a communication-efficient secure computation method for inference outputs. MMVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> adapts multi-view learning to share label information across multiple participants, but does not preserve data privacy in this process.</p>

In VFL, data from different parties is not shared or transferred; instead, insights are derived from decentralized data sources. The methodology of contribution evaluation typically refrains from utilizing raw data. However, as several existing works
suggest: the exchange of data elements, including labels and gradients, may inadvertently precipitate privacy breaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>. The susceptibility of various methods to such privacy intrusions varies, underscoring the necessity of a systematic classification based on their proficiency in safeguarding sensitive information. Our analysis of the pertinent literature is anchored on three cardinal criteria to ascertain the extent to which contribution evaluation methods may impinge upon data privacy. The foremost criterion is the <span id="S3.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">target data</span>, which stands as the quintessential determinant in assessing the potential for privacy leakage. This term delineates the specific data utilized in executing contribution calculations. The second criterion, <span id="S3.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">contribution calculation agent</span>, pertains to the entity designated with the responsibility of performing these calculations. This agent may operate on a local level, a centralized server, or through an external party. The same computation results in different privacy risks if it occurs locally and to a third party. The final criterion encompasses <span id="S3.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">privacy protection method</span>, which encompasses a spectrum of techniques employed to shield the target data. Our analysis will categorize and assess the extant literature on contribution evaluation within this domain from these three distinct perspectives.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In an effort to enhance our understanding of privacy awareness across various methods and to establish a standard for future methodologies, we have categorized protocols according to the type of target data they utilize. These classifications include private data, intermediate data, model-related data, and derived data.

P-0 focuses on evaluating contributions based on private data, which is the sensitive and proprietary information held by each participant. This protocol ensures that contribution assessments are directly tied to the unique data each participant brings to the VFL process. However, private data involves sensitive information and must not be shared outside of its original context, requiring strict privacy protection measures. This protocol appears to be at odds with the foundational premises of federated learning, which seeks to collaboratively leverage data while minimizing direct data exposure. Given this fundamental discrepancy, the application of the P-0 protocol for contribution evaluation is not recommended, as it may conflict with the overarching objectives of FL frameworks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contrasting with the direct utilization of private data for contribution evaluation, the establishment of an evaluation system centered on intermediate data represents a judicious compromise. Within the context of federated learning, such intermediate data typically encompasses elements like model embeddings and gradients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Embeddings, in this context, are advanced representations of the original features. They encapsulate complex relationships and patterns within the data, transforming them into a format more conducive to model training and analysis. By examining these embeddings, researchers can discern nuanced insights into how different data sets influence the overall model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, contribution evaluation is conducted by transmitting local embeddings from all participating parties to a centralized server. Distinctively, the method proposed by Castiglia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> advocate for local feature selection, utilizing a comparison of the squared difference between current and pre-trained embeddings. In the approach outlined by Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication framework is established between the task and data parties, enabling the direct transfer of local embeddings to the task party for the computation of the weighted Pearson correlation coefficient.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Gradients, on the other hand, are crucial indicators of how a model responds to each feature during the training process. They essentially reflect the sensitivity of the model to changes in different features. By analyzing gradients, it is possible to ascertain the specific impact of each data point or feature on the model’s learning trajectory. In the study presented by Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, the server employs a distinct approach for evaluating the contribution of participants in a federated learning environment. This method utilizes both gradients and the loss function as key metrics, calculating the participants’ contributions at each epoch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>, it has been demonstrated that the direct transmission of intermediate data in VFL can lead to privacy breaches. The two predominant forms of such privacy intrusions in VFL are feature inference attacks and label inference attacks. Feature inference attack entails a scenario where an adversarial entity, often an external participant in the training process, endeavors to reconstruct the private data of other parties by leveraging shared information within the learning protocol. Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> mention that the malicious task party will reconstruct the local original data of the data party based on the embedding submitted by the data party. Jin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> assume that the server has access to the data parties’ model parameters and their gradients. Therefore a malicious server can minimize the difference between the actual gradients from the true data and the gradients from the recovered data. And label inference attack in VFL manifests as a privacy violation where a participating entity, typically with malicious intent, seeks to infer sensitive label information from another party’s dataset. Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> highlight the potential for leakage of training sample labels through the gradient sign. And Qiu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> discuss an attack for inferring labels based on intermediate representations. This approach hinges on the exploitation of the relationship between the representations of samples and their corresponding labels. It involves a meticulous analysis of the distances among various sample representations, utilizing this data to deduce possible relationships or connections. These attacks are particularly pertinent in the context of VFL contribution evaluation. When the contribution calculation is conducted locally by a participant, there exists a potential risk that this participant may acquire additional insights about the data belonging to other parties, thereby facilitating the inference of both features and labels by malicious entities. Alternatively, if the contribution evaluation is managed by a third party possessing labeled data, a malicious third party could potentially exploit the intermediate data to uncover the original features of each participant. The methodologies for contribution evaluation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> exhibit potential privacy risks due to their practice of sharing intermediate data in plaintext with third parties. Contrastingly, the approach proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> primarily relies on the analysis of embeddings at different epochs, which are exclusively owned by the participants. This method inherently bears a lower risk of privacy leakage, as it avoids the external sharing of sensitive data in an unencrypted format.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to traditional methodologies, the use of model-related data in VFL contribution evaluation offers enhanced insights into the impact of each participant’s data on overall model performance. It helps in objectively quantifying the contribution of each party. Further, such evaluations can be categorized into two distinct types: black-box evaluation, which focuses on external performance indicators, and white-box evaluation, which delves into the internal mechanics of the model. This bifurcation allows for flexibility in choosing the evaluation method based on the desired balance between transparency and data privacy.</p>
</div>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Black-box evaluation involves assessing contributions based on external metrics. This method involves assessing a system’s functionality without knowledge of its internal workings. The evaluation is based solely on the input-output relationship. These indicators provide an overview of the model’s effectiveness without revealing its internal workings, thus maintaining data privacy and security. In the studies conducted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, the methodology for evaluating contributions involves a third party who assesses only the performance of the participating models. Crucially, these third parties do not have access to in-depth model details, nor to the raw or intermediate data utilized in the model’s training and operations. This approach ensures a level of privacy and security by limiting the information available to the third parties to just the performance outcomes of the models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Contrary to black-box, white-box evaluation involves a thorough examination of the internal logic and structure of the system.

Ge et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> use the local Gini coefficient for determining the optimal feature in a federated learning context. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> implement local Gini impurity for feature selection, focusing on each feature’s purity in classification tasks. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> adopt a different approach, using XGBoost locally to count feature split times, with the task party subsequently determining feature importance based on these averaged split times. Although these methods provide valuable insights into feature relevance, they also pose privacy concerns. Gini impurity and split times can reflect the distribution of original features to a certain extent, and may theoretically be used to infer or restore some features of the original data. Ge et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> do not encrypt the Gini impurity, while Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> employ PHE for enhanced security. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> normalize the split times of features held by each participant to prevent potential data distribution analysis by third parties. The feature selection methodology introduced by Feng <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> employs the initial layer parameters of models to ascertain feature contributions, incorporating these evaluations into the loss function via a regularization term to mitigate redundancy.</p>

In the work presented by Jiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, participants engage in a distance calculation between local and query data, subsequently encrypting these distances via HE before transmission to the aggregation server.

MMVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> constructs an embedding matrix, where each row is the representation of the corresponding data point. This matrix, serving as a pseudo-label for original features, incorporates regularization terms and orthogonality constraints, thus enhancing the interpretability of feature contributions. Meanwhile, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> propose a distinct feature contribution methodology that computes the ratio of feature frequency to the number of data subsets, identifying significant features based on a predetermined threshold. The interpretability framework established by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> determines the decision vector based on whether the leaf node is in the candidate set.

Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> converts federated Shapley-CMI calculation into calculating the intersection cardinality between parties in a manner that preserves the privacy of the original data. To facilitate these calculations on servers where trust may be an issue, they have devised a dual-server-aided private set intersection (PSI) cardinality computation mechanism, enhancing the security and privacy of the FL process.</p>

<div id="S3.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Primary methods for contribution evaluation in VFL are generally categorized into four groups in this subsection. The first group, Shapley Value-based methods, are rooted in cooperative game theory and assess contributions by examining the marginal effect of each participant across all possible coalitions. The second group, Leave-one-out (LOO) methods, streamline the evaluation by measuring the change in performance when omitting individual from the coalition, which provides efficiency but may raise fairness concerns. In contrast to the first two groups, which focus on the impact of excluding an individual from a coalition on model performance, the third group, individual-based methods, evaluates contributions from the perspective of each participant’s local data. These methods employ metrics such as mutual information or the Gini coefficient to quantify the value of individual contributions. Lastly, interaction-based methods evaluate contributions by comparing the local data of each participant through metrics such as learnable feature weights and correlation scores, which facilitate an interactive analysis.

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, it lacks fairness properties in Shapley value and thus the measurement may not be proper in some conditions. LOO fails to accurately evaluate the contribution of participants in the presence of duplicates or highly similar ones. The LOO-based metric can be sensitive to the order in which players are considered. Different orderings may lead to different contributions for the same player. Moreover, LOO may not be additive, meaning that the sum of individual contributions may not equal the value of the grand coalition. However, as fairness is subjective, it can be defined in other forms, which may be satisfied by LOO. For example, Khan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> adapt LOO using Talmud’s division rule, which ensures the fairness defined based on the Bankruptcy Problem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Gini impurity is a concept used in the context of decision trees and machine learning classification algorithms. In decision tree algorithms, the Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified. It is used to evaluate the quality of a split in the data during the construction of a decision tree. A node with low Gini impurity is considered ”pure,” meaning that most of the elements in that node belong to the same class. Therefore it can be used as the measurement of the feature importance score. Zhang et al. and Ge et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> calculate the Gini impurity of each individual feature w.r.t. the labels to measure the importance of a feature. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> indicate that directly using Gini impurity as feature importance is inappropriate as it cannot take into account the specific VFL models. Therefore, they propose FedSDG-FS, which takes Gini impurity as the initialization of features’ importance and learns the final indicators of whether a feature should be selected by jointly training an interactive layer with the VFL model that performs the downstream task.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As feature/party contribution evaluation can be interpreted as identifying the influence of features/parties, it has great similarity with sparse learning. Sparse selection is a process used in machine learning and statistics to identify and retain only the most relevant features or variables from a larger set of features. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting a subset of informative features while discarding irrelevant or redundant ones. Feng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> follow the idea of sparse learning and uses a transformation matrix to project data to new space. The L2 norm of corresponding row of the matrix is considered as the importance score of the feature. To ensure sparsity, it includes a regularization as penalty term. Instead of conducting sparsifying on original features, in VFLFS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, feature data is mapped into a lower-dimensional space in a way that preserves certain relationships or properties to measure its importance. VFLFS utilizes auto-encoder to project features into embedding space and measure the importance of features via a transformation matrix similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. Group lasso has also been widely used as a technique for sparsifying. It extends the lasso regularization to scenarios where features can be naturally grouped together. It introduces an additional penalty term that encourages sparsity not only at the individual feature level but also at the group level. Castiglia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> propose LESS-VFL that adapts the idea of group lasso to measure the importance of features. However, directly applying group lasso requires the feature to be selected by the server from a global view, and thus the parties and server need to exchange data embeddings and partial derivatives every iteration of training, which is communication inefficient. LESS-VFL deals with this by performing server-side and party-side group lasso hierarchically, where the goal of party-side group lasso is to select significant features that match the significant components selected by the server.</p>

For example, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> use stability feature selection to traverse the distributed data feature set across parties and filter out the less correlated features to the prediction. It then adopts Pearson’s correlation coefficient to merge feature sets on feature-partitioned distributed data. To protect privacy, DP noise is injected into the data.</p>

The feature importance is measured in a two-stage manner. First, on the side of each data party, it marks features as irrelevant if the split times are zero. Irrelevant features are removed in subsequent the stage. In the second stage, the multi‐participant cooperative particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search the optimal feature subset by taking the remaining features as full set.</p>

The data preprocessing phase encompasses tasks such as feature selection and payment allocation, during which participants determine the gradients of collaboration. The VFL training phase includes tasks related to feature selection, incentive mechanisms, and payment allocation, wherein the involved parties and their contributions are carefully monitored and adjusted in accordance with the optimization process of the VFL model. As for the VFL inference phase, it may involve tasks related to contribution evaluation, interpretable VFL, and payment allocation, where the efficacy of the model is evaluated.</p>

<div id="S3.SS6.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of VFL, the task of feature selection plays a pivotal role in enhancing the collaborative model-building process across decentralized data sources. The primary goal of feature selection in VFL is to identify and prioritize relevant features from each participant’s local dataset, contributing to the creation of a more concise and effective global model. Contribution evaluation, in this context, is intimately tied to assessing the significance of features contributed by each participant. The challenge lies in devising a contribution evaluation mechanism that not only accurately measures the impact of features on the global model but also efficiently selects these significant features as a prior of or at least simultaneously to the training process of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS6.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One line of works addresses feature selection within the framework comprising a central server/the task party and multiple other client participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. The selection process unfolds with the server controlling the objective of selection. The challenges lie in how to perform privacy preserving optimization of the selection process. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, the selection contains three stages. Firstly, models undergo pre-training in a standard VFL environment. Secondly, the server identifies the crucial embedding components among the clients’ sets. Thirdly, each party aims to align its model’s significant embedding components while discarding non-significant features.</p>

Feng <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> proposes VFLFS, which operates by jointly training a classifier model across all participating parties. Additionally, it imposes row sparsity on the weight matrix connecting the input layer to the second layer of the local model at each party to represent feature importance.</p>

<div id="S3.SS6.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Interpretable VFL represents another important task where the emphasis is on enhancing the transparency and comprehensibility of the collaborative model. The goal here is to provide interpretable insights into the contributions of individual participants/features. Interpretable FL is closely linked to contribution evaluation due to its capacity to elucidate prediction outcomes, aid in model debugging, and offer insights into the specific contributions made by individual data owners or data samples. This understanding is pivotal for the equitable allocation of rewards, which serves to incentivize proactive and dependable participation in FL endeavors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS6.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The very first challenge for interpretable VFL is privacy issue. Traditional model interpretation methods cannot be directly applied in VFL due to privacy concerns. Wang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> adapts SHAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite> for feature interpretation in VFL. It deals with privacy issue by passing feature IDs across parties to turn on and turn off specific features for calculating Shapley value, which is used as the measure of feature importance. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> address the task of improving the interpretability of vertical decision tree ensembles in FL. The interpretability issue is tackled by proposing a framework named Fed-EINI, which allows secure and interpretable inference. This involves disclosing the meanings of features from the Host party to the Guest party while ensuring the privacy of the decision paths by using encryption techniques. The importance of features is measured by the weight of corresponding nodes. Falcon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> introduces a framework, Falcon-INP, that supports interpretable methods like LIME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> in a decentralized setting, allowing interpretability calculations that ensure each party’s data remains private.

Xing et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> deal with the local-global discrepancy and local-local discrepancy caused by feature misalignment in interpretable VFL. It adjusts the local importance of features to align with their global importance using the law of total probability, ensuring that the selected features represent their true contribution to the model’s performance.

The goal is to establish a fair and transparent payment system that accurately reflects the contributions of each participant to the collaborative learning process. Contribution evaluation, in the context of payment allocation, is synonymous with the assessment of each participant’s impact on the global model’s performance, forming the basis for determining their respective share of the overall payment. The required properties for contribution evaluation in payment allocation extend to encompass fairness, efficiency, and transparency, ensuring an equitable distribution of rewards that aligns with the collaborative nature of VFL while upholding principles of fairness and accountability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The training diagram of VFL is designed to protect user privacy by not collecting private data. However, there are still privacy concerns that need to be addressed in the lifecycle of VFL training, and there is the possibility that the contribution evaluation be the victim of attackers. For example in the model training phase, threats including model attacks from semi-honest/malicious participants are worth noticing before evaluating the contribution. According to different attacking targets, model performance may be undermined in the scenario where malicious parties exist, leading to the false evaluation. And semi-honest parties could post threats on privacy during the evaluation process. Therefore, the design of VFL contribution evaluation should not only consider processing with the secured data but also the method itself should be secure. Thus the defence mechanisms should be clarified along with the contribution evaluation methods. Beyond conventional safeguards such as traditional differential privacy, homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computing, advanced techniques like zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>, <a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> and trusted execution environment (TEE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite> can also be used to ensure the security of the evaluation process from the algorithm and hardware levels respectively.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Communication overhead represents a critical consideration in the development of contribution evaluation methodologies. Certain approaches necessitate the frequent transfer of substantial data volumes, including embeddings or derived matrices, between parties and the agent responsible for calculating contributions. This can introduce significant bottlenecks, impeding the efficiency of the process in terms of both time and resource allocation. As the number of parties or the volume of data grows, contribution evaluation methods with high communication overhead struggle to manage the increased system load, with proportional increases in cost or decreases in performance. Furthermore, communication overhead can also have implications for privacy and security. More frequent or voluminous data exchanges increase the risk of interception or unauthorized access. Consequently, addressing communication overhead is imperative to realize the practical implementation of a feasible and sustainable VFL evaluation system. The one-shot VFL method designed by Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>]</cite> allow participants to perform two upload and one download operations during the training phase, markedly decreasing communication costs and frequency. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite> propose an asynchronous stochastic quasi-Newton framework for VFL, which can enhance convergence speed over SGD-based by approximating Hessian information, thus significantly diminishing the requisite number of communication rounds. Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite> have crafted an efficient VFL training framework that employs cache-enabled local update technology to improve system efficiency and introduces the abstraction of a workset table to slash communication costs. Despite these advancements, optimization of vertical contribution evaluation strategies, with a specific focus on communication overhead reduction, remains largely unaddressed, signifying a gap in current research efforts. While an existing contribution evaluation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> does acknowledge the importance of optimizing communication overhead, this aspect has yet to be prioritized adequately. Consequently, addressing communication overhead within the contribution evaluation process emerges as a critical and burgeoning objective for optimization. This gap underscores the necessity for dedicated research efforts aimed at developing methodologies that not only assess contributions effectively but also do so with an optimized communication footprint, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and sustainability of VFL systems.</p>

As the privacy guarantees become stronger, the amount of data and the number of messages that need to be exchanged often increase, leading to higher communication costs. Optimizing one without affecting the other negatively is a critical concern in VFL. Fair contribution evaluation requires a certain level of transparency into the data or model parameters of each participant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, which can conflict with the goal of privacy preservation.

Designing incentive mechanisms that reward participants for sharing high-quality data while maintaining privacy could be a key area of research. It is also promising to explore the feasibility and design of a marketplace for VFL resources, including the development of trading protocols, auction methods, bargaining methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and contract theories tailored for VFL.
