<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep neural network (DNN) models are effective solutions for industry 4.0 applications (<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>oil spill detection, fire detection, anomaly detection). However, training a DNN network model needs a considerable amount of data collected from various sources and transferred to the central cloud server that can be expensive and sensitive to privacy. For instance, in the remote offshore oil field where network connectivity is vulnerable, a federated fog environment can be a potential computing platform. Hence it is feasible to perform computation within the federation. On the contrary, performing a DNN model training using fog systems poses a security issue that the federated learning (FL) technique can resolve. In this case, the new challenge is the class imbalance problem that can be inherited in local data sets and can degrade the performance of the global model. Therefore, FL training needs to be performed considering the class imbalance problem locally. In addition, an efficient technique to select the relevant worker model needs to be adopted at the global level to increase the robustness of the global model. Accordingly, we utilize one of the suitable loss functions addressing the class imbalance in workers at the local level. In addition, we employ a dynamic threshold mechanism with user-defined worker’s weight to efficiently select workers for aggregation that improve the global model’s robustness. Finally, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation to explore the benefits of our solution and find up to 3-5% performance improvement than baseline federated learning methods.</p>

For instance, in a remote offshore hydrocarbon reservoir, various oil and gas (O&amp;G) companies can have extraction sites nearby <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that collect data using smart IoT devices. Here various companies’ data acquisition fog devices can be a potential source of training data for deep neural network models. Hence, the network connectivity to mainland cloud data centers is unreliable and costly (<span id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>using satellite communication) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering an oil spill incident in remote offshore oil field, our motivation is to train an oil spill detection DNN model utilizing the fog computing resources available in offshore. The main challenge with conventional centralized machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is that the security concern often leads to a less accurate DNN model due to a lack of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Hence, rival companies may not want to share their private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the oil spill is a low probability event that can appear in the training image rarely. Consequently, the training data set may have fewer occurrences of oil spill classes, making the problem context-dependent. Therefore, O&amp;G companies are motivated to adopt a solution to improve their DNN model’s quality without increasing data collection costs and preserving data privacy. Hence, we propose to utilize O&amp;G companies’ local computing resources (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>fog computing) by forming a federation of computing systems that solve unreliable and costly network communication to mainland cloud data centers and incorporate more data for training.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the viable solutions (presented in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) for security issues can be federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> that also support the utilization of computing resources across the fog federation. However, the problem is that data come from various sources, and it is feasible to assume that data distribution tends to be non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID). As such, lack of any priority class (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., oil spill</span>) that is termed as <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">class imbalance</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> can reduce the performance of the global model in an FL setup. Hence, ignoring the class imbalance issue, current federated learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are providing less robust DNN models. The robustness of FL training mainly depends on the local workers’ aggregation that affects the global model’s performance. In this case, a DNN detection model can show misleading high accuracy for all other classes while providing low performance for the desired class (oil spill). As such, we train a DNN model with an imbalanced data set using federated learning set up to understand the benefits of FL on class imbalance issues. We compared the training loss with the conventional method of single machine learning. In the figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the x-axis represents the various data sources (<span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>S1, S2, S3, S4, and centralized) with lowest loss epoch, whereas the y-axis represents the training loss. The centralized data source combines all four data sources with single central machine learning. The result (depicted in figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) indicates that federated learning has the lowest loss comparing single machine learning. In addition, to verify the convergence of the DNN model in federated learning setup, we capture the training loss for both central machine learning and vanilla federated learning setup. Figure <a href="#S1.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, represents the similar convergence trend for federated learning setup. Therefore, we are motivated to utilize a federated learning setup for oil spill detection DNN model training.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has drawn significant attention to the research community due to its security improvement and distributed nature. Especially, with the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> platforms utilizing the federation, has been the best suitable candidate for many remote industries. However, most of the current research mainly focuses on improving federated learning framework either concerning communication or considering computing resource bottleneck problems with the same existing data sets (<span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>MNIST, CIFAR) and the same area of image classification.

Then the noisy updates will be encrypted using the “paillier cryptosystem” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> before being sent to the central server.</p>

Due to preserving security, the FL model provides an effective solution to address covid-19 patients from X-ray images. Another application of federated learning could be oil spill detection using satellite image data set that usually fall under binary classification problems. However, very few research works have been conducted on semantic segmentation for oil spill detection. Moreover, multiple classes can be present in the same image, and each class is labeled with a specific color. Especially, using federated learning in semantic segmentation problems is rare in the academic research community.</p>

To overcome these challenges, Sheller <span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al. </span>in their work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> first introduced federated learning in semantic segmentation for brain tumor identification. In this work, authors utilize the semantic segmentation model (Unet) on multimodal brain scans and empirically discovered similar performance for those models trained by sharing data. However, the class imbalance is not present in their work. They also did not consider the robustness of the global model with an effective client selection mechanism. Our work would be one of the first pieces of research to utilize federated learning in oil spill detection that considers the class imbalance issue in the global model to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.9" class="ltx_p">An oil spill is a rare event in the satellite image data set, being a low probability event. Hence, this low occurrence event creates the class imbalance issue in oil spill detection training, leading to a less robust model against oil spill class or other victim classes. In the oil spill data set that we collect from MKLab <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, a computer vision research institute in Greece, the class imbalance issue is found significantly for oil spill class and ship class (table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>). In addition, typically, oil spill detection DNN model’s evaluation metrics can be misleading. For instance, DNN model accuracy considering classification problems for oil spill detection (when the data set has only two classes <span id="S4.p1.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>oil spill or not) can be significantly high. However, the intersection over union (a.k.a IoU) can be unsatisfactory for any particular class (<span id="S4.p1.9.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>oil spill). The low performance is that the DNN model is mostly exposed to the background class, and the oil spill class suffers from class imbalance. Hence, the problem of oil spill detection needs to be considered according to the data set, and specialized evaluation metrics need to be in place to train a model. Therefore, we consider oil spill detection as a semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> problem and utilize intersection over union as the evaluation metric.
We assume that class imbalance results from local data samples that influence the local FL worker models and gradually the global model. Hence the idea is to utilize a loss function that considers class imbalance issues. To achieve this goal, we choose the tversky index <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> to use as our objective loss function for training the DNN model that can be defined as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.p2.6" class="ltx_p">At the global level, a significant impact can be made with the worker selection technique. For instance, if the worker model is trained with a local data set that has less occurrence of oil spill class, then adding this update to the global model would reduce the model accuracy for the oil spill class. Therefore, typically all the local trained worker models are averaged (FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>) and set to the global model. Although other aggregation algorithms (<span id="S4.p2.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>FedSGD, FedProx) are present in literature, the FedAvg has proven performance against class imbalance issues. Accordingly, we start working with the FedAvg algorithm and utilize our system solution on top of FedAvg to make the algorithm robust against the class imbalance issue.
We utilize class-level intersection over union (IoU) to estimate worker weight and mean IoU as threshold estimate for selecting relevant workers. The worker’s weight can be defined as follows:</p>

The reason is that those workers have a significant performance for our priority class (<span id="S4.p2.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>oil spill class). The priority class can be different for a different context, and accordingly, weight can be adjusted. The relevant worker selection could lead to having fewer workers model for aggregation and decrease the performance of the global model. To handle this issue, we dynamically adjust the threshold value after every federated round depending on the number of relevant workers selected that maintains the robustness of the global model throughout the federated rounds.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a typical federated learning setup, the server (<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>fog device, cloud) stores a global ML model that is broadcast to the participating workers for training. We use one of the popular semantic segmentation DNN models named Unet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> for oil spill detection in the FL setup.

At first, some fog nodes agree to participate in the FL training, and they download the global model from the fog server presented in step 1 of figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV System Model ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Then, downloaded ML models are trained with their local data using the Tversky loss function in step 2.

Finally, in step 4, selected workers updated models are aggregated (new model), and the previous global model is updated accordingly. This whole process is considered a <em id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated round</em>. The updated model is again downloaded by participating workers for the next federated round, and the training continues.

To understand the advantage of using our proposed FL setup, we first tune the tversky loss function to find the minimum loss and then utilize the optimum configuration for the rest of the experiments. As we focus on class imbalance issues, we utilize non-IID and non-IID &amp; unbalance data distribution to measure the global model’s accuracy metric (mIoU) throughout the federated rounds. The main difference between the above mention setup is the number of classes distributed to the federated workers. In non-IID distribution, all the participating FL workers get the same number of classes, although classes are different for each worker. On the contrary, in non-IID &amp; unbalance distribution, each participating worker gets a different number of classes.

The result is demonstrated in figure <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI Environmental Setup for FedBalance Method ‣ A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> where the x-axis represents the federated rounds, and the y-axis represents the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the global model.</p>

Although, from the 17th to 19th federated round, FedSGD has better mIoU than FedSGD+Bal. The performance improvement for FedProx+Bal is significant for FedProx, due to the utilization of the left out workers in the global model. It is also visible that baseline methods have severe uncertainty (more spikes), whereas our method has comparatively consistent performance throughout the federated rounds. The main reason behind this consistency is the relevant worker selection with a dynamic threshold mechanism.</p>

We plot the difference in every five federated rounds. For the first and fifth federated rounds, the improvement of FedAvg+Bal over FedAvg is not significant. In the 10th federated round, the difference values are all positive, and in the final federated round (20th), we find the highest performance of FedAvg+Bal over FedAvg. We also notice that for two classes per worker distribution, our method constantly outperforms FedAvg. For high intense class distribution (only 1 class per worker), FedAvg+Bal starts to perform well after the 10th round. In the final round, we find that for 3 class distribution FedAvg+Bal has a significant improvement. The main reason behind the less significant performance could be the dynamic threshold mechanism that starts with an average mIoU value (50%) and dynamically change over federated rounds to increase the performance of the global model. After the 10th round, the threshold becomes stable with sufficient relevant workers, and we see performance improvement for the last ten rounds of federated training.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated learning technique has revolutionized distributed machine learning, especially considering data privacy and computational flexibility. Federated learning brings the ML model to the data generation sources that is less expensive and secure than cloud data centers. Although federated learning can overcome security, and cost challenges, the class imbalance issue can degrade the global model’s performance. As such, we focus on reducing the effect of class imbalance at the local level (<span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>tversky loss) while training the model, and the global level (<span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e., </span>relevant worker selection) while aggregating the federated worker.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the empirical evaluation we find that for non-IID setup FedBal demonstrates a consistent performance across the federated rounds. Although, FedBal’s average performance for the non-IID setup is better than FedAvg. For non-IID and unbalanced setup, FedBal outperforms FedAvg, FedProx, and FedSGD respectively in the 20th federated round. In the class imbalance intensity experiment, we find FedBal performs better than FedAvg in the final federated round (20th round) in three of the cases. Although, for high-class imbalance (only one class per worker) intensity FedBal has less significant improvement (0.25%) whereas for low-class imbalance (three class per worker) intensity FedBal shows significant performance improvement (more than 2%).
The ML training parameters (number of epochs, federated rounds, optimizer, batch size) can be tuned in a more granular way to explore the areas of improvement using the FedBal method that is considered as the future work of this research. We plan to develop a custom loss function for the semantic segmentation domain, and enhance our method as a service plugin that can be used on top of any federated learning algorithm to improve the robustness of the ML model.
