<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models that utilize physics in the form of differential equations to address complex problems, including ones that may involve limited data availability. However, tackling solutions of differential equations with oscillations or singular perturbations and shock-like structures becomes challenging for PINNs. Considering these challenges, we designed an efficient wavelet-based PINNs (W-PINNs) model to solve singularly perturbed differential equations. Here, we represent the solution in wavelet space using a family of smooth-compactly supported wavelets. This framework represents the solution of a differential equation with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while still retaining in capturing, identifying, and analyzing the local structure of complex physical phenomena. The architecture allows the training process to search for a solution within wavelet space, making the process faster and more accurate. Further, the proposed model does not rely on automatic differentiations for derivatives involved in differential equations and does not require any prior information regarding the behavior of the solution, such as the location of abrupt features. Thus, through a strategic fusion of wavelets with PINNs, W-PINNs excel at capturing localized nonlinear information, making them well-suited for problems showing abrupt behavior in certain regions, such as singularly perturbed problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed neural network model are demonstrated in various test problems, i.e., highly singularly perturbed nonlinear differential equations, the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN), and Predator-prey interaction models. The proposed design model exhibits impressive comparisons with traditional PINNs and the recently developed wavelet-based PINNs, which use wavelets as an activation function for solving nonlinear differential equations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Singularly perturbed problems (SPPs) can be described using differential equations featuring at least one small parameter, popularly known as the “perturbation parameter(s)”. Specifically, when the parameter is very small (close to zero), the solution exhibits thin transition layers, often adjacent to the boundaries of the domain of interest. Consequently, the solution or its derivatives undergo rapid fluctuations within specific domain areas while maintaining smooth behavior outside these regions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These problems are encountered in various physical systems that simultaneously contain both slow and fast varying components in the fields of science and engineering such as fluid dynamics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, chemical reactors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, financial modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, gas porous electrodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, mathematical biology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, modeling of semiconductor devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and convective heat transfer problems with high Péclet numbers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The numerical solutions of these parameter-dependent problems based on the discretization approaches are impractical since it is affected by the parameter. Further, a large number of mesh points are required to produce sufficiently precise approximations of the actual solution for various perturbation parameter values. Many methods have been developed to address this challenge, such as parameter-uniform, parameter-robust, or uniformly convergent approaches like Fitted Operator Methods (FOMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and Fitted Mesh Methods (FMMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, to address the challenges with meshes, various meshfree methods, such as the moving least squares (MLS) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, element-free Galerkin approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and the local Petrov–Galerkin method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, have been developed to solve SPPs numerically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper concentrates on one such class of methods, which eliminates not only meshes but also has the ability to handle complex geometry and higher-dimensional problems, namely, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
A few of the earliest works on solving differential equations utilizing neural networks were presented by Dissanayake et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and Lagaris et <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Their method required a trial solution that satisfies all boundaries and initial conditions. However, this technique often fails if a problem has complex behavior, and finding appropriate trial solutions for such problems becomes challenging. Later, Raissi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> introduced PINNs, which incorporate initial and boundary conditions into the network’s loss function without considering a trial solution beforehand. Following this work, different types of PINNs, such as variational physics-informed neural networks (VPINN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, gradient-enhanced physics-informed neural networks (GPINN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and extended physics-informed neural networks (XPINN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, enhanced physics-informed neural networks with Augmented Lagrangian relaxation method (AL-PINNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and physics-informed extreme learning machines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, have been developed to enhance the performance of conventional PINN. For more details, see a comprehensive review of PINNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and references therein.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite many significant advantages, PINNs encounter challenges in accurately handling equations with rapid oscillations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. This difficulty arises because the various components in the loss function have varying convergence rates during training. PINNs need to efficiently represent and learn these features that vary significantly across various scales. While existing theories address issues related to isolated rapid changes, using techniques like domain splitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, these approaches can be cumbersome to implement. Furthermore, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> introduced an improved physics-informed neural networks algorithm, which involved some modifications from the approach described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. A singularity term was included in the calculation formula to account for the singularity of the equation. Other approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> in which authors sampled dense training points near high-gradient regions to improve convergence. Motivated by the reviewed research and identified shortcomings, this work proposes a novel modified version of PINNs i.e., wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks (W-PINNs), which exploit the ability of wavelets to address these challenges.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The localization properties of wavelets make them beneficial when analyzing problems with localized features, such as initial or boundary layers, in SPPs. Mallat’s work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and Daubechies’ contributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> lay down the foundational principles of wavelet analysis. Using the Haar wavelet method, Kumar and Deswal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> have developed two-parameter SPPs with Robin boundary conditions. Further, Kumar et al. designed the Haar wavelet-based approximation scheme for singularly perturbed partial integro-differential equations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Then, Ahsan et al. introduced a wavelet collocation method for solving SPPs with integral boundary conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Wavelets excel at capturing nonlinear information within localized regions of the solution. In contrast, neural networks are well-known for learning and modeling global nonlinear relationships. By incorporating wavelets with neural networks, we can potentially leverage the ability of wavelets to extract these localized nonlinearities. This can complement the neural network’s nonlinear learning capability and potentially enhance the overall ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns, possibly improving the accuracy of the network. The incorporation of wavelets into PINNs has been attempted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. However, this paper focuses on wavelets solely as activation functions, with the overall structure of PINNs remains unchanged from its original introduction. Our findings show that this method also fails to approximate SPPs satisfactorily.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we use the wavelet family to represent an approximate solution to the differential equation, and the weight of each family member is optimized using the W-PINN. Unlike previous neural network-based approaches for solving SPPs, this method requires no prior information about the nature of the solution, making it practical and easy to implement. Additionally, the proposed neural architecture significantly reduces training time as it does not rely on automatic differentiation for the derivatives involved in the loss function. We use Mexican hat and Gaussian wavelets for implementation, and their performance is compared with conventional PINNs to validate the efficacy. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy across various singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations examined in this research and establishes it as a robust method for these class problems.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.3" class="ltx_p">We employ W-PINN to obtain an approximate solution, as described above. W-PINN is composed of two parts: a trainable network that predicts coefficients by forming a fully connected network, and a non-trainable network that provides the final approximated solution and its derivatives. Once we have an approximate solution, we get the loss function of the network using the mean square of residuals and the mean square error of the initial and boundary conditions. The schematic diagrams of W-PINN for second-order ODEs and coupled ODEs are shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks (W-PINNs) ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ An efficient wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks for singularly perturbed problems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks (W-PINNs) ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ An efficient wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks for singularly perturbed problems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, respectively. W-PINN requires collocation points spanning all over the domain as a training set and a wavelet matrix and its derivative matrices up to the order of the differential equation in consideration.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the results obtained using the proposed W-PINN method over a handful of SPPs and compare them with the performance of conventional PINNs. For a fair comparison, all network parameters are kept the same for both and are tabulated along with the examples. We utilize the Adam optimizer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, which combines two stochastic gradient descent algorithms: gradient descent with momentum and root mean squared propagation (RMSProp). RMSprop, also known as adaptive gradient descent, adapts the learning rate with iterations. Adam optimizer is memory efficient and is well suited for problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The trainable parameters of networks are initialized using Xavier’s technique or Glorot initialization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, which, in contrast to random initialization, initializes parameters in a suitable range to achieve faster convergence during training. During backpropagation, it maintains gradients within a reasonable range (not too low or high), thereby preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in poor local minima. Besides this, it can also reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, particularly the learning rate. We sampled the training set by Sobol sequencing throughout the domain as we need efficient exploration of the entire input space for a single training set.

In contrast, W-PINN requires about one minute, which is significantly less. One of the reasons is that, as mentioned earlier, W-PINN does not require automatic differentiation for derivatives of the network’s output with respect to input parameters. Another reason for faster convergence is that the wavelet space is more suitable for addressing problems with sharp singularities.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As the performance of a neural network is highly sensitive to the initialization of its parameters, we performed each experiment five times and discussed the best of the five here. We begin with a singularly perturbed linear advection-diffusion ODE, then proceed to nonlinear and coupled nonlinear ODEs. Using one of the nonlinear ODEs, we investigate how the network’s hyperparameters affect its performance and also compare it with the approach proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Finally, we tested W-PINN over the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and predator-prey model.</p>

It implies that a shallow network is incapable of learning the behaviors of the problem, regardless of the number of neurons per layer.

It is redundant to employ a large number of layers and neurons, which results in an increase in computational cost rather than accuracy.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper successfully demonstrated the advantages of W-PINNs over traditional PINNs and PINNs with wavelet activation functions for addressing singularly perturbed problems. The wavelet theory served as the foundation for the development of W-PINN, which combined the learning efficiency of PINN with the localization properties of wavelets (both in scale and space) to capture nonlinear information within localized regions. A limitation of the proposed method is that it will perform adequately when the resolution of the wavelet family is chosen over a specific small interval. A natural extension of this work involves applying it to singularly perturbed partial differential equations. W-PINNs may also prove effective for other problems that exhibit singular behavior, such as fractional differential models, which inherently possess such characteristics.
