<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We tackle the challenge of Visual Question Answering in multi-image setting for the ISVQA dataset. Traditional VQA tasks have focused on a single-image setting where the target answer is generated from a single image. Image set VQA, however, comprises of a set of images and requires finding connection between images, relate the objects across images based on these connections and generate a unified answer. In this report, we work with 4 approaches in a bid to improve the performance on the task. We analyse and compare our results with three baseline models - LXMERT, HME-VideoQA and VisualBERT - and show that our approaches can provide a slight improvement over the baselines. In specific, we try to improve on the spatial awareness of the model and help the model identify color using enhanced pre-training, reduce language dependence using adversarial regularization, and improve counting using regression loss and graph based deduplication. We further delve into an in-depth analysis on the language bias in the ISVQA dataset and show how models trained on ISVQA implicitly learn to associate language more strongly with the final answer.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Image Set Visual Question Answering (ISVQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bansal et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> is the task of answering a question given a set of Images. In this paper we explore the task of ISVQA, identify relevant research challenges and propose well defined strategies inspired by error analysis and thorough investigation of Visual Question Answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> a closely related task. Tasks that combine vision and natural language continue to inspire considerable research at the boundary of computer vision and natural language processing. Since its introduction, VQA has attracted significant attention from the research community as answering natural language questions about images requires understanding a wide range of detailed semantics of an image and how they are referred to in natural language. Furthermore, solving VQA is of practical importance given its utility in assisting visually impaired people. While the problem of ISVQA is quite similar to that of VQA, the former can be significantly more challenging than vanilla VQA since the answer is not necessarily contained within a single image and thus reasoning over objects and concepts in different images becomes paramount for achieving good performance on ISVQA. For example, In Fig <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a model has to find the relationship between the bed in the left image and the mirror in the right, via pillows which are common to both the images.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Image from the ISVQA dataset.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">ISVQA reflects information retrieval from multiple images of relevance but with no obvious continuous correspondences. A model for solving this type of problems has to understand the question, find the connections between different images, use these connections to relate objects across images and generate the answer. ISVQA leads to new research challenges, including: a) How to use natural language to guide scene understanding across multiple views/images. b) How to fuse information from relevant images to reason about relationships among entities. These challenges associated with scene understanding do not exist in single-image VQA settings but frequently happen in the real world. While ISVQA task includes answering questions about images taken at different times (e.g. like in camera trap photography, or images under same story on Facebook/Instagram), images taken at different locations (e.g. security cameras capturing different locations within a store, or pictures of same house on real estate websites), or images taken from different viewpoints (e.g. live sports coverage), we focus on images from multiple views of an environment.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the specific challenges and issues faced while solving the problem proposed in ISVQA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on solving the problem of Image Set Visual Question Answering, apart from the initial ISVQA dataset paper. Initially, we study the LXMERT baseline for ISVQA and discuss where the model lacks. Based on our findings, we focus on the issues of counting, color awareness, spatial awareness, and language dependence, proposing approaches to tackle each of these issues and finally improving the performance over the LXMERT baseline. We also discuss in-depth the problem of language bias in ISVQA, show how it significantly affects a model being trained on the dataset, and demonstrate how our adversarial regularization strategy stops the model from being overconfident in its prediction in the absence of visual modality. We finally call for work on a VQA-CP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Agrawal et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> like dataset for the problem of ISVQA that helps evaluate how ISVQA models will perform in “real-life” setting.</p>

We then analyze the ISVQA dataset and evaluation metrics in section <a href="#S3" title="3 Experimental Setup ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Being a relatively new task, the only available work on ISVQA is the dataset paper. The paper describes 4 baseline architectures and concludes that their Transformer-based architecture - which derives from LXMERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan &amp; Bansal, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> - performs the best. The problem of ISVQA lies somewhere at the intersection of VideoQA and VQA where instead of having a single image (as in VQA) we have multiple images (which is the case with VideoQA), but the images do not form a continuous scene (as is the case with VideoQA). Given the similarity of our problem with Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA), in this section, we discuss existing works in both these fields and use existing methodologies from both of these as our baselines.</p>

The proposed approach utilized the Faster-RCNN model to identify objects of interest in images and a ResNet model to extract vector representations of those objects. The answer is generated using a 2 layer LSTM network where the first layer is referred to as top-down attention layer and the second deals with generating the final output for both image captioning and VQA. The top-down LSTM attention layer involved utilizes a concatenation of word embedding, image embedding and previous time-steps hidden-state of the 2nd layer as input. The hidden-state generated by the top-down attention layer is then fed to the Language LSTM layer which attends to the embeddings of the extracted regions generated by the bottom-up attention model. Finally the output of the Language LSTM layer is used to compute a probability distribution over the vocabulary to generate the caption in the case of Image Captioning and the answer in the case of Visual Question Answering.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works in the field of NLP have brought to light the positive effects of Language Model pre-training on various downstream tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlin et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Peters et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Lample &amp; Conneau, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Taking inspiration from such architectures, recent VQA models adopt a BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlin et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> style of pre-training for Transformer models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vaswani et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Some of these VQA models include: Visual BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, VL-BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Su et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, UNITER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and OSCAR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Using a Transformer with a pre-training objective is a common theme that runs across all of these models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">VisualBERT, which is probably the most simplistic architecture out of the three techniques mentioned, was one of the first VQA architectures to come out with a BERT-like architecture. In an attempt to learn implicit alignments between text and images, the model is trained on 2 pre-training objectives - (1) Masked Language Objective, (2) Sentence Image prediction. While the first objective is completely identical to BERT, the model, in this case, takes as input both the text and the image regions. The second objective, on the other hand, is unique and attempts to answer if the text provided with the image is the image’s true caption. The authors of VisualBERT first pre-train the model on MS-COCO, followed by pre-training on the VQA dataset, finally followed by task-specific fine-tuning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Works using Transformers that came after VisualBERT focus on how to learn better alignments and relationships between text and images. VL-BERT throws away the Sentence Image prediction brought in by VisualBERT and add a Masked Region of Interest Classification task which masks out Region of Interests (RoI) and then asks the model to predict the entity that may have been masked out. This objective helps learn stronger alignments and as a result, helps VL-BERT outperform VisualBERT. To further improve over VL-BERT, UNITER incorporates Image-Text Matching, Word-Region Alignment, Masked Region Feature Regression, Masked Region Classification, and Masked Region Classification with KL-Divergence objectives. OSCAR - which is the current SOTA on VQA 2.0 - outperforms UNITER by further helping image-text alignment using object-tags detected from images while just using Masked Token and Contrastive Loss. Another recent model, LXMERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan &amp; Bansal, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, diverges a bit from the standard Transformer-Encoder architecture and uses an attention based architecture with different initial model segments for both the modalities. The architecture is also pre-trained on various pre-training objectives including Masked LM, Masked Object Precition, Cross-Modality Matching, and Image Question Answering. We use this LXMERT architecture as on of the baselines for ISVQA task as it is easy to directly use this model for our task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to the strong positive effects of transfer learning and pre-training, recent Transformer-based pretrained models outperform the non pretrained RNN-based ones. The Transformer models, though, use the same visual features as the ones used by RNN models which are most commonly extracted using an R-CNN based feature extractor. As a whole, the modern Transformer-based architectures provide a more expressive and elegant solution to the problem of VQA learning from a glut of other information sources using an array of objectives that help the model learn better and more generalizable representations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to image-based VQA, there has been less work done on video-based VQA. In past few years, several video QA datasets have been proposed, e.g. MovieFIB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, MovieQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tapaswi et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, TGIF-QA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jang et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, MarioQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mun et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and TVQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lei et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. TVQA is one of the largest video QA datasets, providing a large video QA dataset built on top of 6 famous TV series containing 152.5K multiple choice questions from 21.8K, 60-90 second long video clips. The image sets in ISVQA dataset are not akin to video frames which are temporally continuous. Also, unlike embodied QA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Das et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, ISVQA does not have an agent interacting with the environment.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> propose a novel Multimodal Fusion based architecture to solve the task of Video QA. The architecture takes as input 2 sets of visual features as appearance features extracted frame by frame using a standard CNN based architecture such as ResNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> or VGG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Simonyan &amp; Zisserman, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and motion features extracted from clips of the video using the C3D<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tran et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> model.

The architecture incorporates an external heterogeneous memory to integrate the two visual features and learn the joint attention. A similar external memory is also implemented for the question features. This helps to understand the global as well as the local context and also helps in multimodal fusion of the text and video modalities.
The multimodal fusion consists of a core LSTM controller which takes the hidden memory of the combined video and question based features as the input. During each iteration, the controller attends to different parts of the video features and question features with temporal attention mechanism, and combines the attended features.</p>

In addition, some of the techniques that we propose including enhanced pre-training and adversarial regularization are novel and have not been previously explored in other related contexts.

The scans are of 2 types 1) Gibson Building and 2) Gibson Room. nuScenes contain outdoor scenes generated by a <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="360^{\circ}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">360</mn><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">∘</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">360</cn><compose id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></compose></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">360^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math> camera mounted on a car in city streets.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the questions phrases contain between 5 and 10 words. Most frequent questions are
about physical properties of objects, and spatial relationships between different entities. The questions can be broadly said to be about the color of objects in the images, relative spatial properties and the count of the objects.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset tries to ensure that there are a significant number of data points which require more than one image to answer a question. This forces the model to learn the entire scene rather than look at just one region of interest. About 7,000 such samples exist in Gibson-Room and about 3,000 in Gibson-Building. In nuScenes only about 1,000 such examples exist but the number of data points which require more than two images is greater than the indoor ones.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given that the questions are multiple-choice, we propose to use VQA-accuracy as the evaluation metric. In the ISVQA setting, each image set has been annotated by 3 annotators. VQA-accuracy for an ISVQA sample is thus, 1 when it is supported by 2 or more annotators, 0.5 when supported by 1 annotator, and 0 otherwise. Human performance using standard accuracy measure was calculated in ISVQA. VQA-accuracy of 91.88% for nuScenes and 88.80% for Gibson was obtained. This makes the task quite challenging and also provides an interesting observation of why the human performance was not close to 100%. In many cases, humans gave a similar answer to the question which although conveyed the same meaning, was not semantically similar to the provided ”true labels”. For example, the answer could be “black and white” but “white and black”, though same would not be considered semantically similar.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the lack of work on ISVQA specific baseline models, we implemented and adapted one Video-QA and two VQA models to work in an ISVQA setting. In specific, we tried: HME-Video VQA, VisualBERT, and LXMERT models as our baselines. The HME-Video VQA and LXMERT baselines have been proposed by the authors of the ISVQA dataset, and our re-implementation of these models on ISVQA yields results in the same domain as has been observed by authors of the dataset.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.3" class="ltx_p">To adapt HME-VideoQA model to ISVQA, we used the images in the set as the frames of the video so that the appearance features could be calculated directly.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Adversarial regularization is the process of marginalizing biases which may be detrimental to performance of a model when evaluated on out of distribution data. The procedure of performing regularization adversarially involves introducing a competing framework which penalize overconfident predictions of the model when data with insufficient information is provided to the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The idea to incorporate adversarial regularization stems from the observations made on the Question only Analysis. A model which captures strong language biases limits its ability to generalize to data which is not observed during training and hence introducing a regularizing component can prove beneficial to improve the performance of the ISVQA baselines discussed in section <a href="#S3.SS5" title="3.5 Multimodal Basline ‣ 3 Experimental Setup ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.5</span></a>. A similar observation to the one made in the Question only BERT baseline is observed in the LXMERT model. Here the LXMERT model which achieves the best result for ISVQA is able to accurately answer questions even when the information from the visual modality is completely removed by zeroing out object features extracted from the RCNN module. The Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.1 Removing Language Dependence using Adversarial Regularization (In-Depth Analysis) ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the result from our experiment on adversarial regularization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The procedure for adversarial regularization involves eliminating features of objects in the image that contain the answer to the question. This is done by parsing the question to identify objects (ex. car, person, truck, etc.) and removing their image feature representation information extracted by the Faster-RCNN module. The training example generated by the above process lacks important information needed to answer the question and hence the model must not be able to predict the correct answer for such an example. Correct answers to such questions might indicate the presence of unwanted biases learnt by the model during training and to eliminate them we reverse the direction of gradient on adversarial examples and add an additional term to the original loss formulation which maximizes the loss on adversarial examples, thus eliminating biases in the process. The equation <a href="#S4.Ex1" title="4.1 Removing Language Dependence using Adversarial Regularization ‣ 4 Proposed Approach ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> shows the formulation of the loss function with an additional loss term for adversarial examples.</p>

The Cross-Entropy (CE) loss obtained on an adversarial example given the ground truth label gives us a measure of the extent to which the model is overconfident in its prediction hence we choose to maximize this loss. Another loss function that we try out is the per class Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss which is used to determine the cumulative loss per class given an adversarial example and we choose to minimize this loss as its magnitude indicates how certain the model is of the predicted answer. Hence a higher value indicates more certainty which corresponds to overconfident predictions.</p>

We try to tackle this, along with the general problem of spatial-awareness (which is pivotal to ISVQA) using enhanced pre-training. Recent works in the field of NLP have focussed on different positional embedding strategies to improve performance with Transformer-based models. While pre-training using novel positional embedding strategies would have been an interesting path to pursue, the computational complexity of the problem would have been difficult to manage within the resources available (LXMERT pre-training took 10 days on 4 Titan Xp). In order to achieve the benefits of having a better spatial and color-awareness, we take advantage of the pre-training strategy used by LXMERT. In particular, we take advantage of the fact that LXMERT’s last 10 epochs of pre-training only take place on the Image Question-Answering task. In order to provide better spatial and color information, we continue pre-training the previously pre-trained LXMERT on artificially created color and position based VQA questions.</p>

For generating position questions, we looked into the left, right, top, and bottom-most objects, found the nearest objects to these objects based on Euclidean distance, and generated artificial question of the form <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">what is below X</span>.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We observe that all the baseline models struggle to perform optimally on the count-based questions. Traditionally, these questions have been susceptible to dataset biases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jabri et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and often require a multi-step process involving object detection, recognition and counting to perform optimally, while also maintaining the generalizability of the model. We propose an improvement on the baseline model by adapting and extending the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> specifically to handle count based questions.
In their work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> propose that simply using soft attention for the VQA task does not help with the objective of counting.

also dealing with the problem of overlapping object regions of interest to reduce double-counting of objects.
The central idea is to create a graph and subsequently an adjacency matrix from these object proposals. Edges of the graph can then be scaled and pruned in a specific way such that a count of the number of underlying objects is found.

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To better understand the bias present in the text dataset and its implications on the model performance, we analyze the distribution of answer categories across each questions and find that colour-based and count-based questions are often dominated by a smaller number of answer categories, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Removing Language Dependence using Adversarial Regularization (In-Depth Analysis) ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. We can see that for count-based questions like <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how many people/cars/pedestrian etc</span>, same 2 answer categories occurred about 75% times (denoted by blue and green stacks), while all the remaining classes accounted for about 25% of the occurrences, thus denoting a high answer bias for count-based questions. Meanwhile, object-based questions like <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">what does the/what are the</span> show a high diversity of answer classes, and thus low text-induced bias. This indicates the presence of bias in the ISVQA dataset and can lead the models learned on this data to not generalize well and under-utilize visual information when answering questions as the information needed to answer the questions can be learnt from just the language modality features. This is further highlighted from Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1 Removing Language Dependence using Adversarial Regularization (In-Depth Analysis) ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> which shows the results for a BERT-based question-only model. We observe that this unimodal model is able to achieve over 52% accuracy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the presence of such biases we introduce a new adversarial regularization formulation. Here we experiment with training the LXMERT model using 2 different regularization loss terms which penalizes overconfident predictions on adversarial examples and to compare the effect of adversarial regularization we utilize the baseline LXMERT model which was trained on both Language and Visual Modalities. Our results presented in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.1 Removing Language Dependence using Adversarial Regularization (In-Depth Analysis) ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> indicate that when visual information is scrubbed (zeroed out) during inference time (but is trained with both Visual and Language modality present) the LXMERT model trained without adversarial regularization is able to obtain considerably high accuracy on the test dataset showing its over reliance on language modality and the presence of bias in the test dataset. However, when the model is trained with adversarial regularization, performance on test set with srubbed out visual information is reduced drastically  37% while little impact is seen when both the visual and text data are provided which indicates that regularized model does not over rely on language biases. We also observe that using the label-wise Binary Cross-Entropy loss is less effective in removing bias when compared to using the Cross-Entropy adversarial loss formulation.</p>

We do not report results on position-specific questions as the aggregator for such questions is not provided in the dataset. These results re-iterate the need to provide better color representations to our model as they can significantly enhance the performance.

The results are obtained on an LXMERT model trained from scratch rather than adopting a pretrained one. Thus the comparison will be done on an LXMERT model without pretraining using base RCNN features. This is done because the input features for the Count based model are changed and thus we cannot adapt a pretrained model as is (and pre-training our model is computationally unfeasible). A slight improvement over the baseline is observed on the overall results whereas Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5.3 Count Aware ISVQA using graph based deduplication ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Analysis on Image Set Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> compares the model performance specifically on count based questions. This shows a clear improvement over the baseline confirming that ’count-aware’ features perform better. The claims made by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> that the soft attention based models generally do not perform well on count based question is proven. This also shows that a graph based modelling of the regions of interest in an image is a good approach to resolve disambiguities and solve the double counting problem especially in datasets such ISVQA where such anomalies are present in abundance.</p>

The results suggest that introducing an additional regression loss is enough to improve accuracy on count-based questions. And additional modifications such as changes in the features extraction process, better attention mechanisms to improve alignment and overall enhancements to the model architecture are required to improve accuracy on count based questions.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we discuss 4 research ideas to improve performance on Image Set Visual Questions Answering and present an in depth analysis for the problem of Language Dependence along with testing 2 different adversarial regularization formalizations. We utilize three established baselines for the task and perform error analysis to provide a strong motivation for our research ideas. Our presented approaches include an enhanced pertaining strategy for the task of ISVQA that incorporates color and spatiality. We then describe ideas to incorporate count awareness in deep learning models for ISVQA. Finally, we discuss an adversarial regularization technique for bias removal technique as we observe the presence of significant bias in both training and testing data. We observe that our proposed approaches are able to improve performance over the LXMERT baseline, with a 0.38% absolute performance increase using our enhanced pre-training strategy. Our count-based models were able to improve performance on count-based questions by 3.8% while enhanced pre-training helped improved the performance on color-based questions by 2.3%. Additionally, our adversarial regularization technique is able to reduce dependence on the language modality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a future work, we suggest the development of a ISVQA dataset with changing priors similar to VQA-CP to study the generalizability of ISVQA models. Furthermore, work needs to be done to improve the performance on count based questions as our experiments reveal that count based questions are particularly harder for Visual Questions Answering models to handle. Finally, our results from the enhanced pre-training model show that incorporating more pre-training objectives that cater to spatial and color-awareness can help improve the performance even further and running such experiments can be worth the computational efforts.</p>
