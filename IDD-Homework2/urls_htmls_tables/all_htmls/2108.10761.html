<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Privacy protection is an ethical issue with broad concern in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Federated learning is a new machine learning paradigm to learn a shared model across users or organisations without direct access to the data. It has great potential to be the next-general AI model training framework that offers privacy protection and therefore has broad implications for the future of digital health and healthcare informatics. Implementing an open innovation framework in the healthcare industry, namely open health, is to enhance innovation and creative capability of health-related organisations by building a next-generation collaborative framework with partner organisations and the research community. In particular, this game-changing collaborative framework offers knowledge sharing from diverse data with a privacy-preserving. This chapter will discuss how federated learning can enable the development of an open health ecosystem with the support of AI. Existing challenges and solutions for federated learning will be discussed.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Using AI techniques to enhance or assist healthcare applications has the potential to improve healthcare efficiency, increase healthcare service outcomes, and benefit human well-being. The recent development of data-driven machine learning and deep learning has demonstrated success in many industry sectors, including healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">reviewShickel2017 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">reviewXiao2018 </a></cite>. However, training a deep learning model usually requires a large number of training samples, which is not always possible with individual health datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Personal health information is considered to be highly sensitive data, as it contains not only diagnostic and healthcare related information but also identifiable details about individuals. From the consumer perspective, data privacy is also one of the public’s critical concerns and data breaches can result in reduced public trust of their data. For these reasons, healthcare data are governed by strict laws and regulations to prevent the risk of re-identification and data breaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Key examples of standards that protect certain health information include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the General Data Projection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">gdpr2016eu </a></cite>. While these standards are necessary for security and privacy purposes, they can make it challenging to share and link healthcare information. This includes sharing information between medical centres, hospitals and governments. As a consequence, valuable data are often confined to individual institutions and are unable to be leveraged for analysis, hindering the application of deep learning in the healthcare context. In order to leverage the value of existing health datasets meanwhile maintaining protection of user privacy, a new deep learning technique is desired for sensitive data especially in the health field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, federated learning (FL) is proposed as a new machine learning paradigm that can learn a global machine learning model without direct access to each contributor’s private data, which can include hospital, device or user data. It aims to build a collaborative training framework where each participant can train a model independently using their data and then collaboratively share this model’s information without releasing the data used to train the model. An optimisation framework still guides the overall learning procedure, and the private data doesn’t need to be centrally collected or shared. The shared information includes the model parameters and gradients. This allows machine learning algorithms to learn from a broad range of datasets which exist at different locations, by essentially ‘de-centralising’ the machine learning process. These features of FL make it uniquely suited for sensitive data, such as healthcare data, where models can be developed without directly sharing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, the setting of FL is highly compatible with a recently popular concept in the industry – Open Innovation. It is defined as “a distributed innovation process based on purposely managed knowledge flow across organisational boundaries” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">chesbrough2014new </a></cite>. While previous approaches to innovation were primarily developed internally by businesses, there is now recognition that an openness to innovation can be valuable, as external involvement brings new knowledge, expertise and ideas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yeung2021 </a></cite>. Some industry sectors (such as open banking) have already taken action to embrace open innovation. However, further work is needed to enable open innovation for the health industry sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kelly2017innovation </a></cite>. The recent development of digital health indicates that the future of healthcare is to provide integrated information support across multiple service providers. However, how to collaboratively use health data in a privacy-preserving way is a critical challenge. FL offers a solution to this challenge by training models without direct access to individual participant’s data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows: Firstly, we will discuss an FL system for open health including the ways the system could be implemented and the principal stakeholders involved. Then, we will describe the key existing challenges in healthcare in relation to data security, privacy and heterogeneity, and provide examples of how FL is addressing these issues. Finally, we will discuss the implications of solving these key health challenges and the benefits this will offer the healthcare industry.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>A Federated Learning System for Open Health</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Open health, which describes an open innovation framework in the healthcare industry, is focused on driving innovation and capability in health through collaborative partnerships between healthcare organisations and researchers. In this framework, there is recognition that good ideas can come from both within and outside an organisation to successfully advance processes and outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dandonoli2013 </a></cite>.There are various forms of open innovation, including crowd-sourcing, organisational partnerships and strategic joint projects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dandonoli2013 </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently healthcare systems around the world are under pressure to improve patient health outcomes while operating within constrained healthcare budgets. There are a number of factors that are threatening healthcare system sustainability including aging populations, increased chronic disease incidence, new medical treatments and technologies, and limited use of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Braithwaite2019 </a></cite>. It is therefore essential to explore avenues, such as FL, that have potential to benefit patient outcomes and the healthcare system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A lack of data sharing has been identified as one of the barriers to innovation in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kelly2017innovation </a></cite>. This is stalling potential progress on patient care delivery, patient outcomes and health data research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kelly2017innovation </a></cite>. Often the data required for training machine learning and deep learning algorithms are not large enough in individual institutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sheller2020fedlearnmed </a></cite>. Additionally, individual institutions can have data with biases that result in models that do not generalise well and perform poorly when applied to other unseen datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sheller2020fedlearnmed </a></cite>. One way to obtain sufficiently large and diverse datasets is resorting to collaboratively learning and developing models that utilise data from various healthcare institutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given the importance of data security and privacy in the healthcare sector, FL offers a way of maintaining patient privacy while also facilitating open health. This is because it encourages collaborative relationships for health research that was previously not possible, thereby driving innovation and improvements in healthcare. Below we expand on this idea by providing an overview of the ways in which FL can be constructed for open health and the key stakeholders that stand to benefit from an FL system.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An FL system can be categorised into two groups: cross-silo and cross-device (as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">reddi2020adaptive </a></cite>). The next-generation intelligent healthcare applications will tackle both cross-device and cross-silo scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The vanilla federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communication </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">konevcny2016federated </a></cite> proposed by Google aims to solve the large-scale machine learning problem in mobile networks and can be categorised as cross-device. It is designed to learn a model across mobile phones without direct access to user’s data. In this case, each mobile phone represents one device or one user that has a limited amount of training data and computational resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The cross-silo FL is designed for knowledge sharing from data across companies, institutions or organisations. Take an industry sector, e.g., banking or healthcare, where different banks or hospitals have data only for their own customers. Due to privacy requirements and laws, hospitals cannot link their data to the data of other hospitals. With cross-silo FL, a shared model can be trained without direct access to each hospital’s data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the digital health area, hospitals, clinics, wearable device providers, government agencies, and individual users record various data in different formats. The survey of federated learning (by Yang et al., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">yang2019federated </a></cite>) aims to solve the cross-silo data sharing problem across different organisations. Devices usually have very limited computing power and training data, and their communication is often limited and unstable. The cross-silo FL has powerful servers in each participant and has a centralised dataset. However, they require much higher data protection criteria, and there are some existing external factors that can impact data sharing, such as competitions and cybersecurity concerns. This demonstrates more work is needed to fully enable cross-silo FL.</p>

In this framework, governments still maintain storage of the data, however, now they can offer other governments and researchers to join in a collaboration so that important research can be undertaken without compromising individual’s private information.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Security and Privacy Challenge for Federated Learning</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we elaborate on the security and privacy problems in FL systems.
FL, intrinsically with a privacy-preserving attribute, plays a significant role in various industry domains that involve sensitive personal data.
In an open healthcare scenario for example, each hospital or medical research center holds sensitive diagnostic data and strictly cannot share this with others, but desire to learn from data across affiliations.
Although the concept is to provide a privacy-preservation capability by allowing the clients to keep the data on local devices, there are still model security and data leakage risks that would hurt both the security of FL system and the data privacy of clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The risks can be regarded as vulnerabilities or weaknesses from multiple aspects associated with the general FL framework. Thus, we provide a list of common vulnerabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">mothukuri2021federated </a></cite> for comprehensive insights.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This problem is even more severe than the security problem when vulnerabilities cause user data leakage, as it weakens the basics of FL that are specifically designed for privacy-preservation across multi-device machine learning. For instance, if the communication data packages between the central server and a local device (i.e., global model and local gradient updates) are intercepted, gradient-based reconstruction attack algorithms can be applied to recover the training data in the local device. In healthcare applications, the leakage data could be patient’s personal or healthcare information, which presents a severe ethical problem that deserves our attention.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, it is advised that we must correctly identify the vulnerabilities of an FL system, and resist unauthorised access to curious or malicious attackers. This will help develop a more secure system by implementing prerequisites for defending loopholes. This is a mandatory step for an FL engineer to check for all possible vulnerabilities and enhance defenses for security and privacy.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As firstly proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan2020backdoor </a></cite>, a new attack paradigm is to insert “backdoors” in the training phase of FL.
The goal is to corrupt the global FL model into a targeted mis-prediction on a specific sub-task, e.g., by forcing an image classifier to misclassify green cars as frogs.
This can be performed by gradually replacing the global model with a malicious model from the attacker.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Usually, a backdoor attack occurs by data poisoning or model poisoning in a compromised malicious, or curious client, where the poisoning is more directional in the backdoor attack to force the global model to misclassify on a specific sub-task. Two types of poisoning include black-box and write-box attacks, and we merely focus on black-box attacks, i.e., data poisoning, since its conditions and configurations are readily satisfied.
Furthermore, even entire model replacement is possible, with two prerequisites that (1) the FL system (i.e., the global system) is about to converge and (2) the adversary has adequate knowledge about the whole system (e.g., number of users and scale of data).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">More recently, edge-case backdoors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020attack </a></cite>, are presented as strong adversarial attack schemes that are hard to detect and avoid.
Specifically, an edge-case backdoor forces the global model to misclassify on seemingly easy examples that are however unlikely to be part of the training, or test data, i.e., located on the tail of the data distribution. And edge-case backdoor would only attack some unusual inference scenarios and only affect small user groups.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This is the most straightforward idea to resist backdoor attacks, and detects abnormal activities and updates from the perspective of the central server. The detection is established by effectively contrasting the updates from thousands of clients with a normal pattern, where the normal pattern can be derived from statistical analysis or expertise. Under the FL framework, backdoor attacks, through either data or model poisoning, will upload abnormal updates (e.g., considerable update step and/or significant deviation from original model), which is well-captured by a sophisticated algorithm, and thus removed from aggregation.

Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2019abnormal </a></cite> discusses how to detect abnormal updates from clients in a federated learning framework.
Furthermore, such defense can also be implemented by auto-encoders or variational auto-encoders, which help to find the malicious client updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">fang2020local </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020learning </a></cite>.

In the following, we mainly focus on the application scenarios of computer vision in federated learning, where the inputs are images or videos. Therefore, the learning-based reconstruction algorithm will begin from a random attack seed that can be a dummy image with the same resolution as that of the local client. Then, we can perform a forward inference given the dummy image and compute a gradient loss by measuring spatial distance between the current gradient w.r.t the model parameters and the actual gradient from the client. Then, we minimize the gradient loss w.r.t the dummy-initialized image to approach actual client private data.
Thereby, the goal of this reconstruction algorithm is to iteratively modify the dummy image and finally approximate the original data in a local device if the gradient loss is converged to be minimal.
In summary, this learning-based reconstruction algorithm fixes the parameters of a neural network model and tries to optimise the dummy-initialized image with regard to the gradient loss. Namely, compared to traditional machine learning, this algorithm takes the model <math id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{w}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">𝕨</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝕨</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.3.m3.1c">\mathbb{w}</annotation></semantics></math> as its input but takes the image as its learnable parameters.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The distance measurement for clustering methods can be of different forms. Apart from L2-distance, there are more sophisticated distance measurements represented in a hierarchical form, which can be leveraged for specific sets of medical data silos. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">sattler2020clustered </a></cite>, geometric properties of the FL loss surface is used for client clustering.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although clustered FL better utilizes the similarity among the users, there are still challenges when performing it in open health. For example, the cluster identities of a hospital or clinic are usually unknown, so it is essential to identify the cluster membership of these data providers first and then optimise each of the cluster models in a distributed setting. To achieve this efficiently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">ghosh2020efficient </a></cite> designs a framework known as Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA) for clustered FL. IFCA alternately estimates the cluster identities and minimises the loss functions so as to allow the model to converge at an exponential rate with a relaxed initialisation requirement.</p>

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2018secure </a></cite> address this limitation of existing FL approaches and utilize transfer learning to provide solutions for the entire feature space under a federation. Their work has formalised the federated transfer learning (FTL) problem in a privacy-preserving setting where all parties are honest-but-curious. Next, they propose an end-to-end method to solve the FTL problem. Compared with non-privacy-preserving transfer learning, the proposed method achieves comparable performance in terms of convergence and accuracy. Moreover, novel privacy preserving techniques, i.e. homomorphic encryption (HE) and secret sharing can be incorporated with learning models, i.e. neural networks, under the proposed FTL framework without much modifications.</p>

Organisations is likely to be more willing to use their data for collaborative research when they can ensure the privacy of their own patient data and are not required to provide copies of their data. Certainly, it will be essential to identify and engage organisations and institutions that are willing to explore the use of FL for healthcare purposes and to have legal and privacy experts who can verify whether methods comply with existing privacy standards and regulations.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has already demonstrated potential to enhance patient care in the healthcare industry. Previous reviews <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">reviewSolares2020 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">reviewShickel2017 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">reviewXiao2018 </a></cite> present numerous applications of deep learning to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and deep learning has also shown success with image data from medical images and tissue samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ker2018 </a></cite>. Despite the potential for deep learning to improve patient care, adoption in the healthcare industry is slow. This is often due to models being developed in single healthcare institutions using single datasets, resulting in a lack of robustness across populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2019federated </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">If healthcare information can be shared with the help of an FL system, this will overcome existing limitations. Healthcare institutions that previously didn’t adopt deep learning due to potential bias issues that can arise from training in single institutions, would now have access to models with better generalisability due to training on larger and more representative populations. Furthermore, smaller institutions which were incapable of building predictive algorithms due to small data sizes, will now have access to risk prediction models. This will provide these institutions with increased functionality that can be used to help improve clinical care.</p>

For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jung2015wearables </a></cite>, data from wearable devices was used to create a fall detection system that could produce emergency alerts so that immediate treatment could be provided to patients.

It has been used for the development of deep learning algorithms to predict mortality, sepsis, future diagnosis and hospital readmissions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hou2020mimic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">Scherpf2019mimic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lin2018mimic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ma2018mimic </a></cite>. All these outcomes have potential to prevent poor health outcomes for patients and provide optimised care at end-of-life. However, MIMIC-III data is from a single healthcare centre and includes only patients that are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the hospital. Therefore many of the predictive models developed on this dataset will not perform equivalently in other health datasets. By using FL, global models can be developed from multiple healthcare institutions that offer improved performance due to training on larger and more diverse health data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2019federated </a></cite>.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The promise of FL to improve patient outcomes has already been demonstrated in the healthcare sector, for both risk prediction and identifying similar patients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Brisimi2018 </a></cite> used an FL framework to develop a prediction model for hospitalisations due to heart diseases based on information in EHRs.

Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">kim2017federated </a></cite> performed computational phenotyping without sharing patient-level data. These examples demonstrate the success of FL compared to typically centralised approaches and its potential in the healthcare industry to improve care of patients.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the current pressure for healthcare systems to enhance sustainability, an FL system is an attractive option. With the use of FL, it is possible to develop more generalisable models that can assist in providing clinical care. More effective and targeted treatment of patients may result in less time spent visiting emergency departments and hospitals, slowed disease progression for chronic disease, and better outcomes sooner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">rieke2020future </a></cite>.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The healthcare activity may produce data with various structure, for example, images from medical imaging, texts on clinic reports, tabular data in hospital’s database, sequential patient journey in healthcare service system, and time series from wearable devices or ICU. Different data structure needs to tackled with different data processing technique. Moreover, the data fusion of multi-modal data is also a common solution to build intelligent healthcare application. To model the complex data of real-world is a practical challenge. This chapter demonstrates the FL framework using image data. However, the discussed problem and solution can be generally applied to a broad scenario with different data structures.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL holds promising potential to enable shared healthcare information, knowledge and expertise between institutions, while preserving privacy of individuals. Although there remain challenges for data security, privacy and heterogeneity, this is an active area of FL research with solutions already being identified. The implications of FL for health are many, including facilitating sharing of healthcare information, increasing adoption of deep learning algorithms that can produce more generalised models, and the development of improved methodologies that are applicable to industries beyond healthcare. Long-term benefits will result from FL-enabled open innovation of health, which will be felt at the participant, patient and healthcare system level.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that FL will help leverage existing health data assets to directly impact patient care and therefore, offers immense opportunity for open innovation in the healthcare sector.</p>
