<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">The decentralized nature of federated learning, that often leverages
the power of edge devices,
makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and security.
The privacy risk
for a peer is that
the model update she computes
on her private data may, when sent to the
model manager, leak information on those private data.
Even more obvious are security attacks,
whereby one or several malicious peers return wrong model updates in order
to disrupt the learning process and lead to a wrong
model being learned.
In this paper we build a federated learning framework that offers
privacy to the participating peers as well as
security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks.
Our framework consists of several protocols
that provide strong privacy to the participating
peers via unlinkable anonymity and that
are rationally sustainable based on the co-utility property.
In other words, no rational party is interested in deviating from
the proposed protocols.
We leverage the notion of co-utility
to build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system
that provides incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols.
Unlike privacy protection via differential privacy, our approach
preserves the values of model updates and hence the accuracy
of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection via
update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect
bad model updates while substantially
reducing the computational overhead compared to
methods based on homomorphic encryption.</p>

is a decentralized machine learning technique
that allows training a model with the collaboration of multiple
peer devices holding private local data sets that include class labels.
This approach
favors privacy because the peers do not need
to upload their private data to a centralized server.
It is also naturally scalable, because
the computational load is split among the peers, which
may be edge devices such as idle smartphones, and thus widely available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, a special peer, which we will call the model manager,
sends an initial model to all peers.
Each peer then computes
a model update by correcting the model so that,
when input the records in the peer’s private data set,
the model’s output
fits the corresponding class attribute labels.
Then the peer
returns the update to the model manager.
The model manager aggregates the updates and distributes
a new model to the peers. A new learning iteration can now start.
Iterations carry on until the models learned in successive iterations
converge.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, as we discuss in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Attacks on federated learning privacy and security ‣ Secure and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Co-Utility" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the decentralized nature of federated learning
makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and security.
Substantial literature has been devoted to the privacy risks
for peers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>: to what extent the model
update returned by a peer
can leak her private data.
Privacy-protection techniques include secure aggregation of updates, which
hides individual updates to the model manager, and distortion of updates
via differential privacy, which may significantly hamper the model’s accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">

whereby one or several malicious peers return wrong model updates in order
to prevent the convergence of the model (Byzantine attack) or cause a wrong

Protection from Byzantine and poisoning attacks requires the model manager to analyze
individual peers’ updates, thereby making privacy-enhancing techniques based on
secure aggregation of updates inadequate.

Our framework consists of several protocols

This makes our protocols robust against security attacks.
Our protocols also provide strong privacy to the participating peers via unlinkable anonymity and without requiring
the aggregation of model updates. In this way, peer updates reach the model manager individually, while
being, at the same time, perfectly accurate. This provides an optimum balance between security, privacy and learning accuracy.</p>

federated deep learning is presented that relies on GANs (Generative
Adversarial Networks).
This attack assumes an attacker that can see and use
internal parameters of the learned model. The attacker participates
as an honest peer in the collaborative learning protocol, but
she tries to extract information about a class of data
she does not own.
To that end,
the attacker builds a GAN locally and crafts gradient updates
before returning them in order to influence other participating
peers to leak more information on their data.
If the attacker is the model manager rather than a peer,
she can do more: the model manager can isolate the shared model
trained by the victim peer. The victim peer’s update trained
on the victim’s data is used to train the model manager’s GAN, that
can eventually re-create the victim’s data.
As explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, not even differential privacy

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whereas we assume that a majority of peers want to
learn a good model, we still need to incentivize rational
peers to abstain from free-riding:
if they find greater utility in deviating from the
federated learning protocol,
they might seriously impair the overall quality of the learned model.
Also, we need a way to stigmatize/recognize malicious peers in order
to mitigate their attacks.
To meet the above purposes, we will use reputation management.
In this section we present a reputation management system
that does not require direct interaction between peers and has
the following interesting properties:
pseudonymity of peers,
decentralization,
resistance
to tampering with reputations,
proper management of new peers
(to discourage whitewashing bad reputations as new identities
and creating fake peers in Sybil attacks)
and low overhead.

As a consequence, there would be only one forwardee, who would know
that the previous peer is the generator of <math id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="U" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1a"><mi id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1.1" xref="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1.1.cmml">U</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1b"><ci id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1.1">𝑈</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmnote14.p1.6.6.m6.1c">U</annotation></semantics></math>. This would break privacy.
Rewarding only the first forwardee avoids this problem
and is a sufficient incentive,
because any forwardee can hope to be the first (due
to the protocol design, a forwardee does not know
whether she receives an update from the generator
or from another forwardee) and thus has a reason
to collaborate.</span></p>

Several protocols have been proposed in the literature
to aggregate HE updates and decrypt the aggregated HE update.
Let us focus on a protocol that minimizes the number of required
messages and the amount of computation (which is the most challenging
benchmark when comparing with our proposed method):
(i) assume a sequence of peers
is defined such that the first peer sends her HE update to the next peer,
who aggregates it with her own HE update and so on;
(ii) after the last peer has aggregated her HE update,
she sends the encrypted update aggregation to the manager,
who can decrypt it to obtain the cleartext update aggregation.
In this protocol, each peer sends only one message per update, just
as in plain federated learning.</p>

The proposal in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> substantially reduces
the communication requirements, but it is still one order of magnitude

In our proposal and thanks to the digital
envelope technique, updates are encrypted using a
symmetric encryption scheme, which does
not expand the plaintext models (save for potential paddings,
which are negligible
for messages of the size we are considering).
Additionally, our messages include the session key
encrypted under the
model manager’s public key, a triple hash of the model, and a signature.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented protocols to improve privacy and security
in federated learning while perfectly preserving the model accuracy.
Our protocols rely on the notion of co-utility,
that is, they are self-enforcing if players are rational.
We use a decentralized reputation management scheme that is itself co-utile
to incentivize peers to adhere to the prescribed protocols.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this way, peers do not need to be honest-but-curious <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">per se</span>:
as long as they are rational they will behave honestly,
and even a minority of malicious peers that
do not respond to the same incentives as the other peers
can be tolerated.
Confidentiality of the peers’ private data is guaranteed by
the unlinkability of updates: when a peer generates an update,
neither the model manager nor
the other peers can identify the update generator.
This way to provide privacy is superior to the
state-of-the-art alternatives:</p>
<ul id="S6.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S6.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p id="S6.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike privacy protection via differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,
our protection mechanism does not alter the value of updates and
hence does not affect the accuracy of the learned model. Furthermore,
our privacy notion based on unlinkability is
also strong.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S6.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S6.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike privacy protection based on update aggregation,
our solution is compatible with punishing the peers that
generate bad updates. Also, our solution entails less
computational overhead than aggregation based on homomorphic
encryption.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Security, <span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> protection against bad updates, is pursued
in our approach via reputation.
Whereas state-of-the-art security countermeasures do nothing
to reduce the number of bad updates that are processed by the model
manager, we address this issue in a way to achieve two
beneficial effects: first, to decrease
the overhead for the model manager and the
peers related to processing, tracing and punishing bad updates;
and, second, to make the (fewer) bad updates processed by the model manager
more identifiable as outliers.
The design of our protocols also renders whitewashing
and Sybil attacks ineffective.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">An interesting avenue for future research is to harden the proposed
protocols so that they can filter out a greater proportion of
bad updates in situations where a substantial share
of the peers are malicious. A possible strategy is for
the model manager to preventatively reject (without
further examination) any update
submitted by a peer whose reputation is less than
the average reputation of peers who submitted updates detected
as bad in the past.
Note that the peer submitting the update
is not the peer having generated it, but as shown
in the experimental section above, the submitter’s and the generator’s
reputations are correlated.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another interesting direction is to incorporate new methods
to detect bad updates that are better suited for
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) private data
than distance-based methods. Most current detection methods
mentioned in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Security ‣ 4 Discussion ‣ Secure and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Co-Utility" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>
are ill-suited when the private data of the different peers
follow very different distributions. In fact, the extremely non-IID
case is challenging for the very notion of federated learning
even if all peers compute their updates honestly: converging
to an accurate model is more difficult than in the IID case.</p>
