<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently emerged federated learning (FL) is an attractive distributed learning framework in which numerous wireless end-user devices can train a global model with the data remained autochthonous. Compared with the traditional machine learning framework that collects user data for centralized storage, which brings huge communication burden and concerns about data privacy, this approach can not only save the network bandwidth but also protect the data privacy. Despite the promising prospect, Byzantine attack, an intractable threat in conventional distributed network, is discovered to be rather efficacious against FL as well. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the state-of-the-art strategies for defending against Byzantine attacks in FL. We first provide a taxonomy for the existing defense solutions according to the techniques they used, followed by an across-the-board comparison and discussion. Then we propose a new Byzantine attack method called weight attack to defeat those defense schemes, and conduct experiments to demonstrate its threat. The results show that existing defense solutions, although abundant, are still far from fully protecting FL. Finally, we indicate possible countermeasures for weight attack, and highlight several challenges and future research directions for mitigating Byzantine attacks in FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Ubiquitous intelligent devices equipped with advanced sensors (<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, smartwatches, environmental monitoring devices) have brought us into the Internet of Things (IoTs) era, which connects the dispersive world into an interconnected system of intelligent networks. To make use of the data generated by these distributed devices, machine learning as a service (MLaaS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is becoming popular to assist users in refining their businesses. However, MLaaS usually needs to collect data from those devices and perform data analysis jobs in a centralized manner, which inevitably incurs two severe problems: high communication cost and privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In IoTs, data is explosively generated every day, uploading all the raw data to a central server will bring a high burden to the bandwidth, especially in the wireless communication network. Besides, end-user devices usually contain a large amount of private information, such as location, identity, personal profiles, <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc. </span>Directly uploading local data to the server will raise great concerns on user privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, recently emerged federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is a new computing paradigm that allows users to collaboratively compute a global machine learning model without revealing their local data. By distributing the model learning process to the end users (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, intelligent devices), FL constructs a global model from user-specific local models, ensuring that the users’ private data never leaves the devices. In this way, the bandwidth cost is significantly reduced and user privacy is well protected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising prospect, recent studies show that FL is highly susceptible to Byzantine attacks, where malicious users can falsify real models or gradients to damage the learning process, or directly poison the training data to make the global model learn the wrong information. Blanchard <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> have shown that just one baleful user can compromise the convergence of the training and damage the performance of the ultimate global model. To address this issue, a mounting number of defense strategies against Byzantine attacks have been proposed to further safeguard FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Although these research efforts have demonstrated their preliminary success in defeating Byzantine attacks, we emphasize that it is still far from practice to provide a full protection for FL. Protecting FL from Byzantine attacks that simultaneously considers the issues including efficiency, privacy, data distribution is an extremely challenging problem in the literature, especially when there still exist unknown attack surface in its standard process. Recently Mothukuri <span id="S1.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presented a comprehensive survey on the security and privacy of federated learning. However, it neither conducted experiments to evaluate existing schemes simultaneously, which is important to give a fair comparison, nor proposed any novel ideas to support its findings on the further work.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In order to clearly demonstrate the vulnerability of existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes, this article first conducts a concise overview where an in-depth taxonomy is provided for the state-of-the-art defense strategies. We divide the existing defense solutions into four categories according to the principals they relied on for anomaly detection, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the distance based solution, the performance based solution, the statistics based solution, and the target optimization based solution. Then a comprehensive comparison is provided in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. After reviewing the literature, we
propose a new kind of Byzantine attack called weight attack to defeat those defense schemes. By making use of the flaw in the existing weight assignment strategy, our attack is much easier to put into practice while enjoying a high attack success rate. We further conduct experiments to validate the threat of our weight attack. Finally, we discuss the possible countermeasures, and highlight several stubborn challenges and future research directions for hardening the security of FL.</p>

After receiving the data from users, the central server iteratively trains a deep neural network (DNN) model until it converges.

However, such training framework can easily lead to the leakage of user privacy, as users’ private data is handed over to a third party.</span></p>

In each iteration, the server first broadcasts a global model to a set of randomly chosen distributed users, each of which will then re-train a local model using their own data. After completing the local training, the users send the update (<span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the local model) to the server for aggregation and generating a new global model.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This kind of defense schemes aims to detect and discard bad or malicious updates by comparing the distances between the updates. The update which is apparently far away from the others is regarded as malicious. These schemes are usually easy to implement .</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Blanchard <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed Krum and its variant, called Multi-Krum. In Krum, the central server chooses only one update that is closest to its neighbors to update the global model, and discards all the other updates, whereas Multi-Krum chooses multiple updates and computes the mean to update the global model. Similar to Multi-Krum, FABA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> aims to remove the outliers in the uploaded gradients by discarding the gradients that are far away from the mean gradient. However, both Multi-Krum and FABA need to know the number of malicious clients in advance, which makes them difficult to be applied to practical applications. To get rid of this limitation, FoolsGold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> uses cosine similarity to identify malicious updates and assigns them a low weight to reduce their impact on the global model. In their viewpoint, the updates from attackers have nearly the same direction, thus the cosine similarities between abnormal updates should be extraordinarily large. Based on this observation, the central server can find an abnormal update and assigns them low weights. Cao <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed Sniper, which utilizes Euclidean distances between local models to construct a graph, based on which a set of updates will be selected for aggregation. The above defenses apply to the scenario where malicious updates are far from each other (<span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, non-sybil case), however, attackers may collude to upload extremely similar or even identical updates to make the attack more covert (<span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, sybil case). In light of this, Wan <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a density-based anomaly algorithm to detect similar updates. Nevertheless, the defense only focuses on the sybil case and ignores the non-sybil case. To deal with both sybil and non-sybil cases simultaneously, Wan <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a two-pronged defense called MAB-RFL, which first discards the updates that are excessively similar in direction through graph theory, aiming to cope with the collusion attack. Then it utilizes principal components analysis (PCA) to extract the key parameters lie in the updates, because benign and malicious updates are easier to distinguish (<span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, through agglomerative clustering) in the new low-dimensional parameter space. In this way, the non-sybil challenge can be settled.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Li <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> leveraged a pre-trained autoencoder to evaluate the performance. For a benign model update, the autoencoder will output a vector that is similar to the input, but an abnormal update will generate a large gap. However, training an autoencoder is time-consuming, and it is difficult to get the training set that includes sufficient benign model updates. In contrast, Zeno <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> only requires a small validation set on the server-side. Specifically, Zeno computes a score for each candidate gradient with the validation set. The score is composed of two parts: the estimated descendant of the loss function, and the magnitude of the update. A higher score of the update implies better performance, indicating a higher probability of being reliable. Nevertheless, Zeno requires the knowledge about the number of attackers. To address this problem, Cao <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a Byzantine-robust distributed gradient algorithm, which can filter out information received from the compromised clients by computing noisy gradient with a small clean dataset. The update whose distance with the noisy gradient satisfies a pre-defined condition will be accepted. However, the defense proposed by Cao <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> heavily relies on the setting of hyper-parameters, which may difficult to find when putting it into practice. In light of this, Cao <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed FLTrust, which utilize ReLU-clipped cosine similarity between each local update and the server update (calculated based on the clean dataset collected by the central server) to allocate trust score for the local update. A reliable update will obtain a high trust score due to its consistency with the golden standard (<span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the server update), while a malicious update will obtain a 0 trust score. The higher the trust score, the greater the weight of the corresponding local update
when aggregation.</p>

Meanwhile, Xie <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed three aggregation rules: geometric median, marginal median, and “mean around median”. The geometric median intends to find a new update that minimizes the summation of the distances between the update and each local update. The marginal median is similar to the coordinate-wise median proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The “mean around median” takes the average of the values near to the median for each dimension of local update to obtain a new global update. However, the scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> needs to call a secure average oracle many times, which incurs expensive computational overhead. In light of this, Pillutla <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed RFA (Robust Aggregation for Federated Learning) by computing the geometric median with a alternating minimization approach, which calls the secure average oracle for only three times. Bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which is modified based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, executes a robust detection algorithm, such as Multi-Krum, before the aggregation with trimmed mean. The experimental results show that Bulyan performs better than using Krum alone. Muñoz-González <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed AFA (Adaptive Federated Averaging), which separately computes the cosine similarity between each local model and the global model, and discards bad models based on the statistical distribution of the median and the average of these cosine similarities. Xie <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> also used trimmed mean as the aggregation rule, and they further proposed a moving-average method, which considers global models in two successive rounds.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above discussion, we know that the distance based defense schemes usually rely on the assumption that the parameter distribution of a malicious attacker is scattered and deviates from the benign ones, so it is only suitable to resist the attacks that generate evident abnormal parameters. For example, the label flipping attack can easily cause significant changes in parameters. However, it is obvious that such defense schemes perform poorly when the attack causes faint changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The performance based defense schemes detect anomalous updates by directly verifying their performance, which is much more reliable than other solutions. For example, Zeno <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is superior to Krum under both the data based attack (<span id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, sign flipping) and the parameter based attack (<span id="S4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, random gradient). However, it relies on a clean auxiliary data set for examination, which hampers its practicability. Besides, scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> has a high time complexity since the time-consuming pre-training is required when using the auto-encoder.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The statistics based defense schemes rely on computing median or mean to evade abnormal parameters, making it only suitable to the situation where the number of malicious users is less than half of the total users, otherwise legitimate updates will be left out when malicious updates dominate. In comparison, the target optimization based defense scheme enjoys a high efficiency. For instance, according to the experimental results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> conducted on the MNIST dataset, the time cost of RSA is around 45s, while Median, Krum, and GeoMed cost about 50s, 62s, and 127s, respectively.</p>

We can see that various defense strategies have already been proposed, each of which has its own merits and demerits, and many tough issues have been discussed in detail, such as non-IID condition, more than 50% attackers, <span id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc. </span>Nevertheless, we emphasize that it is still far from practice to deploy a secure framework for FL in the presence of Byzantine attacks.
<span id="S4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Fully protecting FL that integrally considers the issues including efficiency, data privacy, and data distribution is an extremely challenging problem, especially when there still exist many attack surfaces in its standard process.

<div id="S8.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The success of the weight attack relies on the assumption that the server assigns the weight to updates according to the local training data set size of each client. It enables attackers to arbitrarily claim their workload in the local training by falsely reporting their data set size. Moreover, even if the server has deployed effective detection methods, if any, to discard bad updates generated from the weight attack, the clients may also tend to misbehave (<span id="S8.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, being lazy) since they will finally share the same global model, no matter how many data sets are used for local training or how much computing power are devoted.</p>

<div id="S8.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In light of this, we emphasize that it is of significant importance to design a fair incentive mechanism before putting FL into practice. Apart from the training data set size, more metrics (<span id="S8.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, model quality, computing resources, past behavior) should be included to evaluate the contribution of each client such that they will be fairly rewarded. As a result, each client is incentivized to do correct computations. This can not only discourage the weight attack, but also motivate clients to contribute more resources to speed-up the local training.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S8.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary goal of federated learning is to protect users’ privacy by requiring them to upload local updates instead of their training data. However, recent research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> has shown that deep models will also reveal private information about the training data. Existing defense schemes mainly focus on mitigating Byzantine attacks, but ignore the possible privacy leakage through the updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, it is necessary to consider privacy protection while defending against Byzantine attackers simultaneously. The most straightforward solution is letting the client encrypt local updates before uploading them to the central server, who can carry out a defense scheme to detect anomaly over encrypted data. Then the central server broadcasts the encrypted global model to clients for decryption and proceeds to the next iteration. The main challenge for this method lies in designing a secure computation protocol that can effectively detect anomaly while protecting the privacy of update, without affecting the performance of the final global model at the same time. Cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption or garbled circuit can provide accurate computations over encrypted data, but they will bring a high computation overhead. Other privacy-enhancing techniques like differential privacy, or hardware-based trusted execution environment enjoy a high efficiency, but they may cause loss on the model accuracy or cannot fully protect the private information. A trade-off between efficiency, security, and privacy needs to be carefully considered for specific application scenarios.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S8.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nearly all the existing Byzantine-robust defenses focus on the label sufficiency scenario, where each client is equipped with fully labeled data. In other words, they concentrate on supervised learning tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, clients’ data may be slightly labeled or even totally unlabeled due to the lack of expertise and motivation of the clients to label their own data. Although a few works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> begin to research how to train a high-quality global model in the label deficiency scenario, the security problem is overlooked.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One may expect to directly apply existing defenses to the label deficiency FL scenario, however, this may not work. As we know, one key reason why detecting malicious updates in non-IID scenario is difficult lies in the tremendous differences between benign updates, which makes it intractable to distinguish between benign updates and malicious ones. Worse still, the differences will be amplified in the label deficiency scenario. Because the pseudo-labels generated by the local model may be incorrect, especially in the early iterations, which may be caused by the low-quality of the received global model. On the other hand, one usually sets a confidence threshold to make the pseudo-labels more reliable, so only those highly confident data will be used for training, making the local updates biased.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, shielding FL in label deficiency scenario is challenging and significant. We argue that variance reduction techniques (<span id="S8.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, resampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, grouping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and momentum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>) will be promising to solve the problem, as they have shown splendid performance in coping with the data heterogeneity challenge. By reducing the differences between benign updates, an IID-like distribution can be built, which is more conducive to detecting malicious updates for the server.</p>
