<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider a federated learning model in a wireless system with multiple base stations and inter-cell interference. We apply a differential private scheme to transmit information from users to their corresponding base station during the learning phase. We show the convergence behavior of the learning process by deriving an upper bound on its optimality gap. Furthermore, we define an optimization problem to reduce this upper bound and the total privacy leakage. To find the locally optimal solutions of this problem, we first propose an algorithm that schedules the resource blocks and users. We then extend this scheme to reduce the total privacy leakage by optimizing the differential privacy artificial noise. We apply the solutions of these two procedures as parameters of a federated learning system. In this setting, we assume that each user is equipped with a classifier. Moreover, the communication cells are assumed to have mostly fewer resource blocks than numbers of users. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduler improves the average accuracy of the predictions compared with a random scheduler. Furthermore, its extended version with noise optimizer significantly reduces the amount of privacy leakage.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) systems are expected to play an important role in future mobile communication standards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With increasing applications of ML schemes in wireless systems, new technologies are emerging to enhance the performance of such systems. On the other hand the wireless technology itself can also be deployed to enhance the ML procedures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Among possible candidates, Federated Learning (FL) has been shown to have considerable promise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and has the potential to benefit from wireless communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL solves several issues of centralized ML systems by distributing the learning task among several edge devices. One advantage of using an FL system, which makes it a good fit in a wireless setting, is that edge devices do not need to transmit their local datasets to the server. This reduces the amount of wireless resources that is required for accomplishing the given ML task. Apart from this, the privacy of each edge device is not completely compromised since the server does not have a direct access to the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL schemes operating over wireless networks have
been extensively researched in recent years; see for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the effects of wireless parameters on the FL process. They
derived an upper bound on the optimality gap of the convergence terms and proposed an optimization problem to minimize the upper bound by considering wireless parameters like resource allocation, user scheduling, and packet error rate. Some other works that studied the communication aspects of FL are <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Moreover, FL with several layers of aggregation or with hierarchy has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the training data of each device in FL is not transmitted to the server, yet a function of the local model (query) is still sent to the server. It has been shown that this local model might leak some information about the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. To mitigate this drawback, FL has been extensively studied together with a privacy preserving scheme called Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">DP-based schemes follow the principle of not being adversely affected much by having one’s data used in any analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. This powerful notion is well established and is applied in industry. To realize a DP-based FL system, each edge device adds some artificial noise to its transmitting information. This noise provides a certain amount of privacy depending on the noise power and sensitivity of the query function.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">DP based FL and its convergence behavior have been extensively studied; see for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In this regard, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> addresses the privacy implementation challenges through a combination of zero-concentrated
differential privacy, local gradient perturbation and secure aggregation.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> considers the resource allocation and user scheduling to minimize the FL training delay under the constraint of performance and DP requirements. Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> presents a closed-form global loss and privacy leakage of a DP-based FL system and then minimizes the loss and privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, none of these works consider a joint learning and resource allocation scheme for DP-based FL that considers the effects of inter-cell interference as well.
In this paper, we adapt the framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and consider a wireless FL system in a multiple base station scenario. Additionally, we consider DP noise added to the gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and combine this approach with resource scheduling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of the FL system here is to train a global model for a given predictor. We introduce an iterative DP-based FL scheme with two levels of aggregation (Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) and then derive an upper bound on the optimality gap of its convergence terms (Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ III Convergence Analysis ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We then propose an optimization problem whose goal is to improve the convergence of the upper bound on the optimality gap of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and simultaneously reduce the total privacy leakage. In this regard, the optimization problem is with respect to certain variables like user and resource scheduling, uplink transmit powers, and the amount of DP noise that is applied by each user to its transmitting information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Since the proposed optimization problem is a non-linear multi-variable mixed integer programming, we divide it into two simpler schemes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">First, we present a suboptimal approach to minimize the objective function only with respect to resource scheduling variables in a sequential manner, i.e., cell by cell. This reduces the original problem to a linear integer programming task and substantially simplifies the implementation. We call this scheme also the optimal scheduler (OptSched). Since this approach performs sequentially from one cell to another one, the amounts of optimal transmit power should be adjusted carefully due to the effects of inter-cell interference. To tackle this problem, we introduce a procedure to determine the users’ optimal transmit powers by solving a simple optimization problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we enhance the OptSched scheme by further minimizing the objective function of the proposed optimization problem with respect to the DP noise. This leads us to a convex optimization problem with respect to the DP noise standard deviations. We call this extended scheme the optimal scheduler with DP optimizer (OptSched+DP).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p">We present all the numerical optimizations and benchmarking results. In this regard, we apply Python optimization packages like CVXPY, CVXOPT, GLPK, and ECOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. The numerical results show that our proposed schemes (OptSched and OptSched+DP) reduce the objective function of the optimization task substantially compared with the case in which we randomly allocate the resources and apply the DP noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we apply these (sub-)optimal parameters to our iterative learning scheme (Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In this regard, each user is equipped with a fully connected multi-layer neural network as a classifier. Furthermore, we assume that communication cells have mainly more users than available resource blocks. This is a legitimate assumption due to the bandwidth limitation. We then perform simulations to measure the accuracy, loss, and the amount of the privacy leakage in such a system for the proposed algorithms. To realize the simulations, we apply the TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib packages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p15" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p15.1" class="ltx_p">The simulations show that the OptSched scheme predominantly improves the classification accuracy by scheduling the users who have larger data chunks and better uplink channels. The OptSched+DP scheme, on the other hand, achieves a significant reduction in privacy leakage of individual users by systematically adjusting the DP noise power and moderately sacrificing accuracy.</p>

Nevertheless, the drawback of this approach is that it is performed sequentially and cell by cell. As a result, there is no guarantee that this approach always provides us with an optimal solution. However, as we will see in Subsection <a href="#S6.SS1" title="VI-A Optimization Problems ‣ VI Simulations and Numerical Solutions ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-A</span></span></a>, it delivers very good results compared with the randomized scheduler.

The edge devices are then assigned to their nearest base stations according to their random position. Based on their distances to the base stations, their fading channels are then computed by applying (<a href="#S4.E17" title="Equation 17 ‣ IV Learning over Wireless Channels with Inter-cell Interference ‣ On Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Wireless Systems with Multiple Base Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>).</p>
