<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Under the organization of the base station (BS), wireless federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple devices.
However, the BS is merely responsible for aggregating local updates during the training process, which incurs a waste of the computational resource at the BS.
To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) paradigm to leverage the computing capabilities of both the BS and devices for a hybrid implementation of centralized learning (CL) and FL.
Specifically, each device sends both local gradients and data samples to the BS for training a shared global model.
To improve communication efficiency over the same time-frequency resources, we integrate over-the-air computation for aggregation and non-orthogonal multiple access for transmission by designing a novel transceiver structure.
To gain deep insights, we conduct convergence analysis by deriving a closed-form optimality gap for SemiFL and extend the result to two extra cases.
In the first case, the BS uses all accumulated data samples to calculate the CL gradient, while a decreasing learning rate is adopted in the second case.
Our analytical results capture the destructive effect of wireless communication and show that both FL and CL are special cases of SemiFL.
Then, we formulate a non-convex problem to reduce the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmit power and receive beamformers.
Accordingly, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this intractable problem, in which we provide the closed-form solutions to the beamformers.
Extensive simulation results on two real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical analysis, and show that the proposed SemiFL outperforms conventional FL and achieves <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3.2\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3.2</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">3.2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">3.2\%</annotation></semantics></math> accuracy gain on the MNIST dataset compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a thriving distributed learning framework, wireless federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients (e.g., devices) to collaboratively train a shared model by iteratively exchanging their local updates (e.g., model parameters or gradients) with the parameter server (e.g., the base station (BS)) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Compared to centralized learning (CL), FL features data privacy preservation, reduced communication cost, and fast inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
However, in the conventional FL paradigm, only the distributed computational resources of local devices are utilized to complete the model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The powerful computing capability at the BS is insufficiently involved in the learning task.
This raises an intuitive problem: <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to exploit the underutilized computational resource at the BS to improve the performance of FL</span>?
To solve this problem, one potential strategy is to provide the BS with some data samples from devices so that its computational resources can be utilized to further promote the model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from how to compute model, another critic issue of FL is how to transmit local updates in wireless networks.
In the literature, there are three commonly adopted wireless communication schemes for transmitting local updates from devices to the BS, including orthogonal multiple access (OMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, in OMA-based FL schemes, each device occupies a dedicated resource block in the time or frequency domain to avoid interference.
However, the transmission bandwidth or time of OMA decreases with the number of devices, which results in a higher communication latency and thus taking more time to reach the global convergence.
By allowing all devices to share the resource block, NOMA-based FL schemes are beneficial to support massive connectivity and improve the throughput <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, thus accelerating the training speed.
However, the co-channel interference introduced by NOMA brings new challenges for the transceiver design and signal decoding.
For instance, if the transmit power of local devices is improperly allocated, it will increase the inter-device interference when the BS decodes individual signals, and even prevent the BS from decoding the signals correctly, thereby reducing the achievable data rate of uplink transmissions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that both OMA- and NOMA-based schemes are communication-centric paradigms, which do not directly match the model aggregation process of FL tasks.
Recently, by aggregating local updates based on the superposition property of the wireless channel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, AirComp-based FL schemes have drawn considerable attention for their unique advantages, such as exploiting interference for computation and reducing latency.
As mentioned previously, in order to make full use of the computing resources of the BS, local devices can upload some data samples to the BS while uploading the local updates.
However, AirComp-based schemes mainly focus on function computation instead of decoding individual data streams, which makes it impossible for devices to simultaneously upload data samples and local updates in a spectrum-efficient manner.
This raises a challenging problem: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to design a spectral-efficient joint communication and computation (JCC) scheme that supports the concurrent uplink transmission of data samples and local updates using the shared time-frequency resources</span>?
Intuitively, one can directly incorporate communication-efficient NOMA and computation-efficient AirComp into a harmonized multiple access scheme so that their respective advantages can be sufficiently leveraged.
Nevertheless, the transceiver structure for supporting such an integrated scheme needs to be meticulously designed to mitigate the severe co-channel interference.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">When addressing the aforementioned problems, we encounter the following challenges.
First, although utilizing the computing capability of the BS for model training is expected to accelerate the convergence, the involvement of the BS complicates the convergence analysis of the training process due to the need of rigorous mathematical knowledge and skillful derivations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Second, since both the datasets and local updates are transmitted over the non-ideal wireless channels, their impacts on the convergence should also be quantified precisely <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Third, existing resource allocation schemes designed for conventional communication of FL systems are not applicable to the collaborative learning framework requiring the concurrent transmission of data samples and local updates.
Therefore, it is imperative to develop new transceiver control algorithms that can further improve both the communication efficiency and learning performance of the considered new learning framework.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To leverage the underutilized computing resources at the BS for improving learning performance, we propose a novel semi-federated learning (SemiFL) paradigm by integrating the conventional CL and FL into a two-tier framework.
Since many previous studies on FL solely focus on transmitting local gradients, the existing communication strategies can not directly satisfy the requirement of SemiFL for collecting both local gradients and data samples.
To address this issue, we propose a novel JCC scheme to guarantee the unique communication request of SemiFL in an efficient manner.
Specifically, at the devices, we combine AirComp and NOMA techniques to enable the concurrent transmission of data samples and local gradients.
To gain deep insights into SemiFL, we provide the theoretical analysis of SemiFL.
Then, we formulate an optimality gap minimization problem by optimizing the transceivers.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the learning performance of existing FL, we propose a harmonized SemiFL framework to orchestrates CL and FL into a two-tier architecture.
The global model at the BS is updated by the hybrid gradient obtained from both CL and FL.
Different from conventional communication strategies for FL, we design a learning-centric JCC transceiver structure to meet the unique transmission requirement of SemiFL.
At the transmitter, the devices concurrently transmit local gradients and data samples via a shared multiple access channel.
At the receiver, the BS first decodes the data samples for CL, and then aggregates the local gradients over the air.</p>

We further extend the result to two special cases, where the BS calculates the CL gradient using all accumulated data sample in the first case and adopts a decreasing learning rate in the second case.
By comparing the learning behaviors between SemiFL, FL, and CL, we theoretically prove that SemiFL is a more general learning paradigm than the other two.
To further accelerate the convergence of SemiFL, we formulate a non-convex problem to minimize the optimality gap by designing the transceivers while satisfying the maximum transmit power of devices, the communication latency of data transmission, and the distortion of gradient aggregation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to meet the unique transmission requirement of SemiFL, i.e., the collaborative transmission of local gradients and data samples, we propose a JCC scheme which simultaneously implements AirComp and NOMA in a communication-efficient manner.
To this end, we design a novel transceiver structure for supporting the combination of these two critical techniques, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A SemiFL Framework ‣ II System Model ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Specifically, the devices transmit both local gradients and data samples over the same time-frequency resources, while the BS first decodes the data samples, and then aggregates the local gradients over the air.</p>

i) the BS configures the aggregation beamformer as a minimum MSE (MMSE) receiver <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>;
ii) devices employ uniform-forcing (UF) transmitters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>;

This is because SCA circumvents the performance loss due to matrix approximation and decomposition.
Additionally, EGC even dissatisfies the rate request because of the static configuration property.</p>

It can be observed that Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> significantly outperforms MATP and ETP by achieving a lower cumulative objective value, thereby implying a smaller convergence optimality gap.
This is attributed to the effectiveness of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in adapting the transmit power of devices to varying channel conditions synthetically, which achieves better aggregation of local gradients for a reduced optimality gap.</p>

It is worth mentioning that all schemes use the same number of data samples in each round to guarantee the fairness.
It is observed that SemiFL achieves moderate classification accuracy and training loss between FL and CL in both training settings.
This validates that the proposed SemiFL is a more general learning framework than FL and CL, as demonstrated in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2 (Relation between SemiFL, FL, and CL). ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Moreover, it can be seen that higher accuracy and lower loss can be achieved if more data samples are uploaded to the BS for calculating the CL gradient.
The reason is that the detrimental impact of the wireless channel in aggregation is compensated by the increasing data samples for CL.</p>

For comparison fairness, active devices utilize the same batch size as SemiFL devices to train their local models, and the BS employs the gradient descent base on all samples from passive devices.
Despite the higher initial accuracy of HFCL-ICpC due to the local updates in advance, SemiFL eventually outperforms the benchmarks.

In Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-C Classification Experiments on Real-World Datasets ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, it is seen that Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> outperforms other benchmarks by obtaining higher accuracy.
The result verifies the advantage of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in terms of classification accuracy, which is credited to the joint optimization of the transceivers.
It is noteworthy that though Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> significantly outperforms MATP and ETP in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of Communication Metrics ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the superiority in terms of classification accuracy is less pronounced.
This is because the decrease in convergence optimality gap does not correspond strictly to the same degree of increase in accuracy.
Moreover, one can observe from MATP and ETP schemes that simply exhausting all transmit power for transmitting local gradients can result in reduced accuracy.
This is because poor power control aggravates the distortion of the aggregated signal, which reflects the effectiveness of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B Optimizing Decoding Beamformers ‣ IV Transceiver Optimization ‣ Semi-Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Optimization of A Hybrid Learning Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in allocating transmit power again.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed SemiFL, a hybrid learning paradigm in a two-tier framework.
The conventional FL and CL were integrated into a harmonized architecture for improving the learning performance.
To satisfy the distinct transmission requirement of SemiFL, we designed a novel transceiver structure that incorporated NOMA and AirComp to support the JCC principle, which enabled the collaborative uploading of local gradients and data samples.
Then, our theoretical analysis revealed the detrimental effect of poorly configured wireless factors on the convergence of SemiFL, and proved that SemiFL is more general than FL and CL.
In particular, we further extended the convergence analysis to two special cases, and demonstrated that SemiFL over error-free channels could converge to the optimum without any gap once the amount of data samples satisfied specific conditions.
Next, we formulated a non-convex problem to minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmitters and receivers.
To solve the problem, we proposed a two-stage algorithm, where closed-form optimal beamformers were provided.
Experiment results on real-world datasets confirmed the theoretical analysis, and illustrated that SemiFL outperformed FL and state-of-the-art benchmarks in learning performance.
Moreover, the proposed JCC principle validated its advantage by achieving smaller MSE, higher sum rate, and better classification accuracy, compared with classical transceiver configuration schemes.</p>
