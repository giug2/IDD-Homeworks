<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Ischemic heart disease is the highest cause of mortality globally each year. This not only puts a massive strain on the lives of those affected but also on the public healthcare systems. To understand the dynamics of the healthy and unhealthy heart doctors commonly use electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure (BP) readings. These methods are often quite invasive, in particular when continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) readings are taken and not to mention very costly. Using machine learning methods we seek to develop a framework that is capable of inferring ABP from a single optical photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor alone. We train our framework across distributed models and data sources to mimic a large-scale distributed collaborative learning experiment that could be implemented across low-cost wearables. Our time series-to-time series generative adversarial network (T2TGAN) is capable of high-quality continuous ABP generation from a PPG signal with a mean error of <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2.54mmHg" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">2.54</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1b" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1c" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">g</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">2.54</cn><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑚</ci><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑚</ci><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.5">𝐻</ci><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.6">𝑔</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">2.54mmHg</annotation></semantics></math> and a standard deviation of <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="23.7mmHg" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">23.7</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1a" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id2.2.m2.1.1.4" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1b" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id2.2.m2.1.1.5" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1c" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="id2.2.m2.1.1.6" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml">g</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1"><times id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><cn type="float" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2">23.7</cn><ci id="id2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑚</ci><ci id="id2.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.4">𝑚</ci><ci id="id2.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.5">𝐻</ci><ci id="id2.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.6">𝑔</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">23.7mmHg</annotation></semantics></math> when estimating mean arterial pressure on a previously unseen, noisy, independent dataset.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Chronic heart disease was the number one cause of death from 2000-2019 according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and was responsible for 16% of the total worldwide deaths in 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Heart disease has also shown the largest increase in deaths during this period. Obtaining unobtrusive continuous measurements of the cardiac state has proven very difficult. The most commonly used indicator for a measurement of the state of the heart is blood pressure (BP) which is often gathered using a sphygmomanometer cuff, finapres, or an arterial catheter. Sphygmomanometers provide spot-measurements for BP over a very short time interval and arterial catheters are an extremely invasive method of continuous BP measurement. The finapres is an alternative for continuous and unobtrusive BP measurement however the size, shape, and price of these devices means that they have not been commoditised for individuals seeking continuous home BP measurement devices. Regular monitoring of BP can prove vital for people suffering from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) who are already vulnerable to BP fluctuations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Methods for non-invasively measuring continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) have been explored that use other physiological signals to infer ABP. One example uses the pulse transit time (PTT) that is the time interval taken for a pulse wave to travel between two arterial sites. PTT varies inversely to BP changes and has been demonstrated to be a valid and accepted measure of BP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. As PTT is defined as the difference in the R-wave interval of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. This information should also be available from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">PPG is an optical technique that requires a single sensor and has become commoditised in the past number of years such that it is included in most wearables and other medical devices. It works by shining a light-emitting diode (LED) into the microvascular tissue and measuring the amount of light reflected/transmitted and absorbed via a photo-sensor and detects the volume changes of blood over the cardiac cycle. The output from this sensor is then conditioned so a valid heart rate can be determined. Having a continuous heart rate measurement means we can extract a PTT measurement also which means that providing further analysis we can extract meaningful ABP measurements using a PPG sensor alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our work described here is part of a larger-scoped effort to develop readily-deployable artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can be easily interpreted by non-expert consumers and downstream end-users. Capitalising on recent advancements in machine learning has the potential to simplify wearables devices, allowing for a reduction in power requirements and subsequently, lower-cost devices as our previous work also aims to achieve <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present our novel framework for implementing continuous ABP measurement using a PPG sensor alone. Our methods seek to use proven cutting-edge machine learning techniques to capture the characteristics that correlate and link continuous PPG to continuous ABP measurements. For the first time, we demonstrate a decentralised learning approach to continuous ABP measurement that is capable of real-world implementation on a large scale and does not compromise patient privacy. This novel approach yields not only a more power-efficient learning framework thus advancing the development of simpler, more cost-effective wearables but does so without compromising the accuracy of ABP measurements and patient privacy.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many works in the past have focused on estimating BP from correlating features available in ECG and PPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These works have demonstrated high-quality results in the estimation of ABP but require domain expertise to process the available PPG signal to acquire the blood pressure estimation. A growing number of machine learning methods are being developed to remove the dependency on signal processing experts allowing for readily-deployable AI systems. Our framework follows suit in automating the signal extraction process, making handcrafted feature selection obsolete.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Slapničar et al. implemented a spectro-temporal deep neural network (DNN) to model the dependencies that exist between PPG and BP waveforms. The authors used a PPG signal along with its first and second derivatives and determined the network successful at modelling the dependent characteristics of BP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. El Hajj and Kyriacou implement recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for estimation of BP from PPG only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Other works develop a statistical feature extraction and selection process followed by a regression-based predictive model, all of which achieve high-quality BP estimation results from PPG data only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Feature-free methods of BP estimation have also been completed previously through the use of a deep-learning-based prediction techniques with good results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, these methods discussed thus far deal with BP prediction in discrete intervals, we build on this through the generation of continuous BP waveforms and BP prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another feature-free deep learning method of non-invasive continuous blood pressure modelling was introduced by Ibtehaz and Rahman <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The authors presented their PPG2ABP method that utilises a deep-supervised U-Net model that consists of an encoder and decoder network adopted for regression. In this configuration, their model can predict a complete continuous BP waveform from a PPG waveform. To build on these works our framework implements a Long short-term memory (LSTM) convolutional neural network (CNN) (LSTM-CNN) GAN model that is capable of generating continuous BP from a given PPG signal. Not only is our model capable of PPG2ABP but also ABP2PPG, this enables our model to infer one physiological time series waveform from another. Our model can map any given time series signal to another but for the transform to make sense the signals should be correlated in some way.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Smartwatches have become pervasive in recent years but are still technically lacking in terms of sensors available to the end-users. Mena et al. developed a mobile system for non-invasive, continuous BP monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Their system actively collected and transmitted PPG readings from a wrist-mounted sensor to a smartphone where BP estimation is computed with machine learning algorithms. Our framework complements and builds on this approach in employing a decentralised multi-user learning framework enabling more accurate predictive models and in-turn faster patient diagnoses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">PPG has become a staple sensor in wearables and the main means of measuring the heart rate of end-users yet from a medical perspective ECG is the proven and more information-rich signal as a measure of the cardiac state. In addressing this issue Sarkar and Etemad <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> present their model CardioGAN that employs an adversarial training method to map PPG to ECG signals. CardioGAN utilises both time and frequency-domain features of the PPG to generate reliable 4-second long ECG signals. Our method implements a time-domain only discriminator to reduce an individual model’s overhead and is capable of generating 10-second long PPG and ABP waveforms from one another. We also take into account the personal data preserving methods and demonstrate real-world applications of such models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing data sharing and privacy issues we adopt a federated learning approach that was originally introduced by Google’s AI Blog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> as a means to collaborate machine learning across mobile devices without the need to store data in a centralised repository. It enables remote devices to learn collaboratively with a shared global-model while keeping their training data on individual devices. The individual client-models train locally and send their weights to be aggregated on the global-model which can then be passed back as updated training weights for the client-models where training can continue. This entire process is known as a communication round. Rasouli et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> presented one of the first examples of implementing this training process as part of a GAN on image and energy data. We implement a similar training strategy for our framework to serve as proof of concept for distributed training across smartwatches to build a model such as the one presented in our paper.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design a Time series to Time series Generative Adversarial Network (T2T-GAN) (Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Estimation of Continuous Blood Pressure from PPG via a Federated Learning Approach." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), based on the popular CycleGAN that is capable of unpaired image-to-image translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The T2T-GAN can translate from one time series modality to another using cycle-consistency losses. More specifically, we implement the T2T-GAN for capturing the complex characteristic relationship between ABP and PPG and train this model to translate a PPG measurement into an accurate continuous ABP measurement. In the interest of data privacy and protection and real-world implementation, we opt for a decentralised learning approach here and implement federated learning. Having one central aggregate model and many decentralised models we can implement our framework without ever needing to handle individuals’ personal sensitive data. Comprehensive details of our method can be found in the section that follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p1.4" class="ltx_p">To successfully evaluate our model we examine the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of generated samples. Using a completely independent test dataset from the training dataset grants us the freedom to implement a leave-one-out strategy and see how well our model generalises to other ABP-PPG datasets. We take the PPG measurements from the test dataset and pass them through our trained global deterministic function; P2A. This function converts our PPG signal to a corresponding ABP signal and we then calculate the MAP from the generated signal and compare it with the true MAP measurements from the real ABP signal. MAP is considered a better indicator of perfusion to vital organs than systolic blood pressure (SBP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. It is important to note that we can retrieve the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from the P2A signal which we use to calculate the MAP (<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3.6 Evaluation ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Estimation of Continuous Blood Pressure from PPG via a Federated Learning Approach." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) rather than simply returning the mean of the continuous signal segment. We also present the Bland-Altman (BA) plots of the MAP error <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> that allow us to determine to what degree the generated ABP is a good substitute for the real ABP.

<p id="S3.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the interest of providing a comprehensive evaluation of our T2TGAN we implement the dynamic time warping (DTW), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithms as distance and similarity measures between the real and generated time series BP sequences for both the federated and un-federated approaches. These metrics allow us to quantify the similarities in structure of the blood pressure waveforms. This is implemented for the entire test dataset (150 minutes, 900 samples at 10 sec/sample) and a random sample of the validation dataset of equal size.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, a qualitative evaluation cannot alone be considered a justification of a successful framework due to the lack of a suitable objective measure. Therefore from a quantitative perspective, we compute DTW, RMSE error, and PCC of the real vs. generated continuous ABP signals. The time series similarity results on the validation and test datasets for both the federated and un-federated frameworks are displayed in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Estimation of Continuous Blood Pressure from PPG via a Federated Learning Approach." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> below.

Our framework performs deceptively well due to the real-world-ness of the test dataset and the fact that, as stated before, the physical state of patients under anesthesia contain marked changes in their cardiovascular variables (ABP and PPG in this case) in comparison to patients in the ICU (training dataset). With further work on cleaning and preprocessing the datasets, we might observe improved results, such as the results observed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, in keeping with noisy real-world data, we did not implement this as part of this work. Overall our framework lays the foundation for continuous ABP measurements on a large scale for the first time by providing a real-world example of how our models learn from small subsets of personal data and generalise seemly well to previously unseen data. All this while using a sole PPG sensor which will subsequently lead to lower-cost devices and commodtisation of such. This may be one such solution for clinicians to remotely and accurately monitor patients’ cardiovascular states in their fight against CVDs.</p>
