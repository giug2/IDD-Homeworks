<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the traditional vehicular network, computing tasks generated by the vehicles are usually uploaded to the cloud for processing. However, since task offloading toward the cloud will cause a large delay, vehicular edge computing (VEC) is introduced to avoid such a problem and improve the whole system performance, where a roadside unit (RSU) with certain computing capability is used to process the data of vehicles as an edge entity. Owing to the privacy and security issues, vehicles are reluctant to upload local data directly to the RSU, and thus federated learning (FL) becomes a promising technology for some machine learning tasks in VEC, where vehicles only need to upload the local model hyperparameters instead of transferring their local data to the nearby RSU.
Furthermore, as vehicles have different local training time due to various sizes of local data and their different computing capabilities, asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is employed to facilitate the RSU to update the global model immediately after receiving a local model to reduce the aggregation delay.
However, in AFL of VEC, different vehicles may have different impact on the global model updating because of their various local training delay, transmission delay and local data sizes.
Also, if there are bad nodes among the vehicles, (that is, the amount of data and local computing resources are small, and the local model is polluted by random noise), it will affect the global aggregation quality at the RSU.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emerging Internet of Vehicles (IoV) becomes a promising technology to make our life more convenient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
At the same time, intelligent services also become a critical part in various vehicles<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, vehicles driving on the road will generate some computing tasks according to the high quality service requirements of users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
However, in the traditional cloud computing, the cloud is far from the moving vehicles, incurring a high task delay when tasks are offloaded to the cloud, which is not suitable for high-speed vehicles.
Thus, vehicular edge computing (VEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is introduced to enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to a roadside unit (RSU) with a certain computing capability to reduce the task processing delay. However, it requires the vehicle to upload local data to the RSU for processing which is a challenging issue because people are reluctant to open their local data due to privacy issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
So the federated learning (FL) is designed to handle this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, FL performs iterative global aggregations at the RSU. In one round, the vehicle first downloads the current global model update from the RSU, and then uses their local data for local training. The trained local model will be uploaded to the RSU. When the RSU receives all the trained local models from vehicles, it will perform the global aggregation and broadcast the updated global model to the vehicles. Then the second round is repeated until the specified number of rounds is reached. Since local data cannot be accessed at RSU, the data privacy can be ensured physically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in conventional FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to offload the local model before updating the global model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. If a vehicle has high local training delay and transmission delay, some vehicles may drive out of the coverage of the RSU and thus cannot participate in the global aggregation.
Thus, asynchronous federated training (AFL) is introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the vehicle uploads the local model after finishing one round of its local training, with which the RSU updates the global model once it receives the local model. This enables a faster update of the global model at the RSU without waiting for other vehicles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The vehicle mobility will cause the time-varying channel conditions and transmission rates<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and thus vehicles have different transmission delays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
At the same time, different vehicles have different time-varying computing resources and different amounts of local data, which will cause different local training delays. In AFL, vehicles upload their local models asynchronously, it is possible that the RSU has already updated the global model according to its received local models but some vehicles had not uploaded its local model yet. As a result, the local model of these vehicles are in staleness. Staleness is related to local training delay and transmission delay. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of the above factors on the accuracy of the global model at the RSU.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In AFL, some bad nodes may exist in the network, that is, the vehicle has small available computing resources, small amount of local data, or the local model is polluted by random noise. The bad nodes can significantly affect the accuracy of the global model at the RSU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, it is necessary to select the vehicles to participate in the global aggregation. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may provide a way to select the proper vehicles to solve this problem<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Specifically, it takes action based on the current state of vehicles, and then gets the corresponding reward. After that, the next state is reached, and the above steps are repeated. Finally, the neural network can provide an optimal policy for the vehicle selection of the system.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first use the DRL algorithm to select the vehicles participating in AFL according to the vehicle’s transmission rate, amount of available computing resources, and the location of vehicle, and then the selected vehicles will train and upload their local models to the RSU.
That is, each selected vehicle can use its local data to train the local model, and then the weight of local model is optimized according to the local training delay and transmission delay.
All selected vehicles can asynchronously upload the local models to the RSU. After multiple rounds of model aggregations, we can get a more accurate global model at the RSU.

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, the simulation tool is python 3.9. Our actor network and critic network are all selected as the DNN with two hidden layers. The two hidden layers have 400 and 300 neurons, respectively.
The exploration noise obeys the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with variation 0.02 and decay-rate 0.15.
We use MNIST dataset to allocate data to vehicles and the computing resources of vehicles obey a truncated Gaussian distribution. Here the unit of the computing resources is CPU-cycles/s.
We configured a vehicle as the bad vehicle, that is, it has small amount of data and computing resources, and the local model is disturbed by random noise.

One can see that when the number of epoches is small, the reward has a large variation. This is due to that the system is learning and optimizing the network in the initial phase, so some explorations (i.e., action) incur poor performance. As the number of epoches increases, the reward gradually becomes stable and smoother. It means that at this time, the system has gradually learned the optimal policy, and the training of the neural network has been close to be completed.</p>

It can be seen that the loss is decreasing as the number of steps increases.
This is attributed to the fact that vehicles are constantly uploading local model to update global model at the RSU, so the global model becomes more accurate.
The sum of delay shows a certain fluctuation,
because of the dynamic available computing resources of the vehicle and its time-varying location.</p>

From the figure one can see that the accuracy of our scheme remains at a good level and gradually increases and finally reaches stability. This indicates that our scheme can effectively remove the bad node in the model training.
Since traditional AFL and FL do not have the function of selecting the vehicles, their accuracy are seriously affected by the bad node, resulting in large fluctuations.</p>

From the figure one can see that the accuracy of all schemes are increasing when the number of step increases and finally become stable. However, our scheme has the highest accuracy among them. This is because our scheme considers the impact of local training delay and transmission delay of vehicles in global model updating.</p>

It shows the delay of FL remains to be high while our scheme keeps a small delay.
This is because FL only starts updating the global model when all local models of selected vehicles are received, whereas in our scheme, RSU is updated every time when it receives a local model uploaded from a vehicle.
At the same time, we can observe that the delay of our scheme appears to rise at first and then fall and rise again. This is because the proposed scheme selects four vehicles to update the global model one by one.
At the same time, owning to the large local computing delay of the vehicles compared to the transmission delay, the local computing delay of the vehicle dominates. In this case, since the vehicle that finishes the earliest local training will update the global model first, the training delay gradually increases. When the four vehicles all update the global model, the vehicles will repeat the above global model updating until reaches the maximum number of step.</p>

At the same time, the accuracy of our scheme is better than that of AFL. This is because our scheme has considered the influence of local computing delay and transmission delay of vehicles.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we considered the vehicle mobility, time-varying channel states, time-varying computing resources of vehicles, different amount of local data of vehicles and the situation of bad node and proposed a DAFL-based framework. The conclusions are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S8.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The accuracy of our scheme is better than traditional AFL and FL. This is due to that our scheme can effectively remove the bad node and thus prevent the global model updating from being affected by bad node.</p>
