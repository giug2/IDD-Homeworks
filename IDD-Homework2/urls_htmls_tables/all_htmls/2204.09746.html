<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">The data heterogeneity across devices and the limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, are two of the main bottlenecks for wireless federated learning (FL).
To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework with partial model aggregation (PMA).
This approach aggregates the lower layers of neural networks, responsible for feature extraction, at the parameter server while keeping the upper layers, responsible for complex pattern recognition, at devices for personalization.
The proposed PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity and reduce the transmitted information in wireless channels.
Then, we derive a convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting to reveal the role of unbalanced data size in the learning performance. On this basis, we maximize the scheduled data size to minimize the global loss function through jointly optimize the device scheduling, bandwidth allocation, computation and communication time division policies with the assistance of Lyapunov optimization.
Our analysis reveals that the optimal time division is achieved when the communication and computation parts of PMA-FL have the same power.
We also develop a bisection method to solve the optimal bandwidth allocation policy and use the set expansion algorithm to address the device scheduling policy.
Compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed PMA-FL improves 3.13% and 11.8% accuracy on two typical datasets with heterogeneous data distribution settings, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10, respectively.
In addition, the proposed joint dynamic device scheduling and resource management approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered benchmarks, but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29% energy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time reduction on the CIFAR-10.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning approach for protecting data privacy.
In FL, edge devices collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a parameter server (PS), which only requires local learning models/gradients instead of local private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
FL operations can be divided into two parts, namely the communication part and the computation part <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
For the communication part, the learning performance is constrained by the limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy.
For the computation part, the model accuracy is degraded by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data samples.
More specifically, the inadequate wireless resources hinder more devices devoted to the FL training process, thus negatively affecting the convergence speed and learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, since the PS aggregates models learned from the different devices, the data heterogeneity presented on different devices may lead to weak generalization ability of the trained global model, even resulting in an unstable training process of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Therefore, FL needs well-designed solutions to address these two challenges.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the communication perspective, efficient resource management and device scheduling schemes can enable additional devices to participate in the FL process and thus enhancing learning performance.
To this end, existing works focus on resource optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, device selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and alternating direction method

The energy-efficient workload partitioning scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> balances the computation between the central processing unit and graphics processing unit in the FL system.
The time-sharing-based transmission scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> can improve the communication efficiency of FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, a sequential transmission scheme has been developed for global model aggregation. Based on this transmission scheme, the authors proposed a device heterogeneity-aware scheduling approach to maximize the number of scheduled data samples under energy constraints.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> introduced an energy-efficient transmission and computation resource allocation approach for energy consumption minimization of FL system under a latency constraint.
The joint device scheduling and resource allocation policy in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> maximizes the model accuracy in latency-constrained FL.
The joint client selection and bandwidth allocation scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> maximizes the scheduled data samples under long-term client energy constraints.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a gradient norm approximation method can assist the device scheduling for boosting the training performance in the over-the-air FL system.
A joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem has been investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to minimize an FL loss function.
Although these works have devised different device scheduling and resource management policies to facilitate FL, the joint optimization of communication and computation in FL has been rarely explored.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the computation perspective, the emerging personalized FL techniques are promising to tackle the data heterogeneity-related challenges, which adapt the collaboratively learned global model for individual clients. Most personalized federated learning techniques involve two steps: 1) devices train a global model in a collaborative fashion, 2) each device personalizes the global model using its private data.
Existing works toward this direction utilize various techniques to implement model personalization in the latter step,
including multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>,
meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and model regularization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. More specifically, it has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> that multi-task learning is a natural choice for building personalized federated models. However, the multi-task FL heavily relies on the full participation of devices in each round.
The federated meta-learning algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> can improve the model accuracy of FL, which maps the meta-training to the federated training process and meta-testing to FL personalization.
A proximal term is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to limit the impact of local updates, achieving convergence stability and improving model generalization.
However, the above techniques require more computation or memory resources than the conventional FL algorithms that solely train a global model, e.g., Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

In addition, the personalized FL algorithms in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> require more computation or memory resources than the conventional weight averaging-based FL algorithms.
Motivated by this, this work aims to devise an efficient FL approach that simultaneously tackles data heterogeneity and communication resource limitations for FL in wireless networks.
Inspired by the success of centralized learning, different learning tasks often share the lower layers of neural networks responsible for feature extraction while the heterogeneity mainly focuses on the upper layers corresponding to complex pattern recognition<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
We propose a novel FL framework that partially aggregates local model parameters of the devices in the learning process to learn a shared feature extractor, while the label predictor part are localized at devices for personalization.
This design effectively improves the learning performance of FL under heterogeneous local data distribution scenarios.
In addition, in view of the devices’ limited wireless resources and energy budget, we devise a joint device scheduling, wireless bandwidth, and computation resources allocation scheme to improve the learning performance of FL in practical wireless networks.

However, the data distributions among different devices in real-world FL systems are often heterogeneous, namely statistical heterogeneity. In the presence of statistical data heterogeneity, the local optimal models may drift significantly from each other, and thus solely optimizing for the global model’s accuracy leads to a poor generalization of each device.</p>

In fact, the convolution layer, linear layer, and some nonlinear activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid and tanh have already proved to be Lipschitz <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, a deep neural network defined by a composition of functions is a Lipschitz neural network if the functions in all layers are Lipschitz. Thus, most neural networks have the Lipschitz continuous gradients.

For the MNIST dataset, we train a MLP, which consists of 4 layers with 550346 parameters in total. The first four layers have 784, 512, 256, and 64 units, respectively. Each of these layers is activated by the ReLU function. The last layer is a 10-unit softmax output layer. For the MLP, the number of FLOPs required to one data sample for gradient calculation is equal to its parameters’ number. In our proposed FL approach, devices only share parameters of the first 2 layers, which has 533504 parameters, accounting for 96.7% of the entire model parameters.

Additionally, compared with the three benchmarks, the proposed approach is less sensitive to the fraction of participating devices in each round. After 40 global rounds, the proposed approach with 10 devices participating in each round can obtain a similar performance as 50 devices participating in each round. The device participating ratio only affects the convergence speed and almost without reducing the final accuracy. However, the benchmarks are sensitive for the fraction of participating devices in each round, especially the training processes of Regularized FL and FedAvg are unstable when the participating ratio of devices is small, like 10 devices.</p>

The performance gain mainly comes from the joint optimization for both computation and wireless resources. In our proposed algorithm, the participating devices can get a trade-off between computation and communication energy consumption, achieving the most energy-efficient learning process. Specifically, the devices with poor channel conditions can boost their CPU frequency for reducing computation time and thus reserve more time for wireless communications. In contrast, devices with good channel conditions can lower the CPU frequency to balance computation and communication energy consumption.</p>

That is, the proposed algorithm is able to get a better performance as the OCEAN algorithm with 12.5% time budget reduction.
The underlying reason is that the joint optimization of computation and communication achieves lower energy consumption than solely considering the optimal communication. Even with less time budget, the balance between computation and communication can also lower the overall energy consumption, enabling more devices to participate in the FL training process in a sustainable way.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have proposed a novel PMA-FL algorithm, which only shares the feature extractor part of neural networks for global aggregation in the learning process while the predictor part of each device is localized for personalization.
This design effectively improves the robustness and performance of the training process, overcoming the data heterogeneity across devices. Experiments show that PMA-FL is able to boost 3.13% and 11.8% accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets compared to the benchmark approaches, respectively.
In addition, we have theoretically analyzed the convergence bound of PMA-FL with a general non-convex loss function setting.
To implement the PMA-FL in resource-limited wireless networks, we have devised a joint device scheduling, communication and computation resource allocation approach to improve the learning performance by achieving the energy consumption balance between communication and computation for each device and the energy consumption-bandwidth balance between devices.
Compared with the considered benchmarks with the same energy and time budgets, PMA-FL obtained around 3% and 2% accuracy improvement on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Moreover, PMA-FL is able to obtain slightly higher accuracy than the benchmarks with 29% energy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time reduction on the CIFAR-10.</p>
