<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">With the development of mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL), a number of studies suggest deploying BCFL on edge servers. In this case, resource-limited edge servers need to serve both mobile devices for their offloading tasks and the BCFL system for model training and blockchain consensus in a cost-efficient manner without sacrificing the service quality to any side. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a resource allocation scheme for edge servers, aiming to provide the optimal services with the minimum cost. Specifically, we first analyze the energy consumed by the MEC and BCFL tasks, and then use the completion time of each task as the service quality constraint. Then, we model the resource allocation challenge into a multivariate, multi-constraint, and convex optimization problem. To solve the problem in a progressive manner, we design two algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous situations with equal and on-demand resource distribution strategies, respectively. The validity of our proposed algorithms is proved via rigorous theoretical analysis.
Through extensive experiments, the convergence and efficiency of our proposed resource allocation schemes are evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the resource allocation dilemma of edge servers for BCFL in MEC.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">AS embedded sensors are widely deployed on mobile devices, such as smartphones and smart vehicles, they can pervasively perceive the physical world and collect an extensive amount of data. With the advances of hardware technology, it becomes promising for devices to process the collected data locally, such as training machine learning models. However, as the resources of mobile devices are usually inadequate, they may experience difficulty finishing computing-intensive tasks, which drives the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC). Its basic idea is to facilitate mobile devices offloading computing tasks to their nearby edge servers with sufficient resources and then obtain the calculated results with communication-efficiency in close proximity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. MEC has been applied to many fields, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and smart transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the main challenges of federated learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, such as the single point of failure and the privacy protection of model updates,
blockchain has been extensively used to assist in achieving full decentralization with security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is termed as Blockchain-based FL (BCFL).
This new framework connects participants in FL, i.e., clients, through blockchain network and requires them to complete both FL and blockchain related operations, such as data collection, model training, and block generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. As for a client in BCFL, a large amount of resources will be consumed in completing the BCFL task, however, making it an impractical job for mobile devices with constrained resources. To address this issue, researchers advocate deploying BCFL at the edge given that edge servers usually have strong computing, communication, and storage capabilities for FL model training and blockchain consensus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this case, the MEC servers are responsible for completing both the BCFL and MEC tasks. For the MEC task, the edge server is usually required to allocate the communication resource (e.g., bandwidth) for mobile devices to transfer data, the storage resource for data caching, and the computing resources (e.g., CPU cycle frequency) for computing based on the received data. Similarly, for the BCFL task, the edge server needs to distribute the bandwidth resource for sharing model updates and reaching consensus among blockchain nodes, the storage resource for saving the copy of blockchain data and local training data, and the CPU resource for FL model training and updating, as well as the generation of new blocks. Since both the MEC and BCFL tasks are time-sensitive and could be performed simultaneously at the MEC servers, the servers have to deal with the challenge of serving both the lower-layer mobile edge devices and the upper-layer BCFL system without significant delay,
which makes it a necessity to design reasonable resource allocation schemes for them.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The existing resource allocation mechanisms for BCFL and MEC can be classified into two main categories, where the first type of studies focus on allocating resources to each device for the requested MEC task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and the other is to allocate resources for model training and block generation in the BCFL task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Although the state-of-the-art studies can help edge servers allocate resources to handling the MEC or BCFL tasks, these mechanisms have never considered the resource conflicts when both tasks are running on servers at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fill the gap, we design a resource allocation scheme that allows the edge server to finish both the MEC and BCFL tasks simultaneously and timely.
Specifically, we define the cost as the total energy consumed by the edge server in completing both the MEC and BCFL tasks, and then use the corresponding time requirements as the constraints on the quality of services provided by the edge server.
We can transform the resource allocation problem into a multivariate, multi-constraint, and convex optimization problem. However, solving this optimization problem faces the following challenges: 1) there are multiple variables since assigning resources to the MEC task means making decisions on resource allocation to each device, where the number of variables increases with the device quantity;
and 2) there are too many constraints, making the solution non-trivial.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">These two challenges result in the invalidity of traditional optimization methods for multiple variable calculation. Therefore, we design a scheme based on a distributed optimization algorithm, named the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is the combination of <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dual ascent</span> and <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dual decomposition</span>, and can determine multiple variables by iterations in a distributed manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. We adopt the ADMM-based algorithm to solve our proposed resource allocation problem in two scenarios progressively for easy understanding. Specifically, we first apply the <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">modified general ADMM</span> (MG-ADMM) algorithm for the homogeneous scenario, which distributes resources to each local device equally; then we propose the <span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">modified consensus ADMM</span> (MC-ADMM) based algorithm to assign resources to devices on demand in the heterogeneous scenario. Besides, by adding additional regularization terms during the variable iteration process, our proposed algorithms can converge in the case of more than two variables, which is confirmed by theoretical analysis. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to testify the convergence and the effectiveness of our proposed resource allocation schemes.</p>

help local devices finish their offloading tasks in the MEC scenario. At the same time, there are multiple edge servers connecting via blockchain network, where they conduct federated learning (FL) to form a blockchain-based FL (BCFL) service provider. In other words, edge servers will be responsible for not only providing computing services to local devices, but also maintaining the BCFL system at the same time.

As for the BCFL system, according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, we consider a fully coupled BCFL which runs FL on a consortium blockchain. First, the clients of FL, i.e., edge servers, train the local models using local data which may be collected from other devices or by themselves, and then they also work as blockchain nodes to generate new blocks which contain the local model updates and the newly updated global model of FL.
For simplicity, we treat the FL and the blockchain jobs together as the BCFL task, consuming computing, communication, and storage resources.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The purpose of our resource allocation mechanism is to allow the edge server to handle both the MEC and BCFL tasks satisfying resource and time constraints with the minimum cost. The edge server should make the decisions about how many CPU cycle frequencies and how much bandwidth should be allocated to each task. Technically, the optimal resource allocation decisions need to consider minimizing the total energy consumption of the edge server.
Thus, we can formulate the decision making challenge of resource allocation into an optimization problem as below:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p7.2" class="ltx_p">It has been proved that when the following two conditions are satisfied, the MG-ADMM algorithm can converge: 1) the objective function is closed, proper, and convex; and 2) the augmented Lagrangian has a saddle point.
We have proved that the objective function is convex, and it is also closed and proper.

First, we initialize four variables and five augmented Lagrangian multipliers (Line 1), and then we update the variables and Lagrange multipliers in an iterative process (Lines 2-17). Specifically, we update variables and Lagrange multipliers (Lines 3-11), and calculate the stopping criteria (Line 12). If the termination condition is satisfied, then the objective function is converged (Lines 13-15). In the end, we calculate the optimal value of the objective function, and then all the optimal decisions and the optimal total energy cost are returned (Lines 18-19).</p>

Thus, the optimization problem in this scenario is more practical and complicated.
In the following, we first introduce modified consensus ADMM (MC-ADMM), which is another form of ADMM. Then we formulate <span id="S4.p1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> based on the MC-ADMM algorithm, and the basic idea is to separate the whole optimization task into multiple subtasks which can be resolved in a distributed manner.</p>

Via comparing the proposed MG-ADMM based algorithm with these three solutions, we plot the experimental results in Fig. <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5.2.1 The Evaluation of the MG-ADMM based Algorithm ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Resource Optimization for Blockchain-based Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing This work is partly supported by the US NSF under grant CNS-2105004.

We can see that the MG-ADMM based algorithm can converge after about 80 rounds of iteration, while random strategy cannot converge. In addition, the random and fixed strategies and G-ADMM can only get the total energy cost larger than that of the MG-ADMM algorithm. The results show that the MG-ADMM based algorithm outperforms the other three strategies.</p>

The reason is that the penalty parameters control the length of the step in each iteration and larger penalty parameters will lead to the greater length of each step, so the convergence speed will be faster.</p>

We can see that the convergence speed will be slower and the optimal value will be larger when the number of local devices increases, which indicates that it will influence not only the convergence speed but also the optimal value of the total energy cost. This is because with more devices involved in the MEC tasks, the edge server will cost more energy to work for the tasks, and the optimization problem will be more difficult, so more time will be cost to converge.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there are many studies focusing on deploying BCFL on the edge servers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors design a BCFL system running on at the edge with edge servers being responsible for collecting and training the local models, where a device selection mechanism and incentive scheme are proposed to facilitate the performance of the crowdsensing.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, resource allocation is one of the crucial but open challenges.
Since the resources of edge servers are usually limited, it is essential to design a resource allocation scheme for edge servers to provide satisfactory services for both the MEC and the BCFL tasks with the minimum cost. Wang <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> design a joint resource allocation mechanism in BCFL, which assists the participants in deciding the proper resources for completing training and mining tasks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, a hybrid blockchain-assisted resource trading system is designed to achieve the decentralization and efficiency for FL in MEC. Li <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> propose a BCFL framework to tackle the security and privacy challenges of FL, where a computing resource allocation mechanism for training and mining is also designed by optimizing the upper bound of the global loss function. One main vulnerability of this scheme is that all participants are assumed to be homogeneous, which is clearly impractical in the mobile scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, none of the existing studies related to the implementation of BCFL in MEC has ever addressed the resource allocation challenge between the MEC tasks and the BCFL task. Because of the dual roles of edge servers in BCFL and MEC, they have to simultaneously finish the upper-layer BCFL task and provide MEC services for the lower-layer mobile devices. To fill this gap, we devise resource allocation schemes for edge servers in the deployment of BCFL at edge to guarantee the service quality to both sides with the minimum cost.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we are the first to address the resource allocation challenge for edge servers when they are required to handle both the BCFL and MEC tasks. We formulate the design of the resource allocation scheme into a convex, multivariate optimization problem with multiple inequity constraints, and then we design two algorithms based on ADMM to solve it in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Solid theoretic analysis is conducted to prove the validity of our proposed solutions, and numerous experiments are carried out to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of the algorithms.</p>
