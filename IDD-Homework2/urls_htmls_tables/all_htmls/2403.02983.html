<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that enables multiple decentralized devices or edge servers to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data. During the training and sharing of model updates between clients and servers, data and models are susceptible to different data-poisoning attacks.</p>
<p id="id6.id2" class="ltx_p">In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The datasets used in this experiment were CIC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and UNSW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> related to computer networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated the experiment with different poisoning percentages.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this modern era of technology, in which other scientific disciplines are advancing swiftly, FL is also keeping pace and progressing rapidly. In the FL setting, a central server collects information from different connected clients regarding their data in a secure manner, such as gradient updates. In this setup, instead of sharing data with a central server, only an updated model is sent or received by a client in the form of gradients or model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Sending data over a network causes data privacy issues and communication overheads. To overcome these challenges, FL techniques allow gradient information to be sent instead of raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, sending model updates over a network can also unknowingly leak sensitive information to a central server or any other third party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. FL has many practical applications and is used in various distributed systems, such as Google’s board <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, to predict the next word while typing. In addition, FL potential applications include sentiment assessment, context-driven points, responding to pedestrian actions in self-driving cars, and foreseeing health incidents such as heart attack susceptibility through wearable gadgets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The wide adaptability of FL across multiple fields has significantly amplified its allure from the perspective of potential threats. While conducting attacks against FL, different threat models are considered, including the objective of the adversary, knowledge of the adversary, and capabilities of the adversary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The objective of an adversary is to violate the integrity and availability of a model. The adversary can have complete knowledge of the global model, also known as the white-box setting, in which the adversary can access the data of all collaborating clients, the global model parameters, and its predictions. However, in a black-box setting, the attacker does not have any information regarding the data or model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In another case, the adversary can have partial knowledge of the FL setting, which means that the attacker can have access only to the local data of compromised clients but not of benign clients<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">In general, attacks in FL can be divided into two categories (i) causative attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and (ii) exploratory attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Causative attacks affect the learning process by controlling training data. These attacks include the injection of training data with erroneous labels, which can reduce the accuracy of the trained model. Typically, these attacks occur prior to model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, exploratory attacks capitalize on misclassifications but do not influence the training procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. There are different kinds of causative attacks that can be carried out against FL such as data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, model poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and many more. These attacks can be classified into various subcategories. There are two types of membership inference attacks: (i) active and (ii) passive. In an active membership inference attack, the attacker could be one of the participants in federated learning who adversarially modifies his parameter uploads <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{t}^{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">W</mi><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">t</mi><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">W_{t}^{i}</annotation></semantics></math> or could be the central aggregator who adversarially modifies the aggregate parameters <math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">W</mi><mi id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">W_{t}</annotation></semantics></math> that he sends to the target participant(s).

Attackers can use both approaches to compromise the clients and servers.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, our main focus was on data poisoning attacks. We implemented two instances of data-poisoning attacks: LF and FP. In LF attacks, the labels of some proportion of the training dataset are flipped so that the attack remains undetectable by humans; for example, if it is 0, then it is changed to 1, and vice versa. By contrast, in FP, we can manipulate some values of the most important columns of the data, and we can use different techniques for it, such as replacing them with the mean or mode of that column.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most importantly, we determined that the LF attack is not effective in FL, specifically in Computer Networks. The reason for this is the drastic drop in the server accuracy from 90% to approximately 10% after applying the LF attack, making it easy for the system to understand that there is an attack. Moreover, the ASR also increased to almost 90%, which makes the attack more suspicious, and we cannot fool the system by applying this attack to the client because the system can easily detect it. On the other hand, the FP attack was successful in fooling the system because there was no major downward transition in the accuracy of the server, whereas the ASR exhibited a radical and significant upward shift, and this attack remained undetectable to the system, making it highly dangerous.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In data poisoning, different types of attacks are used by researchers and adversaries to manipulate data, such as two important data-poisoning attacks, LF and FP. LF attacks have extensive applications in image processing, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> authors evaluated the performance of LF attacks and proposed a defense mechanism on two real datasets from the UCI repository <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>: MNIST<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Spambase<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which are common benchmarks for classification tasks. Furthermore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> the authors used an LF attack to manipulate the MNIST dataset and trained a CNN on a benign and label-poisoned dataset. They found that the attack slightly increased the classification error after injecting ten poisoning points into the training data. The experiment was repeated using the same setting. They used a Multiclass Logistic Regression classifier instead of a CNN and found that the error increased from 2% to 2.1% after a random LF attack. The approach outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> can be readily expanded to encompass a label-specific scenario, where the adversary can adjust the predictions of the victim classifiers based on predetermined rules as opposed to merely generating incorrect predictions. Experiments were repeated on various datasets, including CIFAR-10<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and a reduced version of ImageNet, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Poisoning attacks are extensively employed for model poisoning and data poisoning purposes, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> they used different flavors of state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks such as random LF, random label and FP, label swapping, and FP attacks. Moreover, LF attacks are widely used by researchers owing to their simple nature. This attack was prominent in this study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> in which they carried out it on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. They introduced a small percentage of malicious participants, ranging from 2% to 50%, that contained malicious training data manipulated using an LF attack. For example, in CIFAR-10 image classification, airplane → bird denotes that the airplane image label is changed to a bird. This attack was intended to boost the likelihood of the global model making incorrect classifications, especially by leading to more frequent misclassifications of airplane images as bird images during testing, and they achieved effective results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Label poisoning was introduced in this study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and was generated through GANs and used to train local models. The datasets used were UNSW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and NIMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> which are related to computer networks. Furthermore, they proposed two defense methods to mitigate LF attacks on the FL. In addition to the LF attack, another data-poisoning attack known as the FP attack plays a critical role in FL security. Many datasets have a massive number of features, ranging from hundreds to thousands, and selecting the features to poison is a critical challenge known as feature importance. ML feature selection is also widely used for generalization and has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We have advanced subcategories of data-poisoning attacks that can also be used by attackers in FL, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In this type of attack, the adversary attempts to generate data that closely resembles legitimate data in a collaborative learning environment. However, there are two limitations to this type of attack: the attacker should have background information regarding the victim’s data, and the other requirement is that all members of the class are similar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, another advanced type of data poisoning attack aims to produce perturbed samples in the training data using auto-encoders (AE). An auto-encoder (AE) is a type of neural network that tends to recreate its input data, and adversaries can use it to generate malicious samples for training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In their research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> they demonstrated that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for IoT based on FL are prone to backdoor attacks. In their proposed attack strategy, the threat actor(s) can fool the detection model by employing compromised IoT devices to introduce minimal quantities of poisoned data during the training procedure while remaining undetected throughout the process.
Moreover, researchers are actively working on new defense methodologies to reduce data-poisoning attacks. However, more work is required to make FL systems more robust to these attacks, which also evolve.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we used the two most popular datasets, CIC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and UNSW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> related to computer networks. We trained two DL models on these two datasets separately and captured their accuracy. In this FL setup, we considered just two clients and a server and then also applied two data poisoning attacks, LF and FP to only one client. In DL, an attacker can modify the training dataset based on knowledge and information. According to the currently existing literature, there exist three scenarios that an adversary can consider to conduct adversarial attacks: white-box, gray-box, and black-box attack scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The adversary possesses perfect knowledge (PK) about the training data and model in a <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">white-box</span> setting and can generate adversarial instances for training and modify the model updates. In the case of <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a gray-box</span> scenario, the threat actor has limited knowledge (LK) of the training data and model. The adversary does not know the internal information of the system in a <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">black-box</span> setup, which is a more viable and complex case than the other scenarios. Consequently, the attacker employs recurring inquiries to gather such sensitive data. We carried out this experiment in a <span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">white-box</span> scenario as we had access to both data and model. Additionally, a very simple illustration of our methodology is given in Figure.<a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Methodology ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To examine the effect of adversary capability on models by data poisoning in computer networks, we used the most popular datasets, the CIC<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and the UNSW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that are part of many research works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. We used them to train the model on both benign and malicious examples. Therefore, we used two datasets that are highly related to our research domain. We gathered these datasets in the form of pcap files and then extracted those pcap files using NFStream <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. NFStream employs nDPI-based deep packet inspection to identify encrypted applications and perform metadata fingerprinting accurately. This includes the detection of protocols such as TLS, SSH, DHCP, and HTTP. nDPI stands for "nTop Deep Packet Inspection." It is an open-source library and toolkit used for deep packet network traffic inspection. Deep packet inspection involves analyzing the content of network packets at a granular level to understand the protocols, applications, and services being used on a network. nDPI is commonly used in network monitoring and security applications to classify and analyze network traffic, making it easier to detect and respond to security threats, optimize network performance, and gain insights into network usage patterns.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We trained the clients on both CIC and UNSW and in all scenarios, divided the dataset in this way: 80% of the data for the training and 20% of data for testing and validation. Moreover, each dataset contains around one million data samples. Furthermore, partitioned the training dataset into two segments, allocating one segment to CL1 and the other to CL2. Additionally, subdivided 20% of testing data into two separate sets, distributing 10% for validation and reserving the remaining 10% for testing.
Before giving data to the model, also pre-processed it for efficient results such as filling the missing values with a specified number. If the number is not specified then those values are filled with 0. In addition, during the pre-processing of the data normalization was applied because it gives improved convergence, enhanced model performance, equalized influence, and interpretability because normalized data has consistent scales, that simplify the comparison of feature importance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We adopted a single deep-learning model for both clients during the training and testing phases. Initially, this same model was utilized for our server as well. This model was composed of an input layer, and the number of neurons in this layer is set to the feature size, where feature size represents the number of (Total_Columns-1) in the dataset, and we subtracted one column because one column represents the output label column and is not part of the feature columns. Its number of output neurons was 2048. The model also contains two hidden layers, one of which contains 2048 input neurons, whereas the number of output neurons is 1024, which is the number of input neurons for the next hidden layer. Similarly, there are two output neurons in the second hidden layer, which is equal to the number of output classes. Moreover, the model was also constructed from two activation functions and used the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function named ReLU1, which was applied after the first hidden layer, and ReLU2, which was applied after the second hidden layer. The architecture of the neural network model, named BAU1, can be easily obtained from Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-B Network Architecture ‣ III Methodology ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, batch normalization was applied to both hidden layers. Normalization is performed during pre-processing and can lead to more stable and effective ML models. A dropout layer with a specific dropout probability (<span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">self.dropout_p</span>) is also used as part of the neural network architecture. During training, it randomly deactivates some neurons to increase the network’s proficiency for generalization and diminish overfitting. The output activation function that we used was the log softmax function, which computes the natural logarithm (base e) of softmax probabilities. The cross-entropy loss function is used in this network, which is commonly used for classification problems to compute the loss between the predicted probability distribution and the labels of the true class. The output layer of our model comprises two neurons, and each neuron represents one of the binary classes (0 or 1), where 0 represents the benign class and 1 corresponds to the malicious class.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we performed two data-poisoning attacks on two models that were trained on two different datasets. First, an LF attack was applied. Before performing this attack, we trained the model with a benign dataset and captured the results, saved the models, and tested the accuracy of the saved models using test data. We then poisoned the data by flipping the labels for 1% of the data. Again, the model was trained with malicious data, and the results and models were saved. Here, to compute the <span id="S3.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ASR</span>, we flipped the labels of the complete test data and noted the accuracy that indicates the strength of the attack. We repeated the experiment with 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% poisoned data, documented the results for all these attack percentages, and computed the ASR for all of them.</p>

In the CIC dataset, the <span id="S3.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first column</span> has the highest feature importance, which we computed using permutation on the full model, as shown in Figure. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-D Empirical Study ‣ III Methodology ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Permutation-based feature importance is an approach that involves logically rearranging the values of each feature, analyzing the influence on the performance of the model, and hence determining the impact intensity of each feature in the decision-making step.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p4.5" class="ltx_p">In FP, we manipulated the values of the most important features that were determined using the random forest technique. There were two label classes in both datasets: 0 and 1. We first calculated the <span id="S3.SS4.p4.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mean</span> of all values where the label is 0 and computed the mean of values with label 1. In the next step, we found the minimum and maximum values in the feature column that are different for the two datasets. Subsequently, the values of the most important features were normalized using the <span id="S3.SS4.p4.5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">min-max</span> normalization technique. We changed the values of the column where the label was 0 to random unique values, where the label was 1.

<p id="S3.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, to calculate the ASR, the value of the column where the label was 0 was replaced with the normalized average value of label 1 and vice versa. Because we considered two clients in this experimental setup, we performed both attacks on only one client, which we named CL1. The percentage of attacks was calculated as the number of values to be manipulated according to the desired percentage value. We set up an array containing integer values. In every iteration, if the iterator value is not in that array, then the iterator value is considered a percentage number. This percentage is multiplied by the number of labels in the training data of CL1, which is also equal to the number of samples/rows in the training data. In equation form, it can be written as:</p>

Before, explaining the results of this scenario, there are some common things in all the result tables in all attack scenarios. We set a threshold value for the successful results, which is 0.40, which means that if the server accuracy and ASR are equal to or greater than 0.40, then the attack percentage will be considered a successful case.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-B Results With Label Flipping (LF) Attack on CIC dataset ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> it is clear that the server accuracy drops significantly and the ASR increases; therefore, an LF attack creates a situation of suspiciousness in the system. The losses for client-1 and client-2 were 0.7352 and 0.7361, respectively. With 1% data manipulation, the accuracy of the server was transcribed as 0.0428, whereas the ASR is 0.9564, indicating that the attack failed to fool the server because the accuracy of the server dropped drastically to a very small value and the system could understand it very easily. A similar behavior can be observed with a 2% attack with an accuracy of 0.0537, whereas the ASR is 0.9457, which is also a failure scenario for the LF attack because the attack can no longer act as a ghost in the system and can be detected easily by the system. To further investigate the impact of the LF attack, we increased the attack percentage. We observed new behavior in server accuracy and ASR with 3 % and 4 % attacks. The accuracy of the server with 3% attacks increased to 0.9680, whereas the ASR value dropped to 0.0329, and almost similar results were obtained with a 4% attack. The increase in accuracy is very high, while the ASR value is very low because ASR is not satisfactory in both 3% and 4% of attack cases, and because of the very small ASR values, both cases are considered to fail.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An attack strength of 5% yields interesting results. The accuracy dropped to 0.7739, whereas the ASR increased to 0.2292, which is not a successful scenario according to the threshold. However, detecting the LF attack with this percentage is difficult because the accuracy has not dropped too low, and the ASR showed some improvement. To simplify our experiment, we do not calculate the results for 6%, 8%, or 9%. With 7%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of attacks, we observed similar results, where the accuracy of the server was very low, while ASR had a significantly high value, indicating that these failed percentages of the attack. With 25%, we again observed the opposite behavior, in which the accuracy of the server increased to 0.9204, while ASR decreased to 0.0797; hence, the attack failed with this percentage of attack because of a very small value of ASR.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section discusses various cases of LF attacks on the UNSW dataset. We repeated the experiment with one change in data. Previously, we carried out an LF attack on the CIC dataset; however, we changed the dataset to an UNSW, which is also related to computer networks.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-C Results With Label Flipping (LF) Attack on UNSW dataset ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, starting with a 1% LF attack, the losses of client-1 and client-2 were 0.6791 and 0.6788, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the server with a 1% attack rate was 0.8554, whereas the ASR was only 0.1423. This value of ASR is less than the threshold, which is why we did not consider this percentage of the attack as a successful attack. Although the accuracy was high, the ASR was low. We observed more interesting results with the 2% and 3% attacks. With 2% and 3% LF attacks, the loss of both clients increased to approximately 0.7300, which resulted in a decrease in the server accuracy to approximately 0.1000 and an increase in the ASR to approximately 0.9000. With a sudden drop in accuracy and an immense increase in the ASR, the system will clearly understand that it is under attack, making this case a failed attack. We want to consider only the attack case as a successful attack that gives high values for both the accuracy of the server and the ASR, because we want our attack to act as a ghost in the system. The attack with 4% failed because the ASR value was 0.1917, whereas at 5%, the ASR value increased to 0.7193 and the server accuracy dropped to 0.2815, which also makes it an unsuccessful attack scenario. Attacks of 7%, 10%, and 15% failed because their ASR values were less than 0.1757 in both 7% and 10% and could not cross the threshold value, although the accuracy was greater than 0.8000. In either case, the ASR value is not the desired value. Moreover, the attack was unsuccessful with a 20% LF attack because the ASR value was 0.8212; however, the server accuracy dropped to 0.1795, making it suspicious in the system. However, with 25% attack failure, although the server accuracy was logged at 0.7097, the ASR value was 0.2919, resulting in a failed LF attack percentage. Based on these results, we can conclude that the LF attack does not generate effective outputs and fails to fool the server.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-D Results With Feature Poisoning (FP) Attack on CIC dataset ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a> there are successful cases that show the effectiveness of the FP attack performed with the CIC dataset on one of the two clients in the FL to fool the server. In this scenario, we considered the poison percentages of the attack as successful, in which both the server accuracy and ASR had values greater than the threshold value, which in this case was set to 0.40. We manipulated the values of one feature of the CIC dataset and trained the model on 1% manipulated values of the most important feature columns in the dataset. With 1% poisoned data, we observed that the accuracy of the server was 0.9642 and, more interestingly, the ASR value was 0.9628. The accuracy of the server was also very high along with the ASR value, which means that in this case, our attack worked perfectly because it is unlikely to be detected by the server, and our attack can act as a ghost in the system. As we will discuss only the successful cases in this paragraph, the next case that was able to cross the threshold values was the poisoning of 4% of the feature column values. After training, we tested the accuracy of the server, which was determined as 0.8611. In addition, the ASR for this 4% poisoning case was also transcribed at 0.8616, which is a clear indication of a successful attack scenario, because both values were higher than the threshold. Subsequently, a successful case was observed with 20% values of poisoned data in the feature column, where the accuracy of the server was 0.7427, and the ASR value was reported as 0.7763. The next successful case was with 25% of poisoned values in the feature column of the dataset, and after training when the server was tested, the accuracy reached 0.9680, while the ASR also increased to 0.9671.</p>

With 2% feature-poisoned data, the accuracy of the server dropped to 0.2692, and the ASR value also exhibited a significant decline to 0.2809. Both values are less than the threshold; therefore, they fall under the unsuccessful cases. Additionally, with a 3% FP attack, the server accuracy decreased to 0.0491 and the ASR also decreased to 0.0575, which again fulfills the requirements of the unsuccessful case. Next, such cases were observed with 5%, 7%, 10%, and 15% of the feature-poisoned data, where the accuracy in all cases was less than 0.3500, which is less than the threshold value. Furthermore, the ASR value in these three cases was less than 0.36, which is again less than our threshold. These attack cases cannot fool the server and are easily detected by the system.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section is related to scenarios with a feature-poisoning attack on the UNSW dataset. In Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ IV-E Results With Feature Poisoning (FP) Attack on UNSW dataset ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> we list the successful cases that show the impact of the FP attack on the UNSW dataset. Again, in this scenario, we regarded the poison percentages of the attack as successful, in which the server accuracy and ASR both have values greater than a threshold value, which was set to 0.40. We manipulated the values of one feature of the UNSW dataset and trained the model with 1% of the manipulated values of the most important features in the UNSW dataset. With 1% poisoned data, we observed that the accuracy of the server was 0.8195 and, more interestingly, the ASR value was 0.8232. The accuracy of the server is good, and the ASR is also greater than the threshold value, which means that in this case, our attack worked perfectly because it is difficult to detect by the server, and our attack can act as a ghost in the system. The next case that could cross the threshold value was poisoning of the 2% and 3% values of the feature column. After training, we tested the accuracy of the server, which was above 0.84 in both cases. Additionally, the ASR for the 2% and 3% poisoning cases was also noted to be above 0.81, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ IV-E Results With Feature Poisoning (FP) Attack on UNSW dataset ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> which is a clear indication of successful attack cases because both values are higher than the threshold in both cases. Subsequently, all the poison percentages except 4% were observed to be successful cases. The accuracy and ASR values at 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% poisoning percentages are greater than the threshold; therefore, if we poison the UNSW dataset with these percentages, we can fool the system. 
<br class="ltx_break">There was only one unsuccessful case in this scenario in which the poison percentage was set to 4%, and when the model was trained and tested after manipulating the values according to this percentage of the feature column, we obtained a server accuracy value of 0.0952, while the ASR value was also observed to be 0.1089.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we explored the vulnerability of FL models to data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain. For this purpose, we carried out two data poisoning attacks, LF and FP, on two prominent datasets, CIC and UNSW, which are part of numerous studies in computer networks. We divided the experiments into four different scenarios for both attacks and both datasets, and reported the results in different tables in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Results and Discussion ‣ Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. Our findings provide critical insights into the susceptibility of FL models to adversarial attack. We determined that the LF attack is not an effective approach to fool the server because the accuracy drops significantly, and the system can notice it immediately and raise a critical alert. However, the FP attack showed significantly more effective results and was able to fool the server in most cases in both scenarios. Feature importance analysis revealed that a few features in the dataset can significantly influence the decision-making process of the model. If we successfully find these important features and exploit them, then these vital features in FP attacks require enhanced feature-protection mechanisms.</p>

Studies can focus on feature obfuscation and protection strategies that can reduce the influence of feature-poisoning attacks, including feature-level encryption and feature-perturbation techniques. Moreover, researchers should delve into more sophisticated adversarial strategies, including transfer attacks between models, evasion attacks, and adversarial federated learning, to bolster defense against these evolving threats. By identifying attack vectors and their critical impacts, we can establish a framework for developing more resilient and enduring FL systems and enhancing their capability to face challenging threats in a dynamic cybersecurity environment. In addition, we experimented with two clients; however, in future studies, it can be extended to N clients, where the value of N is greater than 2, and more interesting results can be expected.</p>
