<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">This paper presents an ontology design along with knowledge engineering, and multilingual semantic reasoning techniques to build an automated system for assimilating culinary information for Indian food in the form of a knowledge graph. The main focus is on designing intelligent methods to derive ontology designs and capture all-encompassing knowledge about food, recipes, ingredients, cooking characteristics, and most importantly, nutrition, at scale. We present our ongoing work in this workshop paper, describe in some detail the relevant challenges in curating knowledge of Indian food, and propose our high-level ontology design. We also present a novel workflow that uses AI, LLM, and language technology to curate information from recipe blog sites in the public domain to build knowledge graphs for Indian food. The methods for knowledge curation proposed in this paper are generic and can be replicated for any domain. The design is application-agnostic and can be used for AI-driven smart analysis, building recommendation systems for Personalized Digital Health, and complementing the knowledge graph for Indian food with contextual information such as user information, food biochemistry, geographic information, agricultural information, etc.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Food is playing an increasingly central role in health and sustainability discourses as the preservation of diverse cultures, food security, precision nutrition, personal and public health, agricultural practices, climate impact, and supply chains become focal points of discussion. However, any definitive effort in such a scientific pursuit requires well-founded applications to be designed around food and food-related data, with access to knowledge representation and reasoning systems for food. In this light, food knowledge graphs are crucial and reusable digital resources that can capture various nuances of food including but not limited to recipes, ingredients, flavor, texture, cooking techniques, cuisine, nutritional information, and mealtimes. They can be used for various applications like food recommendation, recipe recommendation, diet planning, health tracking, food quality control, managing food supply chains, and so on. While several countries including the US, parts of Europe (like Latvia, Norway, Spain, the UK, Italy, and Portugal), China, and Japan are working on building such knowledge bases for specific regions, there appears to be a vacuum when it comes to Indian food. We intend to bridge this gap to aid food computing initiatives for Indian food.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">In this paper, we present our work on building a knowledge graph for Indian food, named FKG.in, which aims to exhaustively cover the panorama of Indian food and act as a digital resource for building subsequent food computing applications over it. The proposed ontology adapts from earlier food ontologies along with modifications and extensions to capture unique aspects of Indian food and is designed in an application-agnostic way. We also propose a novel AI-based semi-automated approach to curate culinary information from multiple websites in the public domain to populate the knowledge graph, along with a human-in-the-loop intervention to ensure the soundness of information.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the work done in the areas of designing food ontology and building food knowledge graphs, along with earlier efforts in building Indian food knowledge graphs. Section 3 presents the unique challenges associated with the task of consolidating knowledge about Indian food. Section 4 presents the ontology design and its connections to existing food knowledge graphs. Section 5 presents the AI-based technologies adopted to populate a knowledge base for Indian food. Section 6 presents some results. Finally, we conclude with plans to extend the knowledge graph and integrate it with other food computing applications.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">Several food knowledge graphs have been constructed based on these ontologies and their extensions, to support food computing applications. We mention only a few representative ones here. For a more comprehensive review of food ontology, food knowledge graphs, and food computing applications, one may refer to the works cited in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>, authors have categorized existing food knowledge graphs into four different types - (1) knowledge graphs about recipes, (2) knowledge graphs about nutrients and health, (3) knowledge graphs about food safety, and (4) general food knowledge graphs. We follow the same pattern to group both ontology and knowledge graphs, though there exist many overlaps among the groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">The first group of ontology mostly focuses on concepts of food related to recipes and cooking. Notable in this group are Table <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>, Cooking ontology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite>, BBC food ontology<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote1"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/food-ontology</span></span></span>, and so on. There are a few ontologies dedicated to special categories of food, like Open Food Facts<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote2"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data</span></span></span> that model information about packaged foods, Seafood ontology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>, and so on.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p3.1">Recipe knowledge graphs are built to store recipe entities that are extracted from crowdsourced consumer review sites, recipe-sharing websites, and social media to primarily support food recommendation systems and build social networks around food.

RcpKG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite> is a multimodal and hierarchical food knowledge graph that curates information from popular recipe websites like Yummly and AllRecipes as well as semi-structured datasets like Recipe1M+ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>. RcpKG also incorporates social relationships into the food knowledge graph for generating food recommendations that can take care of both personal preferences and social relationships. In a unique experiment, cooking is viewed as a uniquely human endeavor for transforming raw ingredients into delicious dishes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>, and it is proposed that recipes can be viewed as cultural capsules that capture culinary protocols. This work is focused on learning the valid protocols for a given set of constraints and thereby generating recipes without violating the cooking principles. This work is also envisaged to generate recipes following the culinary grammar that can be leveraged to improve public health through dietary interventions. The underlying knowledge base is RecipeDB<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote3"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/</span></span></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, which is a structured compilation of recipes, and ingredients along with their nutrition and flavor profiles and health associations.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p1.1">The diverse Indian cuisine reflects a history of over 8,000 years, during which the history of various ethnic groups and cultures have interacted with each other in the Indian subcontinent, resulting in a vast variety of cooking techniques, flavors, and regional cuisines. While this diversity has resulted in a rich repertoire of recipes, it has also introduced some unique challenges towards automating the task of building a food knowledge base. We note these and a few other challenges below:</p>
<ol class="ltx_enumerate" id="S3.I1">
<li class="ltx_item" id="S3.I1.i1" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.I1.i1.p1.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.I1.i1.p1.1.1">Lack of a comprehensive vocabulary</span> of food items has necessitated that this work start from almost scratch. This spans all concepts related to food like ingredients, cuisines, styles, cooking processes, cookware, and so on. There exists <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.I1.i1.p1.1.2">a multiplicity of recipes</span> with the same name but different compositions from different regions. To a large extent, this occurs due to regional variations in climate, culture, and availability of ingredients. The most common example of this is <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i1.p1.1.3">dal</span> (lentil soup) which, though an integral part of almost all regional meals, has huge variations across the country. Additionally, as Indian food recipes are often quite complex, capturing the nuances of similar recipes is often a very difficult task.</p>

The same food items have various vernacular names across the country. For example, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.2">haldi</span> (Hindi), <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.3">holud</span> (Bengali), <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.4">halad</span> (Marathi), <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.5">pasupu</span> (Telugu) and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.6">manjal</span> (Tamil), all refer to turmeric in different Indian languages.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.1">Recipe</span> class: At the heart of the proposed food ontology lies the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.2">Recipe</span> class. A <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.3">Recipe</span> instance (or recipe) is composed of measured ingredients, physical and conceptual properties, cooking characteristics, and a set of cooking instructions. Different sets of properties are associated with the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.4">Recipe</span> class. The first set comprises those that have values represented as simple strings like <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.5">name</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.6">cuisine</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.7">serving size</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.8">calories</span>, etc. Secondly, a recipe is characterized by detailed <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.9">cooking instructions</span>, which we store as long text. The third set of properties is composite. For example, a recipe has <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.10">Cooking Characteristics</span>, which is an aggregate class, designed along the lines of a similar class available in FoodKG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>. This contains <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.11">cooking techniques</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.12">cookware</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.13">cooking temperature</span>, etc. Vocabularies to cater to Indian cooking processes, practices, kitchen utensils, etc. have been curated. For a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.14">Recipe</span> instance, while many of these property values may be available from data, some are derived using predefined functions. The most important properties in this set are <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.15">cuisine</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.16">nutritional information</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.17">diet labels</span> and so on. These properties are derived from the ingredients, their measurements, and cooking characteristics using dedicated functions. The property <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.18">pairing information</span> stores names of other recipes that are usually taken with it. For example, &lt;<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.19">chawal</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.20">dal</span>&gt;, &lt;<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.21">idli</span>, (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.22">chutney</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.23">sambar</span>)&gt;, &lt;<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.24">biryani</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.25">raita</span>/<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.26">salan</span>&gt; are common pairs in Indian food.</p>

According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>, there are four basic ingredient categories based on origin - <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.11">plant</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.12">animal</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.13">fungus</span>, and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.14">chemical</span>. Plant-origin ingredients themselves may be used either in primary or processed forms. Further sub-categorization may be based on <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.15">fruits</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.16">herbs</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.17">legumes</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.18">milled cereal products</span>, and so on. There are many more sub-categories highlighting texture, flavor, processing technique, etc. Based on these, we can categorize Indian spice ingredients under different subheadings, based on the descriptions used in the recipes. For example, coriander is used in recipes very frequently either as a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.19">fresh herb</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.20">dried seeds</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.21">powder</span>, or <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.22">paste</span>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p4.1">Different instances of the same recipe may exist with variations in terms of ingredients, instructions, etc. Each of them is considered a unique object of the class recipe. In the Indian context, the same ingredient may be referred to by different regional names. For each such ingredient, a single instance of it is created in the knowledge graph, while storing the different names within it for resolution later. Additionally, since Indian recipes are more compositional in nature in which the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.p4.1.1">texture</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.p4.1.2">flavor</span> of the food item are described more in terms of the end product rather than those of the ingredients alone, we have added texture and flavor as properties of the recipe as well, thus adapting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite> to the Indian context.

A recipe of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p5.1.2">Chicken Chettinad</span> is mentioned to serve 4 people and contains 1 kg of chicken and various other ingredients like 6 pieces of cardamoms, 2 onions, etc. 1 dish of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p5.1.3">Chicken Chettinad</span> serving 1 person may be a scaled version of the recipe which contains ¼ (or 250 gm of) Chicken.

Bowl, glass, cup, and plate are typical measures of Indian dishes belonging to different recipe categories which themselves may result in measurement variations. To avoid the ambiguity associated with these terms, we will store a dictionary of these terms along with their precise definitions such as 1 bowl equals 250 gm. A meal can also constitute a single dish alone. For example, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p5.1.8">Chicken dum biryani</span> is a dish that is also a complete meal by itself, prepared using <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p5.1.9">dum-cook</span>, a typical Indian cooking process, in a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p5.1.10">Handi</span> which is also a typical Indian cooking vessel.</p>

An instance of the foundational ontology for Indian food is created using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in the RDF/XML format by extending reliable and recognized ontologies and dictionaries. Detailed hierarchical designs for storing the labels of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i1.p1.1.2">cuisines</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i1.p1.1.3">diet labels</span>, mealtimes, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i1.p1.1.4">cooking characteristics</span>, etc. described earlier have also been created in the form of a dictionary. Initial vocabulary for each of these structures was populated using various sources like Wikipedia, digitized books <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib25" title="">25</a>]</cite>, FoodKG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>, Indian Food Composition Table <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib23" title="">23</a>]</cite>, and other sources for Indian food <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00830v1#bib.bib22" title="">22</a>]</cite>, though the vocabulary itself is not restricted to Indian food alone. The vocabulary was further augmented using large language models. For example, a list of bulb or stem vegetables commonly found in India was generated using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote5"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">5</span>https://platform.openai.com/docs/models</span></span></span> and added to the list of ingredients. The initialization step is a one-time process that involves careful manual curation with several sanity checks. The vocabulary is also updated periodically as explained later.
We are using the SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) W3C recommendation<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote6"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html</span></span></span> to represent and organize the structured controlled vocabulary as the principal element categories of SKOS such as concepts, labels, notations, documentation, semantic relations, mapping properties, and collections suit the needs of storing food, culinary and nutritional knowledge quite well.</p>

We have identified 40 recipe blogs and websites with rich information about Indian food recipes, their nutritional information, and other culinary information. To begin with, we have crawled 5 recipe blogs viz. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1.2">archanaskitchen</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1.3">hookedonheat</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1.4">indianhealthyrecipes</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1.5">masalakorb</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1.6">vegrecipesofindia</span>, each of which has several recipe websites along with a detailed recipe card for each.

The HTML files are then cleaned and parsed to extract the recipe details such as ingredients, cooking characteristics, nutritional information, etc. from both structured and unstructured parts. This was done by setting up a pipeline using Langchain and GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model, to process the recipe webpage content and generate semi-structured output using zero-shot and few-shot prompts. GPT 3.5 is also employed to translate Indian ingredient names, written in Indian or Roman scripts to their English names. This helps in entity resolution and consolidation later while populating the knowledge graph after the soundness check. This process is executed for all the recipe URLs before moving on to the next steps.</p>

The extracted entities as part of ingredient, cooking processes, cooking utensils etc. are clustered using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for entity resolution to improve the accuracy and precision of entity lists. The consolidated lists are cross-checked against existing known entries. Unknown or new information are verified through human intervention. For example, if an entity <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.I1.i4.I1.i1.p1.1.2">kadahi (wok)</span> is incorrectly identified as a recipe ingredient, instead of a vessel to cook as listed in the vocabulary, then the system flags an inconsistency.

Restriction-based checks are also applied at this stage.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">In this paper, we have presented the work initiated towards building FKG.in. Due to the lack of reference resources, almost everything had to be initiated from scratch. Unlike earlier methods, which have focused on building knowledge graphs from semi-structured data and in application-specific ways, our focus is on using AI-enabled methods for extracting relevant information from all kinds of recipe blogs to populate the knowledge graph. Zero-shot and few-shot methods that exploit the large language model GPT-3.5 Turbo have been used extensively to build initial vocabularies and subsequently to extract entities and relations to populate the knowledge base. Methods to ensure soundness of information are also incorporated into the pipeline. We have presented the current status of the knowledge graph called FKG.in.</p>

Another area of focus is on quantitative assessments of the soundness and completeness of the knowledge graph.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p3.1">In the future, we expect work to spread across many other directions that involve reasoning over Indian food concepts as well. Such knowledge graphs can address several questions of historical, social, and cultural aspects of food and food habits, enable several applications including but not limited to food recommendation systems, personal health navigation systems, recipe generation, and recipe recommendation systems, and also aid knowledge discovery from underlying data. The methods for knowledge curation proposed in this paper are generic and can be replicated for any domain.</p>
