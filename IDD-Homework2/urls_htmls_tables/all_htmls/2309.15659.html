<p id="id3.3" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a prominent distributed learning paradigm facilitating collaboration among nodes within an edge network to co-train a global model without centralizing data. By shifting computation to the network edge, FL offers robust and responsive edge-AI solutions and enhance privacy-preservation. However, deploying deep FL models within edge environments is often hindered by communication bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and memory limitations. To address these challenges jointly, we introduce <span id="id3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>, a pioneering FL framework that effectively employs deep equilibrium learning and consensus optimization to exploit a compact shared data representation across edge nodes, allowing the derivation of personalized models specific to each node. We delve into a unique model structure composed of an equilibrium layer followed by traditional neural network layers. Here, the equilibrium layer functions as a global feature representation that edge nodes can adapt to personalize their local layers. Capitalizing on <span id="id3.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>’s compactness and representation power, we present a novel distributed algorithm rooted in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) consensus optimization and theoretically establish its convergence for smooth objectives. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that <span id="id3.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art personalized methods while employing models of up to 4 times smaller in communication size and 1.5 times lower memory footprint during training.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid proliferation of Internet-connected devices and the consequent vast data they generate, the shortcomings of centralized computing are becoming increasingly evident. Edge networks have emerged as a compelling countermeasure, processing data closer to its source. Such networks capably manage the escalating data volumes, inherently reducing latency, optimizing bandwidth usage and improving real-time responsiveness. In tandem with this shift towards decentralized processing, Federated Learning (FL) has been recognized as an apt machine learning paradigm for the network edge. Contrasting with traditional methods that necessitate transferring all data to a central server, FL enables multiple edge nodes to collaborate on training a unified machine learning model. Here, each node refines the model using its local data and transmits only the model’s updates to a central server, where they are aggregated to improve the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This not only aligns with privacy requirements since data never leaves the network edge, but also provides scalable solutions tapping into the distributed processing power of edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite offering a scalable, privacy-preserving solution that taps into the distributed processing power of edge devices, fully realizing FL’s potential within complex edge environments is contingent upon overcoming three major challenges. First, there are <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication bottlenecks</span>, resulting from the need to transmit large model parameters between parties. These constraints can lead to significant bandwidth limitations, causing inefficiencies and delays in training. Second, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data heterogeneity</span> arises from the variety and diversity of the data held by edge nodes, leading to client drift effects where individual model performances diverge. Finally, <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the limitations in memory and storage</span> constrain the complexity and size of the models that can be deployed, requiring innovative solutions to maximize the potential of FL in edge network scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent literature has presented diverse approaches to address the foregoing challenges, as outlined in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Fig. 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The communication and memory challenges has been tackled using model compression techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to reduce model size for facilitating transmission and adaptive gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> for efficient parameter updates. On the other hand, personalization has emerged as a key strategy to address the issue of data heterogeneity and client drift. Full model personalization methods, such as meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, have shown efficiency in capturing unique local patterns. However, these techniques can be resource-intensive and may necessitate considerable communication overhead. Conversely, partial model personalization approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> offer a balanced solution by employing a shared representation complemented by personalized local models, enabling both customization and conservation of resources. While these methods typically tackle individual challenges, a comprehensive approach that can addressing both communication and memory constraints, as well as data heterogeneity within FL in edge networks remains yet to be thoroughly explored in research.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we address a pivotal question: ”<span id="S1.p4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How do we leverage FL to exploit a compact shared representation under data heterogeneity in edge networks that not only substantially reduces communication bandwidth and memory footprint but effectively enhance learning performance?</span>”. To this end, we propose a novel framework, namely <em id="S1.p4.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FEderated Deep EQuilibrium Learning</em> (<span id="S1.p4.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>), that leverages consensus optimization to learn a shared representation via deep equilibrium models (DEQs), combined with personalized explicit layers for each edge node. The compact shared layer can capture diverse patterns across edge nodes, while the explicit layers are fine-tuned for personalization using local data. This combination enables us to effectively handle the aforementioned challenges: <span id="S1.p4.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> performs on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches while reducing communication by 2–4 times and memory footprint by 1.5 times.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of FL comes in response to three significant challenges in large-scale machine learning, particularly pertinent to edge networks: processing massive amounts of edge data, managing the heavy communication load within networks, and preserving privacy without resorting to centralized storage.

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional FL approaches, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, learn a global model by averaging the model parameters obtained from edge nodes after local SGD rounds. While this method promotes collaboration among nodes, it ignores the intricate of heterogeneous data which leads to suboptimal performance. A prominent way to rectify this drawback is through the implementation of partial personalization, where a model decouples into a <em id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">representation module</em> and a <em id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized module</em>. The former serves as a collaborative learning ground for edge nodes to acquire a common representation (either linear or non-linear) that captures the shared patterns and regularities across all nodes’ data. This common learning phase helps maintain a unified and consistent model view. On the other hand, the <em id="S3.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized module</em> adapts and refines itself to the unique characteristics of each node’s local data, thereby enabling better local generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

In this work, we employ a variant of AA to expedite the convergence of fixed-point iterations.
The concept behind AA is to form the next iterate as a linear combination of past iterates, rather than merely relying on the last iterate. Specifically, AA minimizes the differences between the iterates and their mapped values over a history of <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.m1.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math> previous iterations. 
In terms of representation learning in <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.8.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>, we suggest a warm-start strategy for AA in which the fixed point of the previous iterations is reused as the initial point for the next.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p13.1" class="ltx_p">One of the significant advantages of DEQs’ backward pass is their memory efficiency. In traditional deep learning models, the activations of all layers need to be stored for backpropagation. In contrast, DEQs only need to store the final equilibrium state, as all layers are the same and share the same parameters. This results in substantial memory savings, especially for very deep networks. Furthermore, DEQs allow for end-to-end training with gradient-based optimization methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Despite the complexity introduced by the fixed-point iteration and implicit differentiation, the backward pass is still differentiable, and gradients can be computed and used for parameter updates.</p>

Surprisingly, recent research has demonstrated implicit differentiation can be performed by using the zeroth-order approximation of the Neumann series for the inverse of the Jacobian matrix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> instead of explicitly computing of this expensive term. This approach still provides satisfactory performance with significantly reducing computation time.
Hence, in this work, we employ this Jacobian-Free backpropagation approach to estimate the implicit gradients.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL for edge networks, the data heterogeneity across diverse edge nodes often culminates in a pronounced challenge known as <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client drift</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Such drift emerges when edge nodes, optimizing their model based on uniquely distributed data, converge toward a local objective minimum. This local convergence may differ considerably from the global optimization objective desired for an aggregated model. Consequently, when the server integrates models from myriad nodes, it often encounters a compounded effect of these varied local minima. The resulting global model, unfortunately, can become an aggregate that fails to optimally represent any individual edge node’s data, leading to overall suboptimal performance.</p>

Equilibrium models, with their implicitly ”infinite-depth” single layer, simplify model complexity and reduce communication overhead by requiring fewer parameters. Moreover, they maintain a constant, often lower, memory footprint than traditional deep models, thus enabling resource-constrained edge devices to manage complex models without straining hardware resources. Additionally, the ADMM framework permits asynchronous updates of local parameters, thereby optimizing network resource utilization and convergence speed.</p>

Especially, ResNet-20 and ResNet-34 are then employed for experiments on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, correspondingly. For sequence tasks, we design a DEQ-Transformer based on Universal Transformer (UT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, consisting of an equilibrium UT block succeeded by a personalized module with one last UT block and one linear layer; while other methods use a UT with 8 layers, 4-head attention (Transformer-8). Specific details regarding the shared parameters and personalized parameters, including the number of model parameters and the model sizes, are presented in <a href="#S5.T2" title="In V-A Experimental Setup ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> and <a href="#A2.SS1" title="B-A Model and Training Details ‣ Appendix B Experimental Details ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Sec.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">B-A</span></span></a>.</p>

As anticipated, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> consistently outperforms non-personalized methods (Local, FedAvg, and FedAvg+FT), which generally exhibit lower performance compared to personalized approaches in the context of data heterogeneity. Taking the FEMNIST dataset as an example, while the best non-personalized algorithm, FedAvg+FT, achieves accuracies of 84.98% for 100 nodes and 85.40% for 200 nodes, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> impressively scores 87.13% and 87.46% respectively, demonstrating a clear advantage in the realm of approximately 18%.</p>

On FEMNIST dataset, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> achieves accuracies faintly less than Ditto but outshines the other methods.
In the CIFAR-10 dataset with various degrees of heterogeneity, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> achieves top accuracies of 90.54% and 82.84% respectively. These results marginally surpass the performance of other personalized algorithms like Ditto, which scores 90.27% and 82.18% under the same conditions. Similarly, for the CIFAR-100 dataset, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>’s performance peaks at 80.42% and 57.49% for configurations (100, 5) and (100, 20), respectively, again nudging past the closest competitor, Ditto, which posts figures of 80.37% and 57.18%.
Furthermore, in the next-character prediction task, while kNN-Per achieves the highest accuracy, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.5" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> closely follows with a small gap, exhibiting competitiveness. Consequently, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.6" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> consistently delivers comparable or superior performance with SOTA algorithms across all datasets, while offering substantial efficiency in terms of communication with up to <math id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="4" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml">4</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1.1">4</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.7.m7.1c">4</annotation></semantics></math> times smaller in the size of representation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We demonstrate the benefits of the shared representation in generalizing to new, unseen edge nodes. To achieve this, we split the edge nodes into two groups: 90% training nodes, and 10% new, unseen nodes. Initially, we train the shared representation for <span id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>, FedPer FedRep, and kNN-Per using the designated training group, then use it to refine the personalization layers for new nodes using their training data, which has not been incorporated during the representation training process. For FedAvg and Ditto, a full model will be trained and adapted to new participants.

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Our investigation turns towards assessing the robustness and adaptability of the shared representation learned by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>, FedPer, and FedRep, particularly on the FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. For a comprehensive assessment, two tailored scenarios have been meticulously designed. In the first scenario, we vary the local epochs for updating personalized parameters while keeping a constant number of epochs for training the shared representation. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9.sf1" title="Fig. 9(a) ‣ Fig. 9 ‣ V-B4 Performance of Personalized Models. ‣ V-B Results and Evaluation ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a>,<a href="#S5.F9.sf3" title="Fig. 9(c) ‣ Fig. 9 ‣ V-B4 Performance of Personalized Models. ‣ V-B Results and Evaluation ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(c)</span></a>, in FEMNIST, all methods only require a few personalized epochs to reach peak performance due to the simplicity of the dataset; however, overfitting becomes a concern shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, in CIFAR-10, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> achieves desirable results with fewer personalized updates than the others.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p2.3" class="ltx_p">In the second scenario, the emphasis is shifted towards the epochs for training the shared representation while the epochs for personalized parameter updates are kept constant. We observe that a satisfactory shared representation could be achieved within a few epochs across all methods on both datasets, but <span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> potentially needs fewer to attain a good one, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9.sf2" title="Fig. 9(b) ‣ Fig. 9 ‣ V-B4 Performance of Personalized Models. ‣ V-B Results and Evaluation ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a>,<a href="#S5.F9.sf4" title="Fig. 9(d) ‣ Fig. 9 ‣ V-B4 Performance of Personalized Models. ‣ V-B Results and Evaluation ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Federated Deep Equilibrium Learning: A Compact Shared Representation for Edge Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(d)</span></a>. These results imply that <span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span> can learn representations more effectively than its explicit counterparts. Furthermore, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>’s performance consistently surpasses the others in both scenarios, highlighting its ability to maintain stable performance on personalization.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As FL to be deployed the network edge, efficient memory management has become a non-negotiable criterion, especially in scenarios with resource constraints.

<p id="S6.p1.4" class="ltx_p">The challenges of data heterogeneity, communication bottlenecks, and memory constraints are well-known in FL at the network edge. While existing works have extensively addressed each problem—such as using model personalization for data heterogeneity or model compression to reduce communication cost—a comprehensive solution to address these challenges is underexplored. In this paper, we introduce <span id="S6.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_sansserif">FeDEQ</span>, a novel approach for FL that aims to tackle these challenges concurrently.
