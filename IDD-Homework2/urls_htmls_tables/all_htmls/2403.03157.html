<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">This study explores the benefits of integrating the novel clustered federated learning (CFL) approach with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels.
A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users’ data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As stated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, there will be more than 29 billion networked devices by 2023. In light of the rapid growth of mobile applications and networked devices, traditional machine learning frameworks face new challenges in supporting the vast amount of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In this context, federated learning (FL) attracts the great attention of researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FL offers better privacy and efficiency than traditional learning schemes by periodically sharing the local model updates with the server. It is widely acknowledged that the increased size of data in the training process can enhance the performance of the model. However, the constraints imposed by wireless networks, i.e., a limited number of sub-channels and stringent energy consumption requirements, can adversely impact the performance of FL due to reduced user participation. Moreover, this problem becomes even more severe when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is gaining attraction as a viable solution for its ability to boost spectrum efficiency and support massive connectivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Due to the above characteristics, employing NOMA to improve the performance of FL is well-motivated. Specifically, greater cooperation and engagement across the spectrum can be achieved by involving more devices in the training process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop advanced FL frameworks and design wireless networks accordingly.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since Google’s pioneering study on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, there has been a surge of research interest in FL and its design in wireless networks. In the literature, the studies have been investigated from the following two perspectives. Firstly, the state-of-the-art FL and Clustered FL (CFL) frameworks are investigated. Then, the recent research related to wireless communication design for FL is reviewed.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world scenarios, i.e., cross-device or cross-silo, the data distribution tends to be non-IID across the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Training on such distribution can lead to weight divergence and client drift, which consequently hinder the model generalization as noted in several works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To mitigate the adverse effects caused by the non-IID dataset, extensive studies have been investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors present a CFL framework to address the issue of the divergence in the data distributions of local devices, where the clustering is based on the cosine similarity between the weight updates of different devices. The framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> assigns devices to the cluster model that yields the lowest loss on the device’s local data, while FL+HC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> utilizes hierarchical clustering (HC) by treating devices’ gradients as features on various distance metrics. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors apply K-means to devices’ model weights to address the problem caused by non-IID datasets. The ultimate goal of these methods is to group devices’ model parameters or gradients, either through a one-shot or iterative approach.</p>

The study proposes an AoI-based device selection scheme to address weight divergence and convergence issues in non-IID datasets. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the authors propose techniques to implement distributed stochastic gradient descent over a shared noisy wireless channel. Chen et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> tackle the issue of training FL algorithms over wireless networks, taking into account wireless constraints such as packet errors and resource availability, where the Hungarian algorithm is used to select devices based on data size. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors
investigate the concept of the AoI into FL over wireless networks, aiming to optimize various aspects for achieving better performance, i.e., device selection and resource allocation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a min-max optimization problem is formulated into a primal-dual setup. The modified Truncated Monte Carlo method is employed for estimating device contributions, leading to improvements in model generalization, convergence, and device-level performance in FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a study of maximizing model accuracy within a given total training time budget in latency-constrained FL in wireless networks is investigated. A lower bound on the training loss is derived to guide the design of the solutions. The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> addresses the challenges of deploying FL in wireless networks by proposing the Adaptive Quantization Based on Ensemble Distillation (AQeD) scheme, which efficiently manages the complexities arising from model heterogeneity and communication costs.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the numerous and critical directions of FL in wireless networks that have been investigated in the existing papers, the study of NOMA-enhanced FL design still remains a notable gap. Specifically, there is a lack of joint optimization of the NOMA transmission in relation to sub-channel assignment and power allocation, along with the training accuracy of the FL, especially when dealing with non-IID data distribution.
Moreover, advanced and efficient FL frameworks are not adequately explored in the context of FL in wireless networks, as training on non-IID data can further negatively impact FL performance.
Since the data is stored locally, it is impractical to transfer all the data to the server for clustering due to high communication costs and privacy constraints. Most existing CFL frameworks demand high computational resources or extensive data transmission to the server, which may not be practical given the computational and transmission overhead in wireless networks. For example, the similarities between each user’s gradient are required to be computed each round, or all users need to be engaged in the first round for the clustering purpose.
To address these challenges, there is a pressing need to develop a mathematically tractable FL in wireless networks framework tailored for non-IID data distributions. In this light, a novel NOMA-assisted CFL framework is proposed. The contributions are elaborated as follows:

This makes it essential to use clustering algorithms to group users into separate clusters, which in turn helps to reduce the generalization gap.
In order to preserve data privacy in FL and save computational and transmission costs, the proposed framework aims to identify the cluster structure that best represents the entirety of the dataset, relying solely on the underlying distribution of each user.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.19" class="ltx_p">Inspired by image segmentation, a clustering method based on spectral clustering with the relaxed RatioCut is proposed.
Spectral clustering is a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm and is extensively employed across various applications as it allows flexibility on the input data compared to traditional clustering algorithms, i.e., K-means<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. In this subsection, a brief description of the proposed spectral clustering is provided. For a more in-depth understanding of spectral clustering, the concept can refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The model used to train MNIST is the neural network that begins by reshaping the input data from a 28x28 matrix to a flattened vector of 784 elements. This is followed by a fully connected layer, and then a dropout layer is employed for regularization with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. Subsequently, another fully connected layer is applied before Softmax activation for the final classification output.
For the model trained in the CIFAR-10 dataset, the architecture is similar to LeNet-5, which begins with a convolutional layer followed by ReLU activation function and a 2x2 max pooling. Subsequently, another convolution with 6 to 16 channels, is paired with ReLU and max pooling. After flattening, the data traverses through three fully connected layers, reducing dimensions progressively from the feature map size to 120, then 84, and finally 10. The output is processed via a Softmax activation for classification. The optimizer of training both datasets is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for aligning the analysis in Section <a href="#S2" title="II System Model ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, while 0.9 momentum is utilized to train the CIFAR-10 dataset for accelerating the convergence.
The model architectures used in the simulations are not state-of-the-art but are adequate for demonstrating the relative performance of the proposed methods in the paper.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the performance comparisons between the proposed FL algorithm using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under the extreme non-IID case similar in Fig. <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:Fig:alpha_001</span>. These comparisons are under different transmission strategies, including the random sub-channel allocation with fixed power allocation (R-F), matching-based sub-channel with fixed power allocation (MBA-F), and matching-based sub-channel with optimized power allocation (MBA-KKT), incorporating both in OMA and NOMA schemes. While the improvement in test accuracy for the MNIST dataset is moderate, it is evident that the proposed schemes, specifically MBA-KKT, can outperform on both datasets in terms of test accuracy and convergence rate. The improvement in performance is more notable in the CIFAR-10 dataset, indicating that the more challenging tasks benefit more from the proposed approaches. This improvement is attributed to the increased user participation during training, by optimizing through the proposed sub-channel and power allocations.
To ensure equitable comparisons, simulations carried out on the OMA scheme involve the same number of users as those in the NOMA scheme. For better visualization, the moving average technique is applied to the test accuracy data for the CIFAR-10 dataset. This process takes a set of data points and replaces each point with the average of the surrounding points.</p>

<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From comprehensive grid searches, it is notable to observe the effect of varying learning rates under the FL in wireless network settings. One of the observations is that the more users engage in training through optimal sub-channel and power allocation, the lesser the impact learning rate and batch size possess. It means that the optimization schemes could benefit the generalization performance and convergence rate, but also in fine-tuning processes.
Additionally, it is not advisable to maintain a constant learning rate when an increasing number of users are contributing to the training. Intriguingly, as the number of users increases, the test accuracy also improves when the learning rate is raised, but only up to a certain point due to a larger batch size with a higher learning rate might lead to unstable training, potentially resulting the problems, i.e., overfitting or poor generalization. This observation contradicts the intuition that the learning rate should decrease as the batch size grows.
This insight suggests that the learning rate could be proportionally increased with the batch size up to a certain limit. Exploring this relationship further could provide valuable guidance for the future design of advanced FL frameworks and optimization schemes, which may be included in future works.</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The proposed framework can outperform both conventional FL and random selection approaches. In the latter approach, users are randomly assigned to clusters while keeping the same number of clusters as simulated in the proposed setup. It can be observed that neglecting the underlying distributions across the devices when employing random allocation can adversely affect performance. For example, accuracy drops from 87.75% to 83.11% in MNIST and from 41.76% to 39.37% in CIFAR-10. Moreover, the stability of training is affected compared to the conventional and the proposed framework. This instability can be attributed to the reduced number of users engaged in the specific group, negatively impacting both performance and stability, as previously demonstrated in Section <a href="#S2" title="II System Model ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. Conversely, by carefully considering the underlying distributions, not only the generalization performance can be improved, but also the convergence rate could be beneficial as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

Both the selected number of clusters on the proposed method perform the best, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method demonstrated in <a href="#S4.SS2.SSS2" title="IV-B2 Selecting Number of Clusters ‣ IV-B Spectral Clustering ‣ IV Description of Methodologies in CFL Framework ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span>2</span></a>.
Additionally, both sub-figures illustrate that performance drops when an excessive number of clusters are chosen during training. Specifically, performance suffers when the number of clusters exceeds the optimal threshold. This further emphasizes the point discussed in subsection <a href="#S4.SS2.SSS2" title="IV-B2 Selecting Number of Clusters ‣ IV-B Spectral Clustering ‣ IV Description of Methodologies in CFL Framework ‣ Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span>2</span></a>, the number of clusters should not be brutally increased with the rise in the degree of heterogeneity.</p>

Regarding computational efficiency, the proposed sub-channel allocation method is around 335 times faster than the exhaustive search-based strategy, as determined over 2000 simulations, averaging the execution times.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has considered the integration of NOMA into the novel CFL framework by enabling the groups of devices to learn more specialized models through the clustering process, taking into account the time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels. Specifically, the server will learn the underlying distribution of the users, and gather the users with similar data distributions. The considered sub-channel and power allocation problem have been jointly optimized, and simulation results have been presented to demonstrate that the proposed FL framework can achieve drastic improvements over the FL baselines. Notably, integrating NOMA can further boost the performance of FL in terms of classification accuracy, by encouraging more users to participate during the training. A promising future direction is to explore the potential of active learning in the FL for labeling the data under the NOMA scheme. Furthermore, investigations of how NOMA can augment system throughput for real-time model transmission present an exciting direction for future research.</p>
