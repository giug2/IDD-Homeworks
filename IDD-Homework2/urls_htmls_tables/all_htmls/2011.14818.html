<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In the distributed collaborative machine learning (DCML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) recently attracted much attention due to its applications in health, finance, and the latest innovations such as industry 4.0 and smart vehicles.
FL provides privacy-by-design. It trains a machine learning model collaboratively over several distributed clients (ranging from two to millions) such as mobile phones, without sharing their raw data with any other participant.
In practical scenarios, all clients do not have sufficient computing resources (e.g., Internet of Things), the machine learning model has millions of parameters, and its privacy between the server and the clients while training/testing is a prime concern (e.g., rival parties). In this regard, FL is not sufficient, so split learning (SL) is introduced. SL is reliable in these scenarios as it splits a model into multiple portions, distributes them among clients and server, and trains/tests their respective model portions to accomplish the full model training/testing. In SL, the participants do not share both data and their model portions to any other parties, and usually, a smaller network portion is assigned to the clients where data resides.
Recently, a hybrid of FL and SL, called splitfed learning, is introduced to elevate the benefits of both FL (faster training/testing time) and SL (model split and training).
Following the developments from FL to SL, and considering the importance of SL, this chapter is designed to provide extensive coverage in SL and its variants. The coverage includes fundamentals, existing findings, integration with privacy measures such as differential privacy, open problems, and code implementation.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In today’s world, machine learning (ML) has become an integral part in various domains, including health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. As data are usually distributed and stored among different locations (e.g., data centers and hospitals), distributed collaborative machine learning (DCML) is used over conventional (centralized) machine learning to access them without centrally pooling all data. Moreover, additional advantages of DCML over conventional machine learning includes improved privacy of data by limiting it within its primary locations and distributed computations. Overall, DCML has become an essential tool for training/testing ML/AI models in a wide scale of distributed environments ranging from few to millions of devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DCML introduces collaborative architectures that enable reliable solutions for data sharing and model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) is a DCML mechanism that provides a widely accepted approach for ML/AI. In FL, several distributed clients (e.g., mobile phones) train a global ML/AI model collaboratively in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner by keeping data within the local boundaries (i.e., data custodians/clients) while sharing no data among participating entities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in FL, each client keeps a copy of the entire model and trains it with the local data, and in a subsequent step, the local models (trained locally) are forwarded to a coordinating server for the aggregation, which produces a global model. However, in a resource-constrained environment (e.g., the internet of things environments) where the clients have limited computing capability, FL is not feasible. As the server is assumed to have high computing resources than clients, FL is not leveraging that as the sever performs low computing jobs such as model aggregation and coordination. In contrast, the server can compute a larger portion of the ML model and reduce the computation at the client-side. As such, split learning (SL) is introduced.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">SL is a DCML approach that introduces a split in executing a model training/testing that is shared among clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. The server and clients have access only to their portion of the whole model. Thus, it provides model privacy while training/testing in contrast to FL; in addition to keeping input data in the local bounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. Besides, SL can be communication efficient and achieve faster convergence than FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. Due to these inherent features of SL, it is gaining much research attention. There have been various research works performed to address its multiple aspects, including performance enhancement by introducing a variant of SL, called splitfed learning (SFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, leakage reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, and communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. However, there are many open problems, including efficient leakage reductions, handling non-IID data distributions among clients, and reducing communication costs. An extensive understanding of SL is required to address these problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This chapter provides comprehensive knowledge on SL and its variants, recent advancements, and integration with privacy measures such as differential privacy and leakage reduction techniques. In this regard, this chapter is divided into four main sections: (S1) federated learning to split learning, (S2) data privacy and privacy-enhancing techniques, (S3) applications and implementation, and (S4) challenge and open problems.
Firstly, Section S1 presents the fundamentals, dynamics, crucial results produced under FL, and detailed coverage on SL and SFL. The primary focus is given to SL. Detailed coverage is done on the key results that include performance analysis, effects of the number of clients on the performance, communication efficiency, data privacy leakage, and methods to perform SL over partitioned datasets (e.g., vertical partitioned) among clients.
Secondly, Section S2 explores the dynamics of privacy offered by FL, SL, and SFL in their default settings. Afterward, this chapter discusses privacy measures such as encryption-based techniques and provides details on the provable-privacy mechanism, called differential privacy, which are employed further to enhance the data privacy with these DCML techniques.
Thirdly, Section S3 presents the significance of SL and SFL by highlighting their applications in various domains, including health. Besides, it provides technical background on implementing the related concepts highlighting programmatic techniques with code examples.
Finally, open challenges and potential future research directions are discussed in Section S4.

Hence, the discussions on FL act as a base to the rest of the chapter. Consequently, the discussions on FL is followed by an in-depth analysis of SL and its variants by covering their existing results and recent developments.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the promising aspects of the underlying architecture, FL is gaining much attention in privacy-preserving data analytics. Google and Apple are two major companies that utilize FL capabilities in training ML/AI models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Besides, it is gaining attention in transportation (e.g., self-driving cars) and Industry 4.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Several implementation-based frameworks are already supporting FL. Some of these frameworks include PySyft <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, Leaf <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and PaddleFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on different requirements, such as the feature space distribution, different FL configurations can be employed. These configurations include (1) horizontal federated learning, (2) vertical federated learning, and (3) federated transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. Horizontal federated learning is used when all distributed clients share the same feature space but different data samples. Vertical federated learning is used when the distributed clients have different feature spaces that belong to the same data samples, and federated transfer learning is used when the distributed clients have different datasets that have different feature spaces belong to different data samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. However, one of the fundamental issues in FL is the communication bottleneck. When clients need to connect through the Internet, communications become potentially expensive and oftentimes unreliable. Besides, the limited computational capabilities of distributed clients often make the whole process slower in model training. FL requires a particular client to hold the entire model. Hence, in a situation where a heavy deep learning model needs to be trained, an FL client should have enough computing power, which avoids resource-constrained devices being employed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Besides, the requirement of continuous communications with the server also limits FL’s use in a conventional environment that does not possess powerful communication channels. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, distributed nodes/clients can face different failures, directly affecting the global model generalization. Hence, the participation of an extensively large number of clients can make FL unreliable. Different compression mechanisms such as gradient compression, model broadcast compression, and local computation reduction are being experimented to maintain an acceptable FL efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It has also been shown that unbalanced and non-IID data partitioning across unreliable devices drastically affects model convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Data leakage introduces another layer of complexity for FL in addition to such data communication and data convergence issues. It has been shown that the parameters transferred between the clients and the server can leak information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The participation of malicious clients or servers can introduce many security and privacy vulnerabilities—the backdoor attacks is an example where malicious entities can deploy backdoor to learn others’ data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Besides, privacy attacks, such as membership inference, can exploit this vulnerability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Many existing works try to employ third-party solutions such as fully homomorphic encryption and differential privacy to limit such unanticipated privacy leaks from FL. However, the performance of these approaches is always governed by the limitations of these approaches (e.g., high computational complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>). In a distributed setup where resource-constrained devices are used, this can be a challenging task.</p>

In SL, the client commits only to the training/testing of the client-side network, and the server executes only to the training/testing of the server-side network. The training and testing of the full model are done by executing a sequential (forward/backward) propagation between a client and the server. In the simplest form, firstly, the forward propagation takes place as follows: a client forward propagates until a specific layer of the network, which is called the <em id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cut layer</em>, over the raw data, then the cut layer’s activations, called <em id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">smashed data</em>, are transmitted to the server. Smashed data matrix is represented as <math id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{A}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">𝐀</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝐀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.6.m6.1c">\mathbf{A}</annotation></semantics></math>. Afterward, the server considers the smashed data (received from the client) as its input and performs the forward propagation on the remaining layers. So far, a single forward propagation on the full model is completed.
Now the back-propagation takes place as follows: After calculating the loss, the server starts back-propagation, where it computes gradients of weights and activations of the layers until the cut layer, and then transmits the smashed data’s gradients back to the client. With the received gradients, the client executes its back-propagation on its client-side network. So far, a single pass of the back-propagation between a client and the server is completed.
In ML/AI model training, the (forward and back) propagation continue until the model is trained on all the participating clients and meet a decent convergence point (e.g., high prediction accuracy).

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By limiting the client-side model network portion up to a few number of layers, SL reduces the client-side computation compared to FL, where each client has to train a full-sized model.
Besides, while machine learning training/testing, the server and clients are limited within their designated portions of the full model, and the full model is not accessible to them. To predict the missing model portion, a semi-honest<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>A semi-honest entity in collaboration among multiple entities performs their jobs as specified, but it can be curious about the details of the information present in other participating entities. It is also called an honest-but-curious entity.</span></span></span> client or server requires to predict entire parameters of the missing model portion, and its probability decrease with the increase in model parameters in the portion. As a result, SL provides a certain level of privacy to the trained model from honest but curious clients and the server. There is no model privacy between the clients and server in FL as both of them have either white-box access (i.e., full access) to the full model, or the server can easily predict the full model from the gradients of the locally trained model that are transferred by clients for model aggregation.</p>

In centralized distributed training, after a client completes its training with the main server, it uploads an encrypted version of the weights of the client-side network either to the server or a third-party server.

In peer-to-peer distributed training, the server sends the address of the last trained client to the new client, which then downloads the encrypted weights directly from the client and loads them to its client-side network after decryption.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Vanilla split learning is the most straightforward configuration, in which the client shares the smashed data and labels with the server (Fig. <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Different configurations in split learning: ‣ 2.2.1 Split learning ‣ 2.2 Split learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

In an extended vanilla split learning, some other workers process some intermediate layers of the ML network before passing it to the main server (Fig. <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Different configurations in split learning: ‣ 2.2.1 Split learning ‣ 2.2 Split learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

An analogous extension of the vanilla configuration provides the ‘Tor’ like multi-hop split learning configuration, where one client has data, and multiple clients/servers train a portion of the ML network in a sequence.
In SL without label sharing configuration, the client only shares the smashed data to the server (unlike vanilla split learning), which completes forward propagation up to some layers of the network, called <em id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">server cut layer</em>, and then again sends the activations of its server cut layer to the client, which then completes the forward propagation up to the output layer. Afterward, the client starts backpropagation and sends the gradients of the activations of the server cut layer to the server. Then the server carries out the backpropagation and sends the smashed data’s gradients to the client, which then completes its backpropagations. Here the forward propagation and backpropagation happen in a U-shape (client <math id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Longleftrightarrow" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">⟺</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1">⟺</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.1.m1.1c">\Longleftrightarrow</annotation></semantics></math> server <math id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Longleftrightarrow" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">⟺</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1.1">⟺</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.SSS1.Px2.p2.2.m2.1c">\Longleftrightarrow</annotation></semantics></math> client), thus it is also called U-shaped configuration (Fig. <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Different configurations in split learning: ‣ 2.2.1 Split learning ‣ 2.2 Split learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

For SL with vertically partitioned data configuration (Fig. <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Different configurations in split learning: ‣ 2.2.1 Split learning ‣ 2.2 Split learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

Advancements of federated learning towards privacy preservation: from federated learning to split learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(d)), clients have a vertically partitioned dataset configuration, and each carries out the forward propagation on its local client-side ML network portions. Then they transfer their smashed data to the server. Afterward, the server concatenates all smashed data and carry on the forward propagation on the single server-side model. The backpropagation proceeds from the output layer up to the concatenation layer at the server, which then transmits the respective smashed data’s gradients to the clients. Next, the clients perform their backpropagation on their client-side ML network portions.
In SL for multi-task output, multi-modal data from different clients train their client-side ML network up to their corresponding cut layer and then transfer their smashed data to an intermediate agent, which concatenates the smashed data from all clients. Afterward, it sends the concatenated smashed data to multiple servers, where each server trains its server-side model.</p>

For example, if labels are sensitive to the clients, then there is no need to send it to the server; instead, U-shape SL can be used as the learning configuration. If there is a need to keep the identity of clients confidential to the server, then it can be done by the extended vanilla configuration or tor configuration.</p>

The data distribution is of two types: independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID. In IID distribution, the training datasets distributed among the clients are IID sampled from the total dataset, where each sample has the same probability distribution and mutually independent of each other. The non-IID dataset distribution in a distributed setup with multiple clients refers to the difference in the distribution and any dependencies of the local datasets among the clients. The non-IID dataset due to the quantity skew (i.e., different number of samples in different clients), and label distribution skew (i.e., different clients can have samples belonging to the particular labels) are explored in SL.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For imbalanced data distributions (different sample sizes in different clients ranging from 48 to 3855), the convergence of FL is slow if there is an increase in the number of clients (50 and 100). In contrast, for the same setup, SL’s fast convergence shows less sensitivity in convergence towards imbalanced data distributions. However, the model performance (e.g., accuracy) decreases if there is an increase in the number of clients for the case with imbalance data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
SL is highly sensitive to non-IID data distributions than FL.

In a separate work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, for ResNet18 on the HAM10000 dataset, SL is shown to have an efficient communication when the number of clients is twenty, whereas, for AlexNet on MNIST, it is efficient after five clients. These studies reconfirm the following result: In terms of communication efficiency, if the model size and the number of clients are large, then SL is efficient than FL; otherwise (for a small model and few clients), FL is efficient.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This category explores and addresses the research questions related to carrying SL under various partitions of the datasets among the clients. Most of the works in SL consider the horizontal partition of the dataset, where different clients have different samples but all with the same feature space. However, in fields like finance, multiple clients (finance institutes) can have the same sample (related to the same set of data owners) but with different features. The dataset, in this case, is referred to as a vertically partitioned dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SL with vertical partitioning of datasets is performed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. This work evaluates several aggregating configurations to merge the outputs of the partial networks from multiple clients and analyze the performance and resource efficiency. The configurations include element-wise average, element-wise maximum, element-wise sum, element-wise multiplication, and concatenation. Considering three financial datasets, namely Bank Marketing, Some Credit Kaggle, and Financial PhraseBank, the experiments show that the performance depends on the dataset and the merging technique. Element-wise average pooling outperforms other techniques for Financial PhraseBank, whereas element-wise max pooling and concatenation for Bank Marketing and Give me Credit, respectively, outperforms other approaches. In other experiments, the performance degradation with the increase in the number of clients dropping during the training and testing is observed.
Moreover, the communication and computation costs are measured for this setup, and their dependencies on the dataset and model architecture are observed. A similar technique of concatenating the smashed data from the clients before feeding to the server-side model is used in multiple classifications with horizontal partitioning of the dataset in SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. This is done primarily for privacy reasons, as this setup does not require the client-side models to synchronize. However, a trusted worker to concatenate the smashed data is added to the setup.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This category explores and addresses the research questions related to privacy and information leakage and their countermeasures. Information leakage from an ML model is defined as the ability to reconstruct the original raw data from model parameters or intermediate activations. In SL, possible information leakage is an investigation based on the data communicated between the clients and the server. The server receives the smashed data from the clients in each epoch, and the smashed data can leak information about private/sensitive raw data as it possesses a certain level of correlation to the raw data.</p>

The combined optimization of the resulting loss term reduces the leakage from the smashed data without degrading accuracy. Furthermore, the same approach of distance correlation is used for attribute privacy, where the distance correlation is minimized between the smashed data and the certain attribute (e.g., age, race, and gender) of the raw data.

This results in a higher latency in the model training/testing in SL. Consequently, the latency adds challenges in SL to leverage the advantages of SL in a resource-constrained environment where fast model training/testing time is required to periodically update the model with the continually updating dataset with time. This environment characterizes the fields such as health and finance, where in a distributed setting, frequent model updates are required to incorporate newly available threats in activities, including real-time anomaly detection and fraud detection. In this regard, to utilize the benefits of both FL and SL, splitfed learning is introduced.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SFL is a hybrid form of FL and SL. It performs client-side model training/testing in parallel, such as in FL, and trains/tests the full model by splitting it to the client-side and server-side for privacy and computation benefits such as in SL. Its architecture is divided into two main parts; the client-side part and the main-server part. In the client-side part, unlike SL, SFL introduces an extra worker, called the fed server, that is dedicated to performing the synchronization of the client-side model (see Fig. <a href="#S2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 2.3.1 Splitfed learning ‣ 2.3 Splitfed learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the fed-server sends the global initial client-side model to all clients. Then, all clients (e.g., different hospitals or IoMTs with limited computing power) proceed with their forward propagation on their local data over the client-side model in parallel. Secondly, the smashed data are transmitted to the main server, which usually has enough computing power (e.g., cloud computing platform or research institution with a high-performance computing platform). Once the main server receives the smashed data from clients, it starts the forward propagation over the server-side model. The computations (forward and backpropagation) at the server-side associated with each client’s smashed data can be done per client basis in parallel due to its high computing resource and independence of the operations related to clients.
The main server computes the gradients of the smashed data with respect to the loss function in its backpropagation and sends the gradients to the respective client. Thirdly, each client completes its backpropagation on their client-side models. The forward propagation and backpropagation between the clients and the server proceed for some rounds without the fed server. Afterward, the clients transmit the client-side networks’ updates in the form of gradients to the fed server. Then, the fed server aggregates the updates and makes a global client-side model, which is sent back to all clients. This way, the client-side model synchronization happens in splitfed learning. Averaging is a simple method widely used for model aggregation in fed server; thus, the computation in it is not costly, making it suitable to operate within the local edge boundaries. There are two ways to do the server-side model synchronization: firstly, train the server-side model separately over the smashed data from each client, and later aggregate (e.g., a weighted average) all resulting server-side models to make the global server-side model – this is known as splitfedv1 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>– and secondly, keep training the same server-side model over the smashed data from different clients – this is known as splitfedv2 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are three aspects that have been investigated in SFL: performance, training time latency, and privacy. Splitfed shows the same communication efficiency as of SL, with significantly less training time than SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.

Moreover, even for multiple clients ranging from 1 to 100 with ResNet18 over the HAM10000 dataset, the performance pattern is close to each other. However, this result is not present in general, specifically, for a higher number of clients. LeNet5 on FMNIST with 100 users has slow convergence in splitfedv1 than others, and AlexNet on HAM10000 with 100 users has failed to converge in splitfedv2. For uniformly distributed HAM10000 and MNIST datasets with multiple clients over the ResNet18 and AlexNet, SFL is shown to reducing the training time by four to six times than SL. The same communication cost for both SL and SFL is observed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL, SL, and SFL provide certain privacy to the raw data, called default privacy, in their vanilla setting as the raw data are always within the control of data custodians, and no raw data sharing among the participants. This setup works perfectly well in an environment where the participating entities are semi-honest adversaries<span id="footnote7" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">7</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">7</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">7</span>A semi-honest adversary in a collaborative environment with multiple entities executes their assigned task as expected, but it can be curious about the information of the other entities.</span></span></span>.
However, if the capability of adversaries is increased more than their curious state, for example, membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> and model memorization attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, then the default privacy is not sufficient, and other approaches are needed in addition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In literature, commonly used approaches are secure multiparty computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, and differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Secure multiparty computation
provides a privacy preservation model based on the zero-knowledge concept where multiple parties jointly compute a function on their inputs without letting their inputs to any other party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>.
However, it is recommended under lower security requirements with a certain level of efficiency degradation, especially in communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Homomorphic encryption performs the computations of arbitrary functions on encrypted data without decryption. Thus an untrusted third-party entity can be involved in the computations while maintaining the privacy of input data/model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. However, due to the extensive computations and overhead, homomorphic encryption introduces a severe degradation of efficiency. Differential privacy involves the addition of calibrated noise to data or models so that the adversaries cannot extract private information while the expected utility of the data is maintained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Due to the noise addition, differential privacy introduces a certain
level of utility loss.</p>

Furthermore, its properties such as immunity to post-processing, privacy guarantee, and composite differential privacy further signify its importance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the strong privacy guarantee, DP has been applied with deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> applications in DCML for areas such as healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Moreover, with DP, deep learning can guarantee a robust resistance to privacy attacks such as membership inference attacks and model memorization attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
The differentially private solutions for deep learning can be categorized into two types: (1) approaches based on global differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and (2) approaches based on local differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, the existing architectural configurations of differentially private deep learning is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 3.1 Differential privacy and its application ‣ 3 Data privacy and privacy-enhancing techniques ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

Advancements of federated learning towards privacy preservation: from federated learning to split learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Global differential privacy applies noise based on the training algorithm. For example, it adds calibrated noise over the gradients of the model at each step of the stochastic gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In contrast, local differential privacy applies noise to the data transferred between entities. For example, the noise can be added by adding an intermediate layer of randomization in between the convolutional layer and the fully connected layer of a convolutional neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The global differential privacy has been the most popular approach for deep learning as the amount of noise added on the learning process is lower than the local differential privacy, which often adds overly conservative noise to maintain DP. In addition, the global differential privacy provides more flexibility in calibrating noise during the training process of a deep learning model. However, due to higher noise levels, the local differential privacy provides higher privacy levels than the global differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The literature shows solutions under both types of differential privacy with high accuracy; however, local differential privacy solutions offer higher privacy guarantees.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to FL, SL takes one step further to split the full model and its execution between clients and the server. Consequently, SL introduces an additional level of privacy to the full model, while training/testing, from the semi-honest clients and server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This is because the main server has access only to the smashed data rather than the whole client-side model updates, and it is highly unlikely to invert all the client-side model parameters up to the raw data if the configuration of the client-side model portion has a fully connected layer with sufficiently large numbers of nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. For other cases, there exist some possibilities, but this problem can be addressed by modifying the loss function at the client-side as in equation <a href="#S2.E3" title="In Information leakage and countermeasures: ‣ 2.2.2 Key results in split learning ‣ 2.2 Split learning and key results ‣ 2 Federated learning to split learning ‣ *Preprint version (before any peer-review) of a book chapter to appear in the Book series – Studies in Computational Intelligence, Book title – Federated Learning Systems: Towards Next-generation AI, Book eds.

The introduction of a local model federation server within the local bounds in the SFL architecture not only improves efficiency (e.g., training time) but also enhances privacy during the local model parameter synchronization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. The enhanced privacy is obtained because the client has access only to the aggregated client-side model updates rather than untouched client-side model updates as in SL.
To further limit privacy leaks, SFL investigates the use of differential privacy during local model training based on the differentially private deep learning approach developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which we call ADPDL.

Hence, in the initial steps, the effect of noise over the activations and smashed data is minimal. To avoid any privacy leak due to this aspect, SFL adds a noise layer after the client-side model’s cut layer.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Health data analytics have been becoming an integral part of healthcare nowadays. The analytics are powered by (deep) machine learning/artificial intelligence models. However, to train these models, usually, a considerable amount of data are required. Though the health domain has sufficient data for ML training/testing, they are generally curated in silos due to privacy concerns. Thus, distributed machine learning approaches with privacy-preservation properties, such as SL, provide better alternatives for such domains.

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, most of its vulnerabilities or privacy challenges come from untrusted entities. The entity can be a server or a client. Moreover, these entities can initiate various attacks, including model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, reconstruction attacks, membership-inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> in FL environment. To overcome this vulnerability, literature shows the application of privacy and security-enhancing techniques such as DP, secure multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. However, these are not enough in a general setting, as they suffer performance degradation like in DP, or high computation overhead like in homomorphic encryption. Thus, finding an optimal and practically feasible solution is still open.
Another prominent issue in FL is the need for constant communication with the central server. However, the distributed clients (most often) might have limited bandwidth and connectivity with the server. Hence, maintaining secure channels, maintaining a steady connection, and maintaining trust upon clients are extremely complex open challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. FL is primarily based on the SGD optimization algorithm, which is used to train deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. To guarantee an unbiased estimate of the full gradients, the data should follow IID properties. However, in real-world scenarios, it is unlikely that the datasets follow IID properties, and real-world datasets often have non-IID properties. Consequently, with skewed non-IID data, FL can show poor performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Thus, how to perform FL under a highly skewed non-IID setting in a general setting is still an active field of research. However, the technique such as <em id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS)</em> are proposed to carry federated learning with only positive labels and embedding based classifiers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the similarities in the distributed learning architectures, SL shares similar issues with FL. As the fundamental definition being the split of a network, SL’s current configurations are limited to neural network-based model architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Along with the non-neural based architectures such as support vector machines, and even neural network-based networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), it is yet to find an efficient way to split such networks to perform SL over them. However, for RNNs, split learning has been performed over the multiple clients, each containing consecutive RNN segments and a segment of sequential data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Similar to the cases of FL with non-IID data distribution, as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, SL is also susceptible to the data skewness. In terms of label distribution skew, where each client has samples all belonging to some class labels, SL also can show poor performance. Besides, SL does not learn under a one-class setup.
Compared to FL, SL may need more communications due to the additional step of local model synchronization (peer-to-peer or client-server). SL is also sensitive to data communication challenges. Similar to FL, maintaining secure channels, maintaining steady connections, and maintaining the trust upon clients are additional challenging problems in SL. Moreover, the unpredictability of a client’s status (e.g., connected, dropped, sleeping, and terminated) play a significant role in the model convergence as the client model synchronization in SL is done through a passive sequential parameter update.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The feasibility of any approach in a resource-constrained environment (e.g., smart city using IoTs) is driven by the communication efficiency of that approach. Herein, SL needs further attention. Compressing smashed data and reducing the number of communications necessary for the convergence in SL are two of the important research ventures.
Another main problem that is yet to solve fully is related to information leakage from the cut layer and countermeasures. Though there have been some works in this regard, it still needs further investigations to provide a potentially feasible solution that can limit the information leakage and maintain the utility of the model at the same time in general setup.
Client vulnerabilities (e.g., participation of vulnerable clients), server vulnerabilities (e.g. malicious servers), and communication channels issues (e.g., spoofing) are three of the architectural vulnerabilities of SL that need further investigations. Moreover, efficient incorporation of homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and DP to solve such vulnerabilities is still an open problem.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SFL is devised by amalgamating SL and FL. However, the central concept of SFL is based on SL, whereas FL is used as an effective solution for the local model synchronization. Hence, apart from the local model synchronization issues in SL, all other challenges and open problems related to SL are also common to SFL.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This chapter presented an analytical picture of the advancement in distributed learning paradigms from federated learning (FL) to split learning (SL), specifically from SL’s perspective. One of the fundamental features common to FL and SL is that they both keep the data within the control of data custodians/owners and do not require to see the raw data.
In addition to this feature, SL provides an additional capability of enabling ML model training/testing in resource-constrained client-side environments by splitting the model and allowing the clients to perform computation only on a small portion of the ML model. Besides, full model privacy is achieved while training/testing is done by a curious server or clients in SL.
FL and SL both were shown to perform well over each other in different setups and configurations. For example, SL has faster convergence, however failing to converge if the data distribution is highly skewed. Whereas FL shows some resilience in this case, and it is possibly due to its model aggregation technique, which is weighted averaging. Thus, in general, SL, FL, and a hybrid approach like splitfed learning have their own importance.
As SL is in its initial development phase, there are multiple open problems related to several aspects, including communication efficiency, model convergence, device-based vulnerabilities, and information leakage. With research inputs over time, SL will become a matured privacy-preserving distributed collaborative machine learning approach.</p>
