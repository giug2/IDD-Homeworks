<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">As a promising distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) trains a central model with decentralized data without compromising user privacy, which makes it widely used by Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) applications. However, the traditional FL suffers from model inaccuracy, since it trains local models only using hard labels of data while useful information of incorrect predictions with small probabilities is ignored. Although various solutions try to tackle the bottleneck of the traditional FL, most of them introduce significant communication overhead, making the deployment of large-scale AIoT devices a great challenge. To address the above problem, this paper presents a novel Distillation-based Federated Learning (DFL) method that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT applications. By using Knowledge Distillation (KD), in each round of FL training, our approach uploads both the soft targets and local model gradients to the cloud server for aggregation, where the aggregation results are then dispatched to AIoT devices for the next round of local training. During the DFL local training, in addition to hard labels, the model predictions approximate soft targets, which can improve model accuracy by leveraging the knowledge of soft targets. To further improve our DFL model performance, we design a dynamic adjustment strategy of loss function weights for tuning the ratio of KD and FL, which can maximize the synergy between soft targets and hard labels. Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that our approach can significantly improve the model accuracy of FL without introducing significant communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Along with the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> techniques are increasingly used in safety-critical AI IoT (AIoT) applications (e.g., autonomous driving, commercial surveillance, and industrial control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>).
Different from centralized machine learning, FL enables keeping data samples distributed while sharing the sample knowledge among all the AIoT devices.
In FL, the cloud server is responsible for dispatching and aggregating model gradients rather than collecting samples from AIoT devices through the network, which can greatly reduce the communication overhead and protect the data privacy of AIoT devices during the model training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL enables effective collaboration among AIoT devices and the cloud server, it drastically suffers from its model inaccuracy caused by the loss of knowledge during model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The optimization objective of FL local training is to minimize the distance between the correct prediction and the hard label and ignore all the incorrect predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
However, the ignoring of incorrect predictions results in the loss of knowledge since the knowledge is a learned mapping from input vectors to output vectors, and all the sample-to-prediction mappings are part of the knowledge according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The probability of incorrect predictions represents the similarities between the current sample and other different categories.
Therefore, the traditional FL based on hard labels loses some knowledge during the model training process, resulting in decreased FL model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since Knowledge Distillation (KD) can enhance the model knowledge and the model generalization ability, it is used to improve the model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
During the “student model” training process, there are two optimization objectives, i.e., hard labels of data and soft targets from the “teacher model”.
The loss function of the “student model” is defined as the sum of the cross-entropy loss function (i.e., the distance between model predictions and the corresponding hard labels of data) and the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss function (i.e., the distance between model predictions and the corresponding soft targets from the “teacher model”).
As an online paradigm of KD, Federated Distillation (FD) implements collaborative training of different device models only by interacting soft targets between the cloud server and all the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, all these methods focus more on the fundamental problems of network resource limitation for large-scale architecture rather than the FL performance improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the FL model accuracy, various methods have been proposed, e.g., global control variable-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, reinforcement learning-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, device grouping-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and KD-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
However, all these mentioned methods improve FL performance using complex reinforcement learning strategies or global variables with large sizes.
Therefore, most of them are unsuitable for AIoT applications with limited network and memory resources.
Moreover, these KD-based methods require collecting data distribution and sample categories from all devices or constructing public datasets, which brings huge risks to data privacy protection.
Therefore, how to design an efficient and accurate FL without introducing significant communication overhead and ensuring data privacy is becoming a great challenge in AIoT design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel Distillation-based FL method named DFL that can effectively enhance the model knowledge during the FL training process.
Unlike the traditional FL that only trains models based on hard labels of device samples, our proposed DFL method set two optimization objectives for the model, i.e., the hard labels of data samples and the corresponding soft targets.
We aggregate label-wise sample logits as the soft targets of the “teacher model” and dispatch them together with the global model for FL model training, which introduces negligible extra network overhead as the soft target size is always much smaller than the global model.
In this way, our DFL method can increase the model accuracy by incorporating the knowledge of soft targets into the model training.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As more and more safety-critical AIoT applications adopt FL, the FL model accuracy is becoming a major concern in AIoT design.
To improve the model accuracy, Hinton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed Kederated Distillation (KD) to enhance the model knowledge with soft targets.
To apply the benefits of KD to AIoT applications, various online versions of KD have been investigated.
For example, Anil et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed the co-distillation method with data samples shared by all the AIoT devices.
Based on FD and federated data augmentation, Jeong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> used Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> to generate a public dataset and carried out KD on the public dataset during the model training process.
By leveraging an unlabeled public dataset, Itahara et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a distillation-based semi-supervised FL algorithm that exchanges outputs of local models among mobile devices.
However, all these FD approaches above focus on reducing communication overhead rather than improving model accuracy.
Moreover, these methods with public datasets introduce risks of privacy exposure that cannot be ignored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to improve the FL model inference accuracy, various methods have been investigated.
For example, Karimireddy et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a method named SCAFFOLD, using global control variables to correct the “client-drift” in the local training process.
Similar to SCAFFOLD, Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presented a method employing the federated attentive message passing to promote more cooperation among similar devices.
However, all the two methods upload/dispatch additional large-size controllers (i.e., the global control variables and the attentive messages) along with the model gradient between the cloud server and devices.
By using built-in generators, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a data-free KD approach named FedGen to address the problem of heterogeneous FL.
Lin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed an ensemble distillation method that trains the central model with unlabeled data and the corresponding outputs of device models.
Nonetheless, these two methods are not feasible to deploy in real scenarios, since they require each device to upload their data distribution or sample categories, which brings the risk of data exposure and huge communication overhead.
Moreover, it is impractical to construct built-in generators or public datasets that are helpful for model training.
Therefore, the above methods are unsuitable for AIoT applications with data privacy requirements and limited network communication capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although KD techniques are promising in enhancing the FL performance, their combination faces the aforementioned technical challenges.
Moreover, existing distillation approaches did not consider that the knowledge of soft targets changes with the model training process.
Generally, the knowledge of soft targets increases with the number of training rounds since the model accuracy is improved.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt that fully explores the synergy between the model gradients and global soft targets to further enable knowledge sharing among AIoT devices.
Due to the enhanced knowledge obtained by soft targets using our proposed architecture and dynamic adjustment strategy, the accuracy of DFL models can be significantly improved, while the communication overhead is negligible.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, an AIoT application involves a cloud server and plenty of AIoT devices, where each AIoT device has limited communication and memory capacities.
In this paper, we focus on the model performance rather than the problem of incentive or fairness.
Therefore, we assume that at the beginning of our DFL architecture deployment, data samples are collected by each device and used for local model training.
The model to be trained is initially placed on the cloud server and dispatched to AIoT devices at the beginning of each training round.
Since soft targets can enhance the model knowledge and the model generalization ability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, our approach introduces KD into our architecture to improve the model accuracy.
Unlike existing FD methods, our DFL approach uploads/dispatches model gradients and soft targets (generated using local samples in the previous round) simultaneously during the interaction between AIoT devices and the cloud server.
When a new device joins the AIoT application, it will receive the latest global model and soft targets from the cloud server and perfectly fit into the DFL model training.
The proposed DFL model training procedure is divided into two parts: i) the cloud server training part, which includes the dispatching, aggregation, and update of both model gradients and soft targets, and ii) the local training part, which trains local models using both local samples and dispatched soft targets.
Once the local training finishes, an AIoT device needs to figure out new label-wise sample logits for the following aggregation.
The following subsections will detail the key components and the convergence analysis of our DFL approach.</p>

It mainly consists of a central cloud server and plenty of AIoT devices.
To guarantee data privacy, data samples are collected by AIoT devices and cannot be shared with other devices and the cloud server.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Our DFL Approach ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our DFL architecture has three parts, i.e., the FL processing part (marked in yellow), the Soft Target Processing Module (STPM) in the cloud server (marked in blue), and the STPM in AIoT devices (marked in red).
Our approach uses STPM in the cloud server to aggregate the label-wise sample logits as the global soft targets and dispatches them to selected AIoT devices.
The STPM in AIoT devices involves three functions: i) receiving the global soft targets from the cloud server; ii) performing local training using both the global soft targets and the hard labels of local samples; and iii) generating new label-wise sample logits using updated local models.
The details of the FL processing part are neglected here since they are similar to that of the traditional FL.
Note that designers can customize the models they need to train according to the requirements and available resources of AIoT applications.</p>

The local update procedure of our DFL approach involves two stages, i.e., the local training stage and the new label-wise sample logit generation stage.
Similar to FedAvg, the predictions of our DFL model approximate the hard labels of local samples.
To further improve the model accuracy, our approach makes the model predictions approximate to the soft targets related to the corresponding hard labels as well.
Therefore, to make wisely use of the knowledge of both hard labels and soft targets, we design our loss function in model training as follows:</p>

Steps 5-6 iteratively update the model weight, where the loss function is defined in Formulas <a href="#S3.E3" title="In III-B2 Local Update Procedure ‣ III-B Training Procedure of DFL ‣ III Our DFL Approach ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
After the local training stage finishes, steps 7-9 generate the label-wise sample logits.
To save network resources, step 9 calculates the model gradient for upload.
Finally, step 10 uploads the model gradient and label-wise sample logits to the cloud server for aggregation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ratio of the two-loss functions plays an important role in DFL local training since the weight of soft targets greatly impacts the model training.
Generally, the knowledge of soft targets depends on the model accuracy, and the model accuracy increases as the number of training rounds increases.
Therefore, there is insufficient knowledge of soft targets in the early stage of the model training process since the model is randomly initialized.
In this case, the soft targets will make the model optimize in the wrong direction, which will slow down the model training.
The knowledge of soft targets increases as the training continues, which can enhance the model with the knowledge that the hard labels do not have.
However, the model training cannot rely mainly on soft targets according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, we need to set a threshold <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{T}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒯</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝒯</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{T}</annotation></semantics></math> to fix the ratio of the two-loss functions in the late stage of the model training process so that the model can achieve the best performance.
To maximize the use of the soft targets and reduce their side effects, we design a dynamic adjustment strategy to control the loss function ratio as follows:</p>

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> designed CNN models for MNIST and CIFAR-10.
For the FEMNIST dataset, we modified the output of the MNIST CNN model to <math id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="62" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">62</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">62</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">62</annotation></semantics></math>, which is the labels of the samples.
For the CIFAR-100 dataset, we modified the output of the CIFAR-10 CNN model to <math id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math>, which is the coarse-grained labels of the samples.
The Torchvision platform can provide the corresponding model interfaces according to the benchmarks we set.
Therefore, the structure of these three models was fine-tuned according to different benchmarks.</p>

Then, we investigate the impact of the loss function ratio and find the empirical optimal ratio of the two-loss functions with a series of experiments.
To avoid the interference of random model initialization and out-of-order dataset training on the experimental results, we ran each experiment ten times and took its mean value for a fair comparison.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the first experiment, we compared the performance of our method with four baseline methods using the IID scenario set in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III-D Convergence Analysis of Our DFL Approach ‣ III Our DFL Approach ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
During the model training process of all the five methods, we tested the inference accuracy of the global models after each round of model aggregation in the cloud server.
The model accuracy is equal to the ratio of the correctly predicted samples over the total testing samples using the cloud aggregated model.
Due to the space limitation, we show the model accuracy trends using the CNN model on three benchmarks (i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) along with the number of training rounds in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
For each figure, the X-axis denotes the number of training rounds, and the Y-axis indicates the model accuracy.
Five curves with different colors represent the trends of the model inference accuracy of five different methods.

When the model accuracy does not increase significantly, we believe that the model converges.
Since the FD method converges difficultly, we adaptively present the model convergence process of other methods in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we can find that our DFL method achieves the highest model accuracy compared with the other four methods on all three benchmarks.
Since our dynamic adjustment strategy gives the soft targets a small proportion in the early stage of model training, we can greatly reduce the side effects on model convergence caused by the insufficient knowledge of soft targets.
We increase the proportion of the soft targets along with the training process, which can improve the model accuracy by maximizing the knowledge of soft targets.
Therefore, our method can effectively improve the model inference accuracy without slowing down the model convergence rate.
The model accuracy improvement of SCAFFOLD for the IID scenario is insignificant, and the model convergence speed of SCAFFOLD slows down.
This is mainly because the added randomly-initialized global variable misleads the optimization direction of the model in the early stage of model training.
FedGen uses its built-in generators to generate extra samples, thereby speeding up model training.
However, the samples generated by the generators of FedGen is naive, which will decrease the model accuracy in the late stage of the model training.</p>

This is mainly because the soft targets added by our method can improve the model inference accuracy effectively by enhancing the model knowledge.
The global variables added in the SCAFFOLD method are based on the data distribution relationships among the AIoT devices to guide the model optimization direction of each AIoT device.
Therefore, this method does not greatly improve the model inference accuracy for the IID scenario.
Since the knowledge of the soft targets of FD is less than that of the model gradient, the FD model accuracy is lower than the FedAvg model accuracy.
Note that the generators of FedGen can only generate simple data.
Therefore, the model accuracy of this method becomes worse as the dataset becomes more complex.</p>

For example, when training the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our DFL method outperforms FedAvg, SCAFFOLD and FedGen by <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="7.06\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">7.06</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">7.06</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1c">7.06\%</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="5.73\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">5.73</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">5.73</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1c">5.73\%</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="9.68\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">9.68</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">9.68</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.3.m3.1c">9.68\%</annotation></semantics></math>, respectively.
The reason why our approach is superior is mainly because the added soft targets can enhance model knowledge, which is effective for both IID and non-IID scenarios.
Therefore, the local training process can use the knowledge of soft targets to improve the model accuracy.
Note that the model accuracy of the FD method is <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="11.53\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">11.53</mn><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1.1.2">11.53</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.4.m4.1c">11.53\%</annotation></semantics></math> for this case, which is similar to that of a randomly initialized model.
This is mainly because the knowledge of soft targets is insufficient to train a model.
Therefore, the model trained by FD using soft targets alone is inaccurate.</p>

The network resources occupied by SCAFFOLD are always twice that of FedAvg due to the additional global variable of each AIoT device.
FedGen needs to dispatch both built-in generators and model gradients, where the size of generators is shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-B2 Performance Comparison for Non-IID Scenarios ‣ IV-B Performance Evaluation ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.
Although the information interaction of FD occupies few network resources, the model trained by FD is inaccurate, which makes it unable to be deployed in the AIoT applications.
The communication cost of our DFL method equals the sum of FedAvg and FD since our method adds soft targets based on FedAvg.
The size of soft targets is only determined by the number of categories of datasets (i.e., <math id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3.2" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">3.2</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">3.2</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">3.2</annotation></semantics></math> KB for CIFAR-100 and <math id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.8" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0.8</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="float" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">0.8</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1c">0.8</annotation></semantics></math> KB for the other benchmarks).
Therefore, the larger the training model, the smaller the proportion of communication cost increased by our method than FedAvg.

To investigate the impacts of dynamic adjustment strategy, we conducted a series of experiments to verify the role of loss function ratio in different stages of model training.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Impacts of Dynamic Adjustment Strategy ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning for AIoT Applications Using Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we can find that the model accuracy of DFL-DRwT and DFL-DRw/T increases rapidly in the early stage of training while the DFL-FR model accuracy increases slowly.
This is mainly because the knowledge of soft targets is insufficient in the early stage of model training, which can mislead the model optimization direction.
The knowledge of soft targets increases as the model trains.
In the late stage of training, there is sufficient knowledge of soft targets to guide the model training.
Therefore, assigning a higher proportion to soft targets is beneficial to the model training as the number of training rounds increases.
However, the model accuracy drops sharply in the final stage of the DFL-DRw/T model training.
This is mainly because the proportion of hard labels is too small, and the model trained with soft targets alone is inaccurate.
Therefore, we need to control the ratio between the two-loss functions to achieve the best model performance after the soft targets gain sufficient knowledge.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although Federated Learning (FL) techniques are becoming popular in Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) applications, they are suffering from the problem of model inaccuracy.
How to improve the model accuracy of FL under the limited network bandwidth and memory resources is becoming a major bottleneck in the design of AIoT applications.
To address the above problem, this paper presents a novel FL architecture based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) named DFL, which can increase the model generalization ability.
By adding soft targets to each round of model training, our proposed approach can increase the inference accuracy of the FL model without introducing significant communication and memory overhead.
To further improve the performance of our DFL model, we designed a strategy to dynamically adjust the ratio of the two loss functions in KD to maximize the use of knowledge of soft targets.
Comprehensive experimental results on four well-known benchmarks prove the effectiveness of our approach.
For future work, we need to consider a better dynamic adjustment strategy, where the loss function ratio is controlled by the feedback of the model accuracy.</p>
