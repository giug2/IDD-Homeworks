<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm, particularly tackling the heterogeneity issues brought by various mobile user equipments (UEs) in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, due to the ever-increasing number of UEs and the complicated administrative work it brings, it is desirable to switch the PFL algorithm from its conventional two-layer framework to a multiple-layer one. In this paper, we propose hierarchical PFL (HPFL), an algorithm for deploying PFL over massive MEC networks. The UEs in HPFL are divided into multiple clusters, and the UEs in each cluster forward their local updates to the edge server (ES) synchronously for edge model aggregation, while the ESs forward their edge models to the cloud server semi-asynchronously for global model aggregation. The above training manner leads to a tradeoff between the training loss in each round and the round latency. HPFL combines the objectives of training loss minimization and round latency minimization while jointly determining the optimal bandwidth allocation as well as the ES scheduling policy in the hierarchical learning framework. Extensive experiments verify that HPFL not only guarantees convergence in hierarchical aggregation frameworks but also has advantages in round training loss maximization and round latency minimization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables multiple mobile user equipments (UEs) to jointly train a common model without ever uploading their raw data to a central parameter server (PS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">1</span></a>]</cite>.
FL has already shown its great potential in exploring behavior patterns hidden in the large amount of data generated by UEs, such as intelligent vehicles, smartphones, and wearable devices.
These patterns, also known as model parameters, will provide guidance to newcomers, thus fostering significant applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">2</span></a>]</cite> and autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>.
Despite the tremendous benefits FL brings to edge intelligence, model training in <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">heterogenous</em> and potentially <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">massive</em> mobile edge computing (MEC) networks introduces novel challenges that require a fundamental departure from conventional approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Conventionally, FL algorithms are implemented in a two-layer framework with a central PS and multiple distributed UEs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">5</span></a>]</cite>.
Using the on-device datasets, UEs train local models in reference to the current global model, which are then collected by the PS to further improve the global model.
The PS will then feed the new model back to UEs for a new round of local updating.
However, this typical two-layer framework does not scale well to large-scale FL settings, which are inevitable over massive MEC networks.
This is because, (i) the communication and computation resources in a MEC system are limited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">6</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>]</cite>. Direct communications between UEs and the remote PS will slow down the overall training due to the scarce resources allocated to each UE;
(ii) the number of UEs ranges from thousands to billions. Such a humongous number of UEs makes it hard for the PS to manage and monitor the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>]</cite>.
Therefore, a two-layer framework is not enough, and a multi-layer FL framework emerges as a pragmatic solution for large-scale FL implementation in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">10</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">12</span></a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, datasets generated by UEs are characterized by a high degree of diversity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">13</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">14</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">15</span></a>]</cite>. Not only does the number of data samples generated by UEs vary, but these data samples are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d). Learning from such heterogeneous data is difficult, as conventional FL algorithms usually develop a <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">common</em> model for all UEs such that the obtained global model could perform arbitrarily poorly on a specific UE. This situation worsens with the rapid development of end-user devices’ sensing and computation capabilities. Therefore, it is desired for the FL algorithm to provide personalized services to individual UEs by conducting adaptations to the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the extensive studies on personalized algorithms of FL, remarkably little is known about their implementations in a hierarchical framework. Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">16</span></a>]</cite> proposed the first work in providing personalized FL services to UEs, named Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). It is an approach that learns an <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">initial</em> model that is good enough for all UEs to start with. Using this initial model, each UE can conduct fast adaptation to its local dataset using only a few data points. As a result, the UEs can enjoy fast personalized models by adapting the global model to local datasets. From PFL, a string of follow-ups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">17</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">18</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">19</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">20</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">21</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">22</span></a>]</cite> modified, developed and extended PFL. However, their focus has been primarily on a two-layer or non-hierarchical FL framework. It is <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unclear</em> how to implement PFL in a hierarchical framework, considering limited communication and computational resources in MEC networks, and whether PFL can converge with such an implementation.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a PFL algorithm for massive MEC networks, named hierarchical PFL (HPFL), which conducts fast adaptations with hierarchical aggregations.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, HPFL considers a learning framework that consists of three layers, i.e., the UE, edge server (ES), and central server (CS) layers.
Each ES, which serves multiple UEs and can be co-located with small cell base stations, <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">synchronously</em> aggregates local models that are trained and sent by UEs.
The CS is connected to a macro base station, <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">semi-asynchronously</em> aggregates edge models that are sent by ESs. More specifically, after receiving the current global model, UEs train and update their local models using their datasets. The updated local models are then transmitted to the ES for synchronous edge aggregation. Then, the updated edge models are further transmitted to the CS for semi-asynchronous global model aggregation and update. The updated global model will then be sent back to individual UEs in the same way they came.
A full round of this procedure constitutes one communication round, and the system repeats such interactions until HPFL converges.
With hierarchical aggregations, limited resources are released to serve more UEs, making it much easier for the HPFL scheduler to manage the massive MEC networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The semi-asynchronous training across ESs leads to a tradeoff between the per round training loss and the round latency over resource-limited MEC networks.
To that end, our objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the round training loss and the round latency by jointly optimizing ES scheduling policy and bandwidth allocation.
To make the formulated optimization problem tractable, we first analyze the convergence of HPFL. Based on the analysis results, we decompose the optimization problem as a separate ES scheduling problem and bandwidth allocation problem and solve them, respectively. With the obtained results, we can implement HPFL over MEC networks to provide efficient hierarchical training services.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.4" class="ltx_p">Regarding large-scale learning tasks, HFL becomes a natural choice for collecting information from a swarm of mobile UEs.
These edge nodes are divided into multiple small areas based on their geographical locations. The small areas are generally separated by tens of kilometers, and each small area contains thousands of UEs.
Therefore, the hierarchical architecture for large-scale FL usually contains at least three tiers (cf. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
Usually, an edge server is in charge of a small area, whereas UEs in this small area will train their local models and then send their updates to the edge server.
The edge server aggregates local models and then updates its edge model.

For simplicity of notation, we consider only one gradient update in the formula and for the rest of the paper, but using multiple local iterations is a straightforward extension. It is also worth noting that we use the full-batch gradient descent to update the local model. In practice, this is not the usual case. Schedulers are encouraged to sample mini-batch of data points on each UE since the volume of data generated by UEs is too large to be processed. While not the focus of this work, the analysis of mini-batch gradient decent can naturally be combined with the methods proposed herein.</p>

Nevertheless, it is easy to extend the situation from SNR to SINR. This is because only system parameters that can be measured by channel estimation methods are introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">25</span></a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that in this paper, an ES is designed to aggragate local models synchronouly. UEs are randomly selected in each round to transmit their local updates until all selected UEs arrive at the ES for edge model aggragation. This is because the cover range of an ES is small, especially in 5G and B5G networks. For example, the cover range of a BS that supports millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication is usually around 100 m <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">26</span></a>]</cite>. UEs are sparsely scattered within the coverage of each ES and it is convenient to schedule these UEs synchronously while training.</p>

Aggregating edge models semi-asynchronously is the result of the tradeoff between the latency and the training accuracy. On the one hand, if the CS aggregates the updates from ESs synchronously, the latency between ESs and the CS is determined by the latest ES that finishes its data transmission to the cloud. The long distance between ESs and the CS would make this latency unacceptable. On the other hand, if the CS aggregates the updates asynchronously, the learning algorithm may not converge due the staleness caused by those late ESs with out-of-date updates. As a result, for a massive mobile edge network that might suffer unacceptable long round latency as well as learning accuracy, we choose to aggregate edge models semi-asynchronously at the CS.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For massive MEC networks, it is desirable to attain a fast convergence for the learning process.
Therefore, in each round, our goal for the cloud server is to aggregate updates from as many ESs as possible. However, the more ESs that are selected, the longer round latency is likely to be.
As a result, we try to find a tradeoff between the amount of information uploaded by the selected ESs in a certain round and the round latency, which is formalized as follows <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>Besides bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy, other decision variables such like transmit power can also be included in the problem formulation. The logic keeps the same, but the parameters that need to be considered might change. Problem (P1) shows the case when we consider the bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy as variables, and it is free for the researchers to extend this general formulation to other forms.</span></span></span>,</p>

For a given set of bandwidth allocation, what we need to do is to compute and compare the above two values for each of the ESs, and then determine whether an ES is to be scheduled in this round or not. This makes it easy and fast for practical implementation of ES selection. The pseudo-code of the ES scheduling algorithm is detailed in Alg. <a href="#algorithm1" title="In VI-B Edge Server Scheduling ‣ VI Joint Edge Server Scheduling and Bandwidth Allocation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, and it is named <span id="S6.SS2.p7.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ESScheduling</span>.

Specifically, we compare HPFL with the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) algorithm when ESs are selected in the mode we proposed in this paper, fully selected and randomly selected.
In brief, we compare the performance of HPFL with five other algorithms, namely, HFL with the proposed ES selection mode, HFL with fully selected ESs, HFL with randomly selected ESs, HPFL with fully selected ESs, and HPFL with randomly selected ESs.</p>

On the contrary, the larger the test accuracy is, the better the algorithm behaves.
Meanwhile, for the implementation performance of HPFL over MEC networks, we measure HPFL’s round latency and its total data importance collected in each round.
We also measure the runtime of implementing HPFL in MEC networks compared with intuitive algorithms with no needs to compute the ES scheduling policy and bandwidth allocation.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We begin with evaluating the convergence performance of the six algorithms: HFL and HPFL with fully selected ESs, randomly selected ESs and the proposed ES selection mode, respectively.
Fig. <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VII-A3 Baselines ‣ VII-A Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the convergence performance of the six algorithms under the MNIST dataset, while Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VII-A3 Baselines ‣ VII-A Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the same convergence performance using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
From both figures, we observe that the algorithms with fully selected ESs always outperform the others.
This aligns with our intuition as all-in training provides information about all ESs and all UEs.
We also notice that the algorithms with randomly selected ESs behave the worst. This is also a reasonable result because ESs that are randomly selected can not always provide the most effective information for the global model training.
Meanwhile, all the HPFL algorithms outperform the HFL algorithms since the HPFL always behaves well in dealing with heterogeneous datasets. This result provides another proof of PFL’s advantage in fast convergence, even though it is implemented using hierarchical aggregations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the MNIST dataset, it is a simple dataset that is easy to train. Therefore, if HPFL performs well, its behavior should be pretty close to the optimal one, where all ESs are selected in each communication round. The results shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VII-A3 Baselines ‣ VII-A Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> just prove the above point, that the proposed ES scheduling scheme gives almost the same result as the fully selected ES scheme.
Moreover, as we can observe from Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VII-A3 Baselines ‣ VII-A Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> where the CIFAR-10 dataset is considered, the convergence performance of algorithms with fully selected ESs is more stable than that of algorithms with the proposed ES selection method and the randomly selected ESs, while the algorithms with randomly selected ESs behave the worst. This is a reasonable result, that an all-in UE selection mode contains data information from all UEs, whereas a randomly UE selection mode may leave out important data information. Besides, algorithms with the proposed ES selection method attempt to pick up the UEs with more data importance in each rounds, thereby leading to a convergence performance in between.</p>

However, as for the HPFL algorithm with the proposed ES selected mode, the average round latency and the total data importance captured in each round increase as the value of <math id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rho" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">ρ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝜌</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1c">\rho</annotation></semantics></math> increases.
This is a reasonable result because, as the weight factor increases, it is desired for the scheduler to choose ESs with larger total data importance. Therefore, as we can see in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8.sf2" title="In Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Convergence Performance ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8b</span></a>, the larger <math id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rho" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1a"><mi id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">ρ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1b"><ci id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1">𝜌</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1c">\rho</annotation></semantics></math> is, the more total data importance gathered in each round. At the same time, as the HPFL’s objective function indicates, more selected data importance means larger round latency, and the result shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Convergence Performance ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> exactly verifies this point of view.</p>

We name this simple hierarchical PFL algorithm as SHPFL. Meanwhile, the runtime is measured as the average duration when <span id="S7.SS4.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">BandwidthAllocation</span> and <span id="S7.SS4.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ESScheduling</span> algorithms are triggered in each round. There is no need for SHPFL to compute the ES scheduling policy and the bandwidth allocation problem. Therefore, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F11.sf1" title="In Figure 11 ‣ VII-D Algorithm Runtime Performance ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11a</span></a>, as the number of selected ESs increases, the average runtime of SHPFL in each round keeps constant, while that of HPFL grows linearly.
Moreover, the average runtime in each round of HPFL algorithms is at least <math id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="60\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1b"><mn id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1">60</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS4.p1.4.m4.1c">60\times</annotation></semantics></math> larger than that of SHPFL. This indicates that to save more round latency and capture more data information, HPFL sacrifices its runtime for better convergence and implementation performance. Nevertheless, the consumed runtime (in tens of milliseconds) of our proposed HPFL is acceptable since it is much smaller than the average round time (in tens of seconds).</p>

<p id="S7.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S7.F11.sf2" title="In Figure 11 ‣ VII-D Algorithm Runtime Performance ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning Over Massive Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11b</span></a> shows the tradeoff between average round runtime and the training loss drop along with the communication rounds. It is obvious that for the proposed HPFL algorithm, the average round runtime and the training loss drop are positively correlated. This is a reasonable result, since as the communication rounds increases, the training loss drop decreases. According to the ES scheduling algorithm, the number of selected ESs in each round decreases with the decreasing of the training loss drop, thereby leading to the reduction of average round runtime. However, for the SHPFL algorithm, the average round runtime does not change and has no relationship witht eh training loss drop. This is also a reasonable result, since there is no need for SHPFL to compute the ES scheduling policy and the bandwidth allocation problem.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the hierarchical PFL mechanism for massive MEC networks.
We have proposed HPFL, a hierarchical PFL algorithm that adapts quickly to individual UEs with hierarchical aggregations.
HPFL is implemented in a three-layer MEC network, where ESs aggregates the edge models synchronously, and the CS fuses the global model update in a semi-asynchronous manner.
The semi-asynchronous aggregation at the CS brings a tradeoff between the round training loss and the round latency. HPFL combines the objectives of training loss maximization and round latency minimization while determining the ES scheduling policy and bandwidth allocation.
This optimization problem is solved by firstly analyzing the convergence of HPFL, thus transforming the problem into a tractable one. Then, we decoupled the problem into an ES scheduling problem and a bandwidth allocation problem, and solved them separately. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that not only HPFL is convergent, but provides a tradeoff in maximizing the round training loss and minimizing the round latency.</p>
