<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning aims to construct a global model that fits the dataset distributed across local devices without direct access to private data,
leveraging communication between a server and the local devices. In the context of a practical communication scheme, we study the completion
time required to achieve a target performance. Specifically, we analyze the number of iterations required for federated learning to reach a specific
optimality gap from a minimum global loss. Subsequently, we characterize the time required for each iteration under two fundamental multiple
access schemes: time-division multiple access (TDMA) and random access (RA). We propose a step-wise batch allocation, demonstrated to be
optimal for TDMA-based federated learning systems. Additionally, we show that the non-zero batch gap between devices provided by the
proposed step-wise batch allocation significantly reduces the completion time for RA-based learning systems. Numerical evaluations validate
these analytical results through real-data experiments, highlighting the remarkable potential for substantial completion time reduction.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to an explosive increase in the number of IoT devices. It is estimated that the
number of IoT connections will surpass 34 billion by 2023, according to Ericsson’s recent report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This exponential growth
in IoT devices has resulted in the generation of vast volumes of data. Simultaneously, the dramatic evolution of machine learning techniques,
particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), has opened new avenues for harnessing the wealth of data generated by these devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, due to the vast scale of IoT datasets, constructing a single centralized machine for storage and processing becomes impractical.
Furthermore, numerous types of data generated by IoT, such as financial and health information, are personal and highly sensitive. This naturally
results in data owners being hesitant to grant access to centralized entities.
To address such challenges of handling large-scale data while preserving data privacy, federated learning has emerged as a promising solution
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In a federated learning system, a central server coordinates the learning process, while local devices compute models,
i.e., artificial neural network models, using their own locally stored data. Importantly, no data is exchanged between the server and the devices.
Instead, the local models computed by the devices are transmitted to the server. Upon receiving these local models, the server aggregates them to
produce a global model, which is subsequently sent back to the devices for the next iteration. This iterative process continues, ultimately resulting in
the training of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key advantages of federated learning is that it does not require direct access to local data. The server constructs the global model by
aggregating local models, making it well-suited for applications involving sensitive or private data. Furthermore, since the entire dataset is distributed
across numerous devices, the computational load on each device is substantially lower than that in centralized learning. This distributed nature of
federated learning also enables the exploitation of parallel computing techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, a limitation of federated learning is that no single entity can access the entire dataset. Consequently, updating the global model in each
iteration may be less efficient compared to centralized counterparts, often requiring more iterations to achieve the desired performance. Additionally,
communication is essential in each iteration, as local models must be transmitted from the devices to the server, and the updated global model is
sent from the server to the devices. This communication overhead can become a bottleneck in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, researchers have focused on developing communication-efficient federated learning techniques. Notable
approaches include Federated Averaging (FedAvg), which aggregates local models from a subset of devices to reduce communication overhead
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors have proposed an updates scheme that compresses parameters of
local models to reduce communication cost.
In addition, strategies involving periodic transmission of local models have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to decrease
communication frequency. Some methods have even leveraged primal-dual optimization techniques to further reduce communication requirements
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another approach seeks to minimize the number of communications by introducing event-triggered aggregation, where local models are sent to the
server only when the difference between the most recently sent model and the current local model exceeds a predefined threshold
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This approach aligns with the development of decentralized systems that address optimization problems in a distributed manner
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to that, another line of research focuses on resource optimization for enhancing bandwidth and energy efficiency. Energy-efficient
strategies have considered the amount of energy used in both transmission and computation, leading to solutions that minimize energy consumption
for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Bandwidth allocation schemes that select users with a probability distribution have
also been explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Further work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> has aimed to jointly optimize power and bandwidth allocation
to minimize energy and time requirements. Furthermore, the impact of the number of participating devices on communication costs and computing
loads has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, with an exploration of the optimal number of devices for federated learning systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance the efficiency of model training, adaptive batch sizes to accelerate convergence behavior and reduce the number of required iterations
have been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In particular, techniques such as deep reinforcement learning have been
employed to determine batch sizes, aligning them with the capabilities of individual devices. Furthermore, optimizing the exponential factor
governing batch size increases has been explored to minimize the required time of federated learning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth mentioning that existing literature often assumes uniform batch sizes across all participating devices, resulting in the simultaneous
transmission of their locally updated models. This can lead to excessive interference and congestion for local model transmission at each device,
particularly when dealing with a large number of devices. In light of these challenges, our research is centered on heterogeneous batch allocation,
where different batch sizes are assigned to individual devices. This heterogeneous allocation naturally introduces variability in the time duration
required for updating local models on different devices, thereby reducing the effective number of devices accessing the wireless channel and
mitigating communication overhead. To the best of our knowledge, strategies that allocate different batch sizes to each of devices have not been
thoroughly investigated. Additionally, we consider two fundamental multiple access schemes: time-division multiple access (TDMA) and random
access (RA) for transmitting local models to the server. For clarity, our contributions are summarized as follows.

focus is on the completion time required to obtain an updated global model at the server, approaching the optimal state within a certain gap. To
measure the completion time, we adopt a time-slotted model where each time slot is defined as a specific duration. Consequently, by counting the
number of time slots needed to establish the optimal model, we can measure the completion time for federated learning.</p>

2) local updating at each device based on its own data; 3) transmission of an updated model from each device to the server; 4) aggregation of
updated models at the server. For model distribution, the server can broadcast an aggregated model to all devices using a downlink shared channel.

description.
For simplicity, we assume that each slot duration is normalized such that a single model can be transmitted from a device to the server. However, as
multiple devices participate in federated learning, a multiple access protocol between devices is required to send their updated models. In this paper,
we consider two fundamental multiple access schemes: TDMA and RA.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of TDMA, a central scheduler can allocate distinct time slots for each of the devices, thereby avoiding interference or collisions that might
occur due to simultaneous transmissions from multiple devices. On the other hand, RA allows each device to decide
its transmission in a distributed manner, so that collisions can occur. Thus, each device is required to repeatedly transmit its updated model with a
certain
probability until successful transmission occurs. The detailed analysis on the communication time for both TDMA and RA will

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When RA is employed for transmitting updated models, the time duration for computation and communication affects the expected iteration time, as

If the server assigns equal-size batches to all devices, the time required for local updates is reduced by leveraging
parallel computing. However, after updating the models, all devices will simultaneously attempt transmission, leading to longer communication times
due to heavy contention.
On the other hand, if there are variations in batch sizes allocated to devices, the time slot when the last device with the largest batch size completes
its updates can be delayed. However, devices with smaller batch sizes will have opportunities to transmit updated models while other devices are still
in the process of updating their models.</p>

applying the ceiling operation to ‘Opt. with integer relaxation’. Due to integer constraints, a gap from the theoretically optimal point obtained under
integer relaxation is inevitable. However, this gap can be considered negligible.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we thoroughly investigated completion time, representing the time required for federated learning over a wireless channel to achieve a
predefined performance for a machine learning model. In our pursuit of characterizing completion time, we derived the number of iterations
necessary to reach the desired performance level and analyzed the time duration for each iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In scenarios where the server can allocate time slots for communication with each device, we introduced a novel batch allocation algorithm. Our
research has conclusively demonstrated the optimality of this proposed algorithm in minimizing completion time.
Moreover, when random access is employed, the use of identical batch sizes results in a high number of packet collisions, leading to extended
duration for each iteration. To address this issue and further reduce completion time, we introduced a batch allocation algorithm that leverages batch
gaps between devices. By allowing different batch sizes for each device, we successfully mitigated contention for channel access. As a result, the
step-wise batch allocation approach, incorporating suitable batch gaps while considering factors such as batch size, computing speed, and
transmission probability, emerges as a promising strategy for reducing completion time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our findings underscore the importance of optimizing wireless federated learning systems from a holistic perspective that encompasses both
communication and computation aspects. The synergy between these two domains is crucial for achieving efficient and effective federated learning
over wireless networks.</p>
