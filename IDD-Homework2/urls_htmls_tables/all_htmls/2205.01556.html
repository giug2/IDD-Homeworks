In this work, in a federated setting, we consider random participation of the clients in addition to subsampling their local datasets. Since such random participation of the clients creates correlation among the samples of the same client in their subsampling, we analyze the corresponding privacy amplification via non-uniform subsampling. We show that when the size of the local datasets is small, the privacy guarantees via random participation is close to those of the centralized setting, in which the entire dataset is located in a single host and subsampled. On the other hand, when the local datasets are large, observing the output of the algorithm may disclose the identities of the sampled clients with high confidence. Our analysis reveals that, even in this case, privacy guarantees via random participation outperform those via only local subsampling.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) framework allows several clients to collaboratively and iteratively learn from each other’s data with the coordination of a parameter server (PS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahan et al., 2017</a>]</cite>. In a typical scenario, the PS averages the model updates received from clients based on their local data. Then, it updates the global model and broadcasts the updated global model back to clients for the next iteration. In this learning model, since the data itself never leaves the participating clients, in terms of privacy, the FL framework is usually perceived as superior to centralized training, in which entire data is offloaded to a central server. Although this is true to some extent, many recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Melis et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx31" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zhu et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Geiping et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Carlini et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">Salem et al., 2020</a>]</cite> have shown that the model updates from the clients as well as the final deployed model can leak many features of the clients’ local datasets, including reconstruction of some data samples used for training. Therefore, additional mechanisms with formal and quantifiable privacy guarantees need to be employed in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dwork et al., 2014</a>]</cite> is the gold standard quantifying the privacy leakage in privacy-preserving data analysis tasks. It is a measure of the indistinguishability between two outputs of an algorithm when two neighboring datasets are fed into the algorithm as inputs. A deterministic algorithm can be made differentially private by randomizing its output as long as the introduced randomness is independent from the input and secret to the adversary. Output perturbation via an additive noise such as Gaussian or Laplace noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dwork et al., 2006</a>]</cite> is a common example of such randomization techniques. However, there exist other sources of randomness that do not guarantee indistinguishability alone, but they can amplify the final DP guarantees when they are cascaded with techniques already guaranteeing DP. <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Subsampling</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chaudhuri and Mishra, 2006</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Balle et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mironov et al., 2019</a>]</cite> and <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">shuffling</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Erlingsson et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Feldman et al., 2020</a>]</cite> are among the most prominent of such tools. In subsampling, a random subset from the original dataset is sampled to be used as the input to the privacy-preserving mechanism. In shuffling, on the other hand, the outputs resulting from different inputs are randomly shuffled so that mapping between the inputs and the outputs are masked, resulting in anonymized outputs. Such privacy amplification techniques further confuse an adversary when used in conjunction with output perturbation techniques, and the amplified privacy guarantees are achieved without sacrificing the utility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider a FL setting with distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) using a trusted PS, in which formal DP guarantees are achieved for all intermediate models including the final deployed one. For this, we update the global model by the average of the gradients collected from participating clients, which is perturbed via an additive Gaussian noise, following the seminal work of Abadi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Abadi et al., 2016</a>]</cite>. To further amplify the privacy guarantee, we consider two types of sampling: (1) client sampling, and (2) local dataset sampling. In each iteration, first, available clients during that iteration randomly decide whether to participate or not, independently from the decisions of other clients. Then, each client that decides to participate samples a subset from its local dataset such that each element is sampled independently from the other elements in the local dataset. That is, in both sampling phases, we employ Poisson sampling separately. Analysing the privacy amplification guarantee of this sampling technique in a federated setting is challenging. More specifically, random participation of the clients introduces correlation between the elements located in a single client in their sampling. For example, given an element is sampled from a specific client, the probability of another element being sampled from the same client is larger than the probability of another element from another client being sampled. Therefore, employing random participation of clients and local dataset sampling together poses a non-uniform sampling problem, and in this work, we analyse the central DP guarantees of such a setting.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Related Work and Motivation</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For FL scenarios with many participants, sampling the participating clients is essential for efficient use of the power and the communication resources even when privacy is not a constraint. Consider a learning problem with millions of mobile devices. Thousands of iterations are carried out in a typical learning task, and if each mobile device participates in every iteration, the power spent on the computations and the extra communication to transmit the results to the PS will result in a very large overall energy cost. In addition, communication overhead of such a dense participation may cause congestion in the communication networks; and thus, is not scalable. Moreover, for the learning tasks employing mini-batch optimization techniques, limited number of samples per iteration is preferable. Hence, client sampling can help to reach the targeted batch size in addition to the local dataset sampling. All these aforementioned benefits make client sampling one of the indispensable components of FL, whose effect on the convergence and final performance of FL algorithms have been widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ruan et al., 2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cho et al., 2020</a>]</cite>. In addition to these benefits, since it brings additional randomness to the training procedure, it is expected to bring some additional amplification to the DP guarantees. Hence, rather than proposing the inclusion of a new mechanism to amplify DP guarantees, in this work, our goal is to utilize an already-employed mechanism to improve the privacy guarantees of the task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Differentially private deep learning in a centralized setting is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Abadi et al., 2016</a>]</cite>. The authors employ Poisson subsampling of the dataset and the gradient of every sample is clipped and Gaussian noise is added to it. They further introduce the moments accountant technique to calculate the composition of the total privacy leakage throughout the iterations. Similar techniques to those in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Abadi et al., 2016</a>]</cite> are extended to the federated setting in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">Geyer et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahan et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">Seif et al., 2021</a>]</cite>. In these works, similarly to our approach, client sampling is considered, but the achieved DP guarantees are at the client-level, which means the participation of a client is indistinguishable from its non-participation. Although client-level DP guarantees are meaningful when the local dataset is composed of the elements from the same source, e.g., personal photos stored in a mobile phone, in some cases, it might be too conservative. To achieve DP guarantees protecting all the elements in a client, a larger amount of noise must be introduced compared to sample-level guarantees, and hence, client-level guarantees result in a larger loss in utility. Moreover, in some cases, the datasets stored by the clients may comprise of samples from different individuals, hence, it may not be necessary to protect client-level privacy. For instance, while learning from medical data, each client may represent a hospital and sample-level DP guarantees would suffice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Malekzadeh et al., 2021</a>]</cite>.</p>

In the analysis carried out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Balle et al., 2020</a>]</cite>, each client is assumed to store only one sample, in which case the client-level guarantees are equivalent to sample-level guarantees. While each client is allowed to store more than one sample in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021a</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021b</a>]</cite>, the number of sampled elements is determined in advance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021b</a>]</cite>, only one element is sampled from the local dataset at each iteration, while more than one but a constant number of elements are sampled in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021a</a>]</cite>. It is also worth noting that different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Balle et al., 2020</a>]</cite> and the current paper, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021a</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021b</a>]</cite>, communication efficiency is studied together with privacy, and a random compression mechanism is used as the randomizer. In all of these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Balle et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021a</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021b</a>]</cite>, the clients are assumed to employ a local randomizer that satisfies pure DP, which we will formally define in <a href="#S2" title="2 Preliminaries ‣ Privacy Amplification via Random Participation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, and the privacy analysis is based on shuffling the local responses. Such an assumption of pure DP for the local randomizers turns out to be useful while jointly analysing client sampling and shuffling. However, if the local randomizers provide approximate DP guarantees instead of pure DP, which is the case when Gaussian noise is used as the randomizer, central privacy guarantees may be substantially degraded. Therefore, novel methods to jointly analyze privacy amplification via client sampling and local dataset sampling that do not rely on shuffling are needed, and this constitutes the main motivation and contribution of our work.</p>

do not deviate from the protocol but they can try to learn about the
local datasets of other clients. We further assume the presence of secure communication channel between each client and the PS such that neither the presence
of communication nor the content of the
transmitted messages is disclosed to third parties. Therefore, in the case of random participation, for an adversary, it is not possible to infer the participating clients by tapping into the channels.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Trusted PS assumption may sound strong, but due to the nature of the client sampling problem, it is essential. Keeping the identities of the participating clients secret from the PS is difficult without employing a trusted third party. Hence, as done in similar works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Balle et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021a</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Girgis et al., 2021b</a>]</cite>, we make this assumption. This assumption is valid for the scenarios in which the training is done with the help of a trusted PS, and the model is publicly deployed after training. If the PS is not trusted, client sampling can still be employed for a price of increased communication cost, and our analysis still holds.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our algorithm, the noise is added by the PS centrally, and the variance of the noise does not depend on any iteration-specific information. Since the number of sampled clients in each iteration can vary, central noise addition makes each client keep track of its own privacy loss much more easier in the FL setting without the need to know the number of sampled clients in each iteration. Central noise addition might be seen as a disadvantage of our scheme since there is no local randomizers at the clients, but in case of a trusted PS, our privacy guarantees are central and this does not constitute a limitation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When the PS is not trusted, client sampling can still be applied, and our theoretical analysis is still valid. In <a href="#alg1" title="In 4.1 Algorithm Description ‣ 4 Main Results ‣ Privacy Amplification via Random Participation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, since Gaussian noise is added by the PS, the same noise protects all the clients’ updates at the same time. In case of an untrusted PS, we cannot rely on the noise addition by the PS; and hence, each client must add Gaussian noise to protect its own privacy. This causes a higher variance of the effective noise added to the total update received by the PS; and hence, reduces the accuracy compared to the trusted PS case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the sampling can still be done in the following manner. First, each client decides to participate or not independently with probability <math id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS5.p2.1.m1.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math>, and if a client decides not to participate, since we do not want the PS to learn if a client is sampled or not, it sends pure noise to the PS without processing its local dataset. If it decides to participate, then it samples its local dataset, calculates the gradients of the sampled elements, and sends the average of the gradients by adding Gaussian noise. This way, the PS will always receive a message from all the available clients, and our analysis on client sampling is still valid. One disadvantage of this modified protocol is that an available client sends a message to the PS at each iteration, even when it is not participating, and hence, the communication efficiency of the scheme degrades, which is one of the main motivations of the client sampling. Note that the reduction in the computational costs due to client sampling is still valid.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">If the communication costs are scarce in a setting, alternatively, we may prefer a client communicates via the PS only if it decides to participate in a round. In this case, the PS would clearly learn if a client is participating or not, and our privacy guarantees reduce to the one provided by WCS.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Client sampling is widely accepted as a core aspect of FL to reduce the energy consumption of clients and to limit the communication load. In this paper, we have analyzed the privacy amplification provided by client sampling in FL to amplify sample-level DP guarantees. While the privacy amplification effect of local data sampling has been well studied, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the approximate DP implications of client sampling in FL. Previous works employing client sampling either provide user-level DP guarantees, or their analyses rely on shuffling. Although shuffling provides strong central privacy guarantees when local randomizers with pure DP guarantees are available, when the local randomizers satisfy approximate DP, the central privacy guarantees degrade considerably. This poses a challenge when Gaussian noise is used as a randomizer in FL settings. Instead, we have provided an analysis that does not rely on shuffling and allows the use of Gaussian noise without degrading the privacy guarantees. We have also shown that when the number of samples available at each client is small, we obtain privacy guarantees close to those of centralized training, in which uniform sampling is possible. Moreover, even if the local dataset sizes are very large, we have shown that client sampling is still quite beneficial compared to only local dataset sampling. Moreover, since available clients locally decide to participate or not, independently from each other and from any other system parameter, they can keep track of their own privacy losses; and therefore, our scheme trivially scales to large systems, and is feasible to apply in practice.</p>
