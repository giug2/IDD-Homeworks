<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed machine learning.
It enables collaborative learning among multiple clients, utilizing distributed data and computing resources. However, FL faces challenges in balancing privacy guarantees, communication efficiency, and overall model accuracy. In this work, we introduce CorBin-FL, a privacy mechanism that uses correlated binary stochastic quantization to achieve differential privacy while maintaining overall model accuracy. The approach uses secure multi-party computation techniques to enable clients to perform correlated quantization of their local model updates without compromising individual privacy.
We provide theoretical analysis showing that CorBin-FL achieves parameter-level local differential privacy (PLDP), and that it asymptotically optimizes the privacy-utility trade-off between the mean square error utility measure and the PLDP privacy measure. We further propose AugCorBin-FL, an extension that, in addition to PLDP, achieves user-level and sample-level central differential privacy guarantees. For both mechanisms, we derive bounds on privacy parameters and mean squared error performance measures.
Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that our mechanisms outperform existing differentially private FL mechanisms, including Gaussian and Laplacian mechanisms, in terms of model accuracy under equal PLDP privacy budgets<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>For reproducibility, our code is included in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available after publication.</span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed stochastic gradient descent in general, and
federated learning (FL) in particular, are foundational concepts in modern machine learning with wide-ranging applications
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The typical FL setup consists of a collection of distributed clients collaborating with a central server over multiple rounds of communication to train a global model.
Each client is equipped with a local dataset. At each communication round, it
receives a copy of the global model and updates it using local data. The updates, usually gradients, are sent to a server, which aggregates them and updates the global model. This enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning among multiple clients, utilizing distributed data and computing resources, without requiring the clients to disclose sensitive data. The latter property is of particular interest in sensitive applications such as training over health datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning inherently provides a degree of privacy by not requiring clients to share raw data. This is further enhanced when combined with secure aggregation techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> which enable the clients to send the aggregate model to the server without revealing
information about local update values.
However, recent works have shown that both the aggregated model updates at each round and the final model weights may leak information about the training data, and even potentially enable the reconstruction of sensitive data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To provide quantifiable guarantees against data leakage, the concept of differential privacy (DP), introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, has emerged as a crucial framework. At a high level, DP requires that the output of an (aggregation) mechanism remains essentially unchanged when any single individual’s data is added to or removed from the input dataset. Several different notions of DP have been considered in FL. User-level central DP (UCDP) requires that the aggregate model at each round does not reveal the participation of any individual client in that round of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Sample-level central DP (SCDP) is more stringent and
requires that the aggregate model does not reveal information about usage of any single training sample <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Parameter-level local DP (PLDP) requires that an eavesdropper gaining access to the local update being transmitted by one of the clients in uplink communication does not gain information about each individual model parameter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Prior works have considered injecting noise into the updates to achieve DP. These include the Gaussian mechanism, Laplacian mechanism, and the Discrete Gaussian mechanism, among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The communication cost of sending the gradients to the server often emerges as a performance bottleneck in FL. This is especially the case in scenarios where the clients are mobile devices with limited uplink bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Recent works have focused on techniques such as gradient quantization to reduce the communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In addition to gains in communication efficiency, quantization may yield improved privacy guarantees.
A stochastic quantization method, called LDP-FL, was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which, in addition to reducing the communication overhead via one-bit quantization of each parameter update, guarantees PLDP. Alternative mechanisms adding discrete noise to quantized updates to achieve DP have also been considered, such as the binomial mechanism in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.14" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider correlated stochastic quantization to achieve various notions of DP, such as UCDP, SCDP, and PLDP. A key feature of our framework is that clients use shared common randomness to coordinate while maintaining privacy. To elaborate, at each communication round, the clients use the public channel facilitated by the server to exchange private keys using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The application of the DH protocol to construct pairwise secure communication among the clients has been previously explored in the literature, for instance the secure aggregation mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. After exchanging private keys, clients are partitioned into pairs, and each pair uses their secure channel to share a few bits of common randomness per model parameter. The shared randomness is used to perform correlated stochastic quantization (Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ III-B Correlated Stochastic Quantization ‣ III Correlated Stochastic Quantizers ‣ CorBin-FL: A Differentially Private Federated Learning Mechanism using Common Randomness" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) of the model parameters, without requiring the clients to share any information about their respective model parameters. The quantizer is designed to achieve PLDP. Furthermore, the quantizer is unbiased and the quantization noises are correlated, such that they cancel each other in the aggregation phase, yielding small mean square error (MSE) between the aggregate of the quantized updates and that of the original local model updates.
We refer to the resulting privacy mechanism, which uses correlated binary stochastic quantization, as the CorBin-FL mechanism. We also introduce the AugCorBin-FL mechanism, in which a fraction of the clients pair up and perform correlated quantization as in CorBin-FL, and the rest of the clients quantize their model weights individually. We show that the AugCorBin-FL mechanism achieves UCDP, SCDP, and PLDP and quantify the corresponding privacy parameters and achievable MSE. The idea of injecting correlated noise to achieve DP, via common randomness shared among pairs of clients, has been studied in two concurrent works, where the Gaussian mechanism was considered in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and general distributed mean estimation scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. A main advantage of CorBin-FL is that it only requires a few bits of common randomness to be shared among the clients per model parameter to achieve close to optimal MSE

This is in contrast with
the aforementioned mechanisms which consider maximal negative correlation among Gaussian variables, that requires an asymptotically large number of common random bits per model parameter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce a novel class of correlated stochastic quantizers.
We first show that the <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_smallcaps">LDPQ</span> quantizer is the solution to a specific privacy-utility optimization. Then, we build on this to construct the maximally correlated distributed quantizers which are used in the CorBin-FL and AugCorBin-FL mechanisms in the subsequent sections.</p>

<p id="S4.SS0.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The CorBin-FL mechanism is robust to client dropouts. The reason is that if a member of a pair of
clients drops out, the quantization performed by the other client is equivalent to the LDPQ quantizer. In fact, if a lower-bound to the dropout probability of each individual client is known, and if the clients dropout independently of each other, then one can derive additional central differential privacy guarantees for the resulting mechanism. This is made precise in the following theorem.</p>

To provide further baselines for comparison, we have implemented the vanilla-FL with no privacy guarantees. An advantage of CorBin-FL and AugCorBin-FL over other mechanisms is the low communication cost due to one-bit quantization of the model parameters. Thus, to provide another baseline, we have implemented the correlated quantization (CQ) method of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> which does not provide piracy guarantees but reduces the communication cost via quantization.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The CorBin-FL and AugCorBin-FL mechanisms were introduced for differentially private federated learning. These approaches, which are based on correlated binary stochastic quantization, were shown to achieve various notions of differential privacy. Theoretical guarantees for privacy parameters and mean squared error were derived. Empirical evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrated improved model accuracy compared to existing methods under equal PLDP privacy budgets. In future works, we will investigate the extension of the proposed methods to correlated quantizers with larger output alphabets, and correlated quantization among collections of more than two clients.</p>
