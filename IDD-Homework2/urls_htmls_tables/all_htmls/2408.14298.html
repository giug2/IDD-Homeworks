<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can provide real-time status and dynamic topology mapping for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, DT and its implementation within industrial IoT networks necessitates substantial, distributed data support, which often leads to “data silos” and raises privacy concerns. To address these issues, we develop a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm tailored for the asynchronous federated learning (FL)-based lightweight DT empowered IoT network. Specifically, our approach aims to minimize a multi-objective function that encompasses both energy consumption and latency by optimizing IoT device selection and transmit power control, subject to FL model performance constraints. We utilize the Lyapunov method to decouple the formulated problem into a series of one-slot optimization problems and develop a two-stage optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal transmission power control and IoT device scheduling strategies. In the first stage, we derive closed-form solutions for optimal transmit power on the IoT device side. In the second stage, since partial state information is unknown, e.g., the transmitting power and computational frequency of IoT device, the edge server employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to model the IoT device selection problem and utilizes an efficient online algorithm, namely the client utility-based upper confidence bound (CU-UCB), to address it. Numerical results validate our algorithm’s superiority over benchmark schemes, and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves faster training speeds on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets within the same training duration.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">WITH the rapid development of industrial Internet of things (IoT) technology, a vast number of IoT devices are being installed in industrial facilities to enable data sensing and monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To enhance resource utilization efficiency in IoT networks and meet quality of service (QoS) standards, there is a need for dynamic and intelligent management of multi-dimensional resources like communication, computation, energy, and storage across the network. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) has been proposed to enhance the ability of managing various resources in the industrial IoT network scenarios from the perspective of the digital world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. DT creates a virtual representation in the digital realm by mapping physical entities with their features, state, and evolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, DT may face challenges in accurately modeling complexity and predicting unforeseen events in real time, which can be addressed through advanced machine learning techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Utilizing machine learning models, DT facilitates intelligent decision-making in dynamic environments efficiently and effectively. For instance, in the industrial manufacturing sector, edge servers with DT can assess the connectivity performance of various industrial devices and proactively allocate communication resources to specific critical devices, thereby improving users’ long-term QoS. Consequently, machine learning-empowered DT provides a pathway to achieve dependable network orchestration in wireless networks by modeling and forecasting the dynamic behavior of IoT networks. However, both DT and central machine learning rely on extensive data support dispersed across IoT devices. The existence of “data silos”, coupled with issues related to privacy and security, makes large-scale data collection impractical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is considered as an efficient solution to address the aforementioned challenges, which is widely applied for building an intelligent model in a cost-efficient and privacy-preserving manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
FL significantly alleviates the burden of DT modeling by distributing model training across diverse IoT devices in parallel. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, FL was integrated with DT to resolve the conflict between model training and privacy protection.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> considers a communication-assisted sensing scenario in DT-empowered mobile networks utilizing FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, Lu <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a new DT wireless network model based on FL and blockchain, enhancing the running efficiency of the model. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduced a new FL framework that integrates DT and proposed cluster-based client selection and DDPG-based resource allocation algorithm to improve performance and reduce delay in dynamic industrial IoT environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the above studies focused on integrating synchronous FL with DT, thereby overlooking the straggler effect in traditional FL, which can result in significant delays. Moreover, most of these studies did not adequately address the dynamic resource scheduling problem when network state information is unknown, often resulting in inefficient FL training.
Although the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to tackle resource scheduling in wireless FL-based DT networks, the limitations of DRL are evident <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
On one hand, DRL’s scalability is weak, as well-trained models often struggle to adapt to environmental changes, such as variations in the number of devices participating in FL training. On the other hand, training DRL models requires substantial computational resources, further complicating the implementation of asynchronous FL and DT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Synchronous FL encounters several issues during implementation. First, all devices usually train their models simultaneously and upload the local models to the server, resulting in high instantaneous concurrent communication overhead. Second, for devices with slower training speeds or unstable network connections, synchronously uploading models for global aggregation poses a significant challenge. Lastly, due to slower training speeds or upload delays caused by network issues, other devices may have to wait for extended periods, leading to resource wastage and reduced training efficiency. To address these issues, a new training mechanism called asynchronous FL has been proposed. Hence, we aim to design efficient dynamic resource scheduling algorithms for lightweight DT-empowered edge networks wireless asynchronous FL. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p>

FL mitigates the risk of privacy exposure for clients by performing local training. Combining DT and FL in IoT networks is an emerging trend in academic research, leveraging FL for data protection and DT for efficient modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> used FL technology to help resource-constrained mobile devices build DTs within wireless networks managed by different mobile network operators.

However, this work focused solely on client scheduling, neglecting comprehensive issues such as communication, computational resources, and energy consumption in wireless asynchronous FL systems. Additionally, it did not optimize client-side resources. Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> emphasized the fairness of client scheduling but overlooked the impact of resource scheduling on the performance of the global model.

It is noted that DT modelling relies on massive data, which cannot be provided by the edge server away from data. Besides, transferring local data from IoT devices to edge servers for constructing DT models can incur substantial communication overhead and pose privacy risks. The introduction of FL into lightweight DT provides an effective solution to the aforementioned issues. The lightweight DT based on FL can enhance both data privacy and modelling efficiency in the co-training of IoT devices, so that the edge server can make intelligent decisions to optimize IoT network orchestration.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, asynchronous FL comprises computational and communication processes. In the computation process, the chosen IoT device trains its local DT model using local datasets, resulting in updated local models. In the communication process, the trained IoT device uploads its local model parameters to the edge server for aggregation. Throughout these processes, IoT devices inevitably incur time and energy expenditures.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In the DT-empowered wireless IoT network, the edge server acts as an aggregator aiming to rapidly acquire aggregated well-trained models. To prevent IoT devices from becoming “stragglers”, we can minimize the time spent by IoT devices to complete global model updates in each communication round, thereby enhancing the training efficiency of asynchronous FL. Furthermore, we also aim to minimize the total energy consumption of all IoT devices for global model updates. Therefore, our main objective for this work is to optimize the transmit power and device selection to minimize latency and energy consumption of asynchronous FL in the IoT network.

Through channel estimation, the channel gain between the IoT devices and the edge server can be obtained by the edge server. However, the CPU frequency of IoT devices is typically variable and unknown, and their transmission power has not yet been determined, presenting a significant challenge for the edge server in making accurate decisions based on this information. In this scenario, a method named MAB can be employed to address the IoT device selection problem in <math id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\mathcal{P}12)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒫</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">12</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2">𝒫</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3">12</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">(\mathcal{P}12)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

However, striking a balance between utilizing past experiences and exploring new strategies for the future has always been a significant challenge in MAB problems.
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a classical MAB algorithm employed to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation for resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Following the explore-exploit strategy, the algorithm selects an arm (or action) at each communication round to minimize the cost. Thus, we design an efficient online learning based IoT devices selection algorithm by extending the classical UCB policy in our system.</p>

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CU-UCB algorithm, we utilize the ResNet-18 model to conduct image classification on 10 classes of images from CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As classic datasets in machine learning, Fashion-MNIST comprises 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, while CIFAR-10 is a color image dataset closely representing everyday objects, consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. We consider three baseline algorithms, i.e., As-Q-only, As-fairness, and Sy-fairness. As-Q-only is an algorithm crafted for dynamic environment, concentrating solely on ensuring queue stability and optimizing the transmission power of IoT devices<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Through multiple simulation experiments, we found that the performance of the As-Q-only method on real-world datasets closely approaches that of the CU-UCB algorithm. This is because the As-Q-only algorithm primarily focuses on ensuring the long-term constraint C1 of asynchronous FL performance. However, the superiority of the CU-UCB algorithm over the As-Q-only method is more evident in terms of energy efficiency and latency, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, in subsequent simulations, we will only present the performance differences between the CU-UCB algorithm and the As-Q-only method concerning energy consumption and latency.</span></span></span>. As-fairness is an algorithm crafted for asynchronous FL settings, prioritizing fairness in the participation of all IoT devices in training, without optimizing transmission power. Sy-fairness is an algorithm designed for synchronous FL settings, focusing solely on ensuring fairness in the participation of all IoT devices in training. Furthermore, in the FL simulation of the real dataset, we have introduced a random selection algorithm that randomly chooses devices to participate in FL training.</p>

It can be observed that CU-UCB scheme achieves a better test accuracy performance than other algorithms. This is because, compared to other algorithms, the CU-UCB algorithm can enhance time utilization efficiency during training by efficiently scheduling resources. However, Sy-fairness algorithm must wait for the slowest IoT device to respond or for a timeout signal before aggregation, which often leads to wastage of wireless resources and computing capabilities of other IoT devices.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm for the asynchronous FL-based lightweight DT-empowered IoT network. Specifically, we aimed to minimize a multi-objective
function, capturing both the energy consumption and latency, by optimizing IoT device selection and transmit power control under an FL model performance constraint. Then, we utilized the Lyapunov method to decouple the formulated problem into a series of one-slot optimization problems. We optimized the transmit power for the chosen IoT device, achieving closed-form solutions using the LambertW function and convex optimization. Additionally, we proposed an online learning algorithm named CU-UCB for IoT device selection, which achieved sub-linear regret performance over communication rounds. Numerical results demonstrated the superiority of our algorithms compared to benchmark schemes. The simulation results also indicated that our CU-UCB algorithm achieved a faster training speed compared to the other baseline algorithms on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset under the same training duration.</p>
