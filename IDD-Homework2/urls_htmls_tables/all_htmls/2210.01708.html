<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (<em id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients.
Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence.
However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters.
In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed.
Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily-available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden?
To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> has become increasingly prevalent in the research community, having the goal of enabling collaborative training with a network of clients without needing to share any private data.
One key challenge for this training paradigm is overcoming data heterogeneity.
The participating devices in a federated system are often deployed across a variety of users and environments, resulting in a non-IID data distribution. As the level of heterogeneity intensifies, optimization becomes increasingly difficult.
Various techniques have been proposed for alleviating this issue. These primarily consist of modifications to the local or global objectives through proximal terms, regularization, and improved aggregation operations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
More recently, some works have investigated the role of model initialization in mitigating such effects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Inspired by the common usage of pre-trained models for facilitating strong transfer learning in centralized training, researchers employed widely-available pre-trained weights for initialization in FL and were able to close much of the gap between federated and centralized performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Still, while pre-trained initializations are effective for alleviating heterogeneity effects in FL, another key challenge is left unaddressed; that is, communication constraints. This is often the primary bottleneck for real-world federated systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In the standard FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>,
updates for all model parameters are sent back and forth between the server and participating clients each round. This can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models beyond very small MLPs are used.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When employing strong pre-trained models, the number of parameters can be large, such as for current state-of-the-art transformers. For example, ViT-Base (ViT-B) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has 84 million parameters, which would simply exacerbate the communication overhead to insurmountable levels. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">As a compromise, most existing FL work focuses on the performance of smaller Convolutional Neural Networks (<em id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>) on smaller datasets (<em id="S1.p3.1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, EMINIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>). Considering the thriving progress in large pre-trained Foundation Models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, <span id="S1.p3.1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">an efficient framework enabling these large pre-trained models will be significant for the FL community.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the previous study on centralized training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, we note that pre-trained models have strong representations, and updating all the weights during fine-tuning is often not necessary. Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (<em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, fine-tuning only a subset of the parameters or the bias terms) for centralized training have been proposed in the literature and show that successful and efficient adaptation is possible, even under domain shift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
We reason that such insight is applicable to FL, where each client can be thought of as a shifted domain on which we are fine-tuning.
By leveraging pre-trained weights, it may be possible to simply update a small portion of the weights for each client.
This will significantly reduce the communication burden on the system, as the updates communicated with the server will consist of just a fraction of the total model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Can we reap these potential communication benefits while still achieving strong performance in FL?
Unfortunately, operating conditions in FL are difficult, requiring successful convergence under varying data heterogeneity levels, random client availability, and differential privacy procedures.
Therefore, we are unable to properly assess this possibility of benefit based on existing literature, as <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has not been explored in such situations in FL.</span>
To fill this gap, we explore the viability of a Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) framework <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">with a systemic empirical study on a comprehensive set of FL scenarios</span>. The framework is illustrated in <a href="#S0.F1" title="In Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We deploy parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt pre-trained models and enable massive reductions in communication overheads.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning.</span> Federated learning is a decentralized training paradigm composed of two procedures: local training and global aggregation. Therefore, most existing work focuses on either local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> to learn a better global model.
Another line of work cuts into this problem by applying different initialization to help both procedures. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> show that initializing the model with pre-trained weights can make the global aggregation of FedAvg more stable, even when pre-trained with synthetic data. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> present the effectiveness of pre-training with different local and global operations. However, these works focus purely on the effect of initialization in a standard FedAvg framework and do not consider the communication constraints of the system. Our work pushes the envelope further by leveraging strong pre-trained models (even large, capable transformers) in federated learning while effectively handling the communication issue via parameter-efficient fine-tuning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Communication in Federated Learning.</span> Communication constraints are a primary bottleneck in federated learning. To reduce the communication cost, several previous work leverage model compression techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Such works do not change the training paradigm but rather post-processes the local model to reduce communication costs. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> propose approaches that parameterize the model with fewer variables and compress the model in an encoding-decoding fashion. However, the minimal requirement to maintain all the information is still high when facing today’s large models. Meanwhile, another line of work changes the training paradigm by learning federated ensembles based on several pre-trained base models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In this way, only the mixing weights of the base models will be communicated in each round. This approach aims to reduce the burden of downloading and uploading the entire model in each round.
However, the base models are not directly trained, and the final performance is highly related to the base models. Meanwhile, model ensembles will take more time and space, which is often limited on the client side. Our framework follows the strategy of this line of work that does not transmit the entire model, but we use only one pre-trained model instead of several base models and only transmit a subset of the parameters instead of the model ensembles. Therefore, no additional time or space is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning.</span> Fine-tuning is a prevalent topic in centralized transfer learning, especially in this era of the “Foundation Model” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. A significant line of work is to reduce the trainable parameter number, <em id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This enables easier access and usage of pre-trained models by reducing the memory cost needed to conduct fine-tuning due to fewer computed gradients.
In federated learning, PEFT has an additional benefit that is not salient in centralized training: reduction of the communication cost. By introducing PEFT to federated learning, our work can take advantage of a strong (and even large) pre-trained model meanwhile significantly reducing communication costs. Our framework is the first work to present a comprehensive study of PEFT in various FL settings.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional federated learning, updates for the entire model need to be repeatedly sent to and from the server, resulting in significant communication costs, especially when larger, more capable modern neural network architectures are employed.
To reduce this heavy burden, we deploy parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt pre-trained models to the local clients rather than fully fine-tuning all parameters, which is described in <a href="#alg1" title="In 3.1 Recap: Conventional FL with FedAvg ‣ 3 Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning ‣ Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
In the FedPEFT framework, illustrated in <a href="#S0.F1" title="In Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, only a small amount of parameters in the local model will be downloaded, trained, and uploaded in each communication round. For instance, FedPEFT reduces the size of communication each round from 328MB/Client to 0.68MB/Client when using a pre-trained ViT-Base as the backbone.</p>

This method is historically the most common fine-tuning procedure, and therefore we use it as a baseline for FedPEFT.
However, the adaptation ability of this method is limited, as no adjustment is made to the network representation prior to the final output head. This can be problematic in the presence of a more intense domain shift.
Therefore, we consider the following approaches as primary prototypes for FedPEFT:</p>

Interestingly, full fine-tuning falls further behind as the data domain gap widens in the PCam scenario, largely unable to keep up with FedPEFT despite requiring a massive communication budget. This phenomenon when a pre-trained model meets out-of-domain data has been studied under centralized settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. It was found that the pre-trained upstream representations are still meaningful even with a domain gap. Therefore, fully fine-tuning the backbone with out-of-domain data can damage the high-level semantics inside these upstream representations due to overfitting, especially when the data size is small. This is particularly relevant in FL, where overfitting and subsequent client drift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> are prone to occur.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the opposite end of the spectrum, by not fine-tuning the backbone at all, head-tuning maintains similar accuracy despite the domain gap.
This shows the robustness of the pre-trained high-level semantics across domains, supporting the conclusion that <span id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">there is meaningful high-level semantics inside of the upstream representations</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Still, the tight restriction on head-tuning is perhaps a bit too far, as the accuracy on both datasets is still low overall. Between the two extremes of head-tuning and full fine-tuning, FedPEFT approaches may be able to suitably adapt the upstream representations without excessively damaging them.
Specifically, FedPEFT-Bias operates with parameter-level control for each parameter pair containing weight and bias terms. The representation can then preserve the high-level semantics by freezing the weight term (maintaining the direction in the feature space) and still adapting via the bias term (shifting in the feature space). FedPEFT-Adapter and FedPEFT-Prompt have slightly different mechanisms (layer-level), controlling the backbone by transforming the intermediate hidden representations via adapters and prompts. However, the capability to handle the domain gap of FedPEFT-Prompt is stronger than FedPEFT-Adapter. Of these approaches, FedPEFT-Prompt is the most stable under the domain gap, surpassing full fine-tuning by  1.1% on PCam.
Overall, we hypothesize that <span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">more fine-tuning freedom will be better when the domain gap is minor, but moderate fine-tuning is needed to maintain, as well as control, the high-level semantics when the domain gap is large</span>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In application scenarios, the setting of federated learning can vary substantially. It is important to show the capability to maintain high performance in diverse settings. In <a href="#S6.T2" title="In 6.1 Capability with Domain Gap ‣ 6 Capability Analysis ‣ Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we present results for all approaches with different client availability ratios and data distributions and draw the following conclusions from the experiments:</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, we see that fine-tuning the pre-trained model shows a significant improvement over training from scratch, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. This finding is in agreement with other very recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which note the stabilization effect of pre-trained initialization in federated optimization.
When only fine-tuning the head, the performance is still much better than training the entire model from scratch (Scratch) but remains low in comparison to other methods across all settings. We again find that head-tuning simply lacks adaptation ability, holding too closely to the upstream representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, we find that FedPEFT achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning with
less than 0.3% of the trainable parameters. This ability to maintain accuracy performance in various scenarios is crucial for FL, as oftentimes, the exact setting and distributions are not known ahead of time.
With this in mind, we further investigate the viability of FedPEFT as a practical FL framework in some more extreme situations in <a href="#S7" title="7 Robustness Analysis ‣ Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Differential Privacy.</span>
A fundamental property of federated learning is privacy protection. However, various works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have demonstrated how the client data can be reconstructed from the raw gradient updates received by the server in some scenarios. To protect client data privacy from such attacks, differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has become standard practice.
Therefore, we first study FedPEFT and other baselines under DP.</p>

Interestingly, when comparing all methods, full fine-tuning experiences the sharpest drop with DP. This causes its accuracy to fall lower than all the FedPEFT prototypes. To understand this effect, we note that DP applies noise to all trainable parameter gradients. Full fine-tuning, therefore, requires such noise on all model parameters, resulting in a more pronounced negative effect on final performance. On the other hand, the other fine-tuning methods maintain some part of the backbone frozen and have significantly fewer trainable parameters on which adding noise is necessary, limiting the performance drop.
Overall, FedPEFT allows for stronger accuracy in DP-enabled federated systems than even full fine-tuning while still maintaining extremely low communication needs.

We explore another common yet challenging robustness condition in FL; that is when very little data is available on individual clients.
Such data scarcity scenarios are even a tricky problem in centralized training. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> show that fewer training data will incur damage to the pre-trained representation due to overfitting.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the experiments above, we maintain a consistent backbone (ViT-B). However, since model size requirements of different federated systems may vary, we further investigate the use of ViT-S with FedPEFT and all baselines. Additionally, we study the effect of pre-training dataset size and paradigm on the final performance of all approaches. CIFAR-100 is used for the experiments, and the results are presented in <a href="#S7.T5" title="In 7 Robustness Analysis ‣ Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

As expected, most methods experience a slight performance drop. Nonetheless, FedPEFT methods maintain strong performance even with smaller models.
Surprisingly, the performance of head-tuning is not damaged by reducing the model size but actually increases slightly.
We interpret it as due to the fixed representation of head-tuning. Representations from a pre-trained model can have similar semantics whatever the model size, thus the performance of head-tuning is stable.

<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of Pre-training Dataset.</span> We also evaluate the performance when a backbone is trained from ImageNet-21K and ImageNet-1K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Interestingly, the performance stays relatively consistent, with Head-tuning and FedPEFT-Adapter achieving higher accuracy with the ImageNet-1K models.
This phenomenon indicates that the performance of fine-tuning is not always proportional to the data size, but overall FedPEFT performance is consistent with different scales of the pre-training dataset.

FedPEFT still achieves comparable results with full fine-tuning and outperforms Head-tuning, showing the robustness of FedPEFT.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce FedPEFT, a new federated learning framework leveraging strong pre-trained models and massively reducing communication costs.
We integrate three effective prototypes within the FedPEFT framework: Bias, Adapter, and Prompt.
With a thorough empirical study, we then evaluate FedFEFT and other baselines in three key areas: communication, capability, and robustness. We find FedPEFT to be a promising approach for practical FL systems, capable of handling many of the harsh conditions in FL while alleviating the critical communication bottleneck.
As a general framework, FedPEFT can also be leveraged in application domains other than computer vision, which we leave for future work.
We hope this work can inspire new perspectives in federated learning through the combined innovation of strong pre-trained models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methodologies.

As expected, when the domain gap is smaller, <em id="A3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="A3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, Resisc45, the performance of Full Fine-tuning is slightly better than FedPEFT, benefiting from the highest level of fine-tuning. Meanwhile, in the presence of more domain gaps with PCam, pre-trained representations are problematic for the target domain, leading to a performance lower than training from scratch for Head-tuning. Therefore, fine-tuning beyond the head is necessary and helpful when facing domain gaps. The performance of Full Fine-tuning and FedPEFT is better than Head-tuning in such cases, especially with more participating clients. Among these two fine-tuning strategies, FedPEFT outperforms full fine-tuning in almost all FL settings when facing out-of-domain data, showing the robustness of FedPEFT and the potential to be applied to various FL scenarios.</p>

<p id="A5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the era of the “Foundation Model” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, large pre-trained models are widely used in many other fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, those large models have not been studied in federated learning scenarios due to the large communication burden. Our work aims to address the communication challenge to enable those large models to be considered for federated learning with low communication costs. Furthermore, our work also makes it possible to deploy FL in underdeveloped regions where the communication situation is not ideal. Meanwhile, our work focuses on the training paradigm in FL, which is distinct from other communication reduction methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, and can be deployed together in practice.</p>
