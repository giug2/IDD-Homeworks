<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">To leverage massive distributed data and computation resources, machine learning in the network edge is considered to be a promising technique especially for large-scale model training.
Federated learning (FL), as a paradigm of collaborative learning techniques, has obtained increasing research attention with the benefits of communication efficiency and improved data privacy.
Due to the lossy communication channels and limited communication resources (e.g., bandwidth and power), it is of interest to investigate fast responding and accurate FL schemes over wireless systems.
Hence, we investigate the problem of jointly optimized communication efficiency and resources for FL over wireless <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> Internet of things (IoT)</span> networks.
To reduce complexity, we divide the overall optimization problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the client scheduling problem and the resource allocation problem.
To reduce the communication costs for FL in wireless <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">IoT</span> networks, a new client scheduling policy is proposed by reusing stale local model parameters.
To maximize successful information exchange over networks,
a Lagrange multiplier method is first leveraged by decoupling variables including power variables, bandwidth variables and transmission indicators.
Then a linear-search based power and bandwidth allocation method is developed.
Given appropriate hyper-parameters, we show that the proposed communication-efficient federated learning (CEFL) framework converges at a strong linear rate.
Through extensive experiments, it is revealed that the proposed CEFL framework substantially boosts both the communication efficiency and learning performance of both training loss and test accuracy for FL over wireless <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">IoT</span> networks compared to a basic FL approach with uniform resource allocation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of various emerging smart applications (e.g, augmented reality/virtual reality, autonomous driving and digital twin), the number of Internet of things (IoT) devices has increased explosively and the massive data generated from these connected IoT devices have led to a surging demand for very high communication rates in future wireless communications, such as the projected sixth generation (6G) mobile networks.
It is envisioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> that by 2025, the active number of IoT devices is expected to be over 75 billion.
The massive amounts of data can bring diverse intelligent services due to the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large-scale machine learning (ML).
However, the data originating from massive IoT devices are commonly generated and stored in a distributed manner over wireless networks for a wide range of networked AI applications, e.g., smart grids<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, remote health monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, etc.
Due to the nature of limited wireless communication resources as well as privacy concerns, it is often inefficient or impractical to directly collect all raw data of devices at a central entity (e.g., the cloud).
Alternatively, it is increasingly attractive to process data directly in edge clients for data analysis and inference by leveraging edge computing and intelligence with data kept locally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the regime of distributed machine learning, federated learning (FL), first coined by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,
is a paradigm of distributed ML, which pushes the computation of AI applications into edge clients.
Therefore, FL decouples the ability of ML from the need to reveal the data to a centralized location, which helps mitigate privacy and latency concerns.
During the training process of FL, in which edge clients seek to train a common ML model, each client periodically transmits its locally derived model parameters to a central parameter server (PS). A set of global model parameters are updated in the PS according to aggregation strategies such as federated averaging algorithm (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>) [3], and the PS then sends its updated global model parameters to clients for their local model updates.
Compared with the traditional data-sharing based collaborative learning, both communication efficiency and user data privacy are significantly improved in FL.
Since the ML parameters are frequently exchanged between the PS and the edge clients over a wireless network, the performance of FL is largely constrained by the properties of wireless communication networks, which can be unstable and may even fluctuate significantly over time because of the limited wireless resources (e.g., bandwidth) and unreliable wireless channels.
Thus, this calls for a new design principle for FL
from both learning and wireless communication perspectives.

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the proposal of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, there has been an increasing number of studies related to the implementation of FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> report on a system design of FL algorithms in the domain of Android mobile phones and sketch the challenges and corresponding solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advantages of FL in terms of communication overheads and user data privacy over the traditional data-sharing based collaborative learning, the implementation of FL over wireless networks still suffers from bottlenecks.
More specifically, since multiple communication rounds are required to reach a desired ML accuracy, especially when the number of participating clients is comparably large, the communication costs incurred by unreliable wireless transmission become non-negligible in wireless FL systems.
To reduce communication overhead in distributed ML, various learning algorithms have been proposed in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Among these efforts, one research direction is to reduce the communication footprint in the uploading phase to make the model training communication efficient.
Typical approaches in this direction range from i) compressing the uploaded gradients via coding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, ii) limiting the model sharing by only updating clients with significant training improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, or iii) accelerating the training process by adopting a momentum method in the sparse update <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
More specifically, a lazily aggregated gradient approach is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to skip unnecessary uploads, among which communication censoring schemes are developed to avoid less informative local updates so as to reduce the communication burden.
It is also worth mentioning that the impact of network resources on the learning performance is not considered in any of those methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to communication overhead, another series of work have focused on resource allocation in order to optimize the FL learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
To improve wireless network efficiency, considerable research has been carried out and two main research directions play crucial roles including admission control and device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and resource scheduling management (e.g., spectrum and power) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a new FedCS protocol is proposed to schedule as many devices as possible in a limited time frame.
Another device scheduling policy is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, among which the channel conditions and the significance of the local model updates are jointly considered.
Nonetheless, these proposed policies are only evaluated via experiments and the convergence performance has not been theoretically analyzed.
To characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks, an analytical model with regard to the FL convergence rate has been developed and the impacts have been evaluated by three different client scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling, round-robin, and proportional fair <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
By building a connection between the wireless resource allocation and the FL learning performance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose to optimize the user selection and power allocation to minimize the FL training loss.
Despite of all these results, the existing methods often still involve high overhead both in computation and communication, especially for large-scale ML.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve fast learning, the FL training process typically schedules as many clients as possible at each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
However, it is undesirable for all clients engaged in learning to transmit their fresh local FL models to the PS
especially when the updates are conveyed over a wireless medium with limited resources (e.g., transmit power and network bandwidth).
Having more clients scheduled and uploading local models simultaneously can result in large overheads in communication, more unstable connections, and higher latency,
which inevitably lead to learning task with less accuracy.
To this end, we aim for an optimal solution of joint client scheduling and their associated resource allocation scheme in each communication round to pursue the best learning performance.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">(P-0) is a non-convex optimization problem due to the nonconvexity of its objective function and constraint (<a href="#S2.E7.3" title="In 7 ‣ II-D Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7c</span></a>).
To solve problem (P-0), we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., i) determining the client scheduling policy at each communication round, and ii) deciding the optimal resource allocation scheme for the clients that have been selected from sub-problem i).
We refer to the first subproblem as the <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client scheduling</span> problem and the second subproblem as the <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource allocation</span> problem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of integrated circuits, local computation time can be several orders of magnitude shorter than communication time between the clients and PS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
The vanilla FL framework can lead to large communication overheads (e.g., communication time) and it can be inefficient to sequentially update the trained models from all clients before global aggregating and averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Accordingly, a subgroup of clients can be actively selected to transmit their local FL models simultaneously.
Then the communication efficiency can be improved and the communication latency can be reduced.
To this end, client scheduling policy plays a crucial role in FL process especially
when wireless resources are limited with.
With the goal of reducing communication overheads per communication round, a communication-efficient client selection policy will be developed below.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of the proposed CEFL approach for classification on MNIST dataset is evaluated in Fig. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a> by training a CNN model over cumulative communication overhead.
We first report the results for i.i.d. data partition case.
The corresponding experimental results about the training loss, test accuracy, and the utilization of clients are shown in Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(b), and Fig. 2(c), respectively.
It is observed that under the same total communication overhead, the proposed CEFL approach performs better than the vanilla FL method (<span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>).
This is because that less informative messages (i.e., local FL models) from clients are restricted to upload to the PS in CEFL approach whilst all messages are transmitted to the PS for updating in <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> method at each communication round.
We use an intuitive explanation as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>(c) to showcase the effectiveness of CEFL on selectively uploaded local models.
In Fig. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>(c), one blue stick refers to the percentage of participated clients to upload local models at each communication round.
In the initial several communication rounds, communication events happen sparsely. While during the late communication rounds (150-th to 200-th), almost all messages (i.e., local FL models) from clients are critical and selected to transmit in our proposed policy, implying that client scheduling policy works better at the first half communication rounds.
Similar performance results have also been observed in Fig. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>(d)-Fig. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Simulation Setup ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>(f), where non-i.i.d. case on the MNIST training dataset is taken into account.
It is worth noting that compared with that of i.i.d. case, the percentage of participated clients is much higher in non-i.i.d. case.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Simulation Results ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning over Wireless IoT Networks with Optimized Communication and Resources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a>(a), we first show how resource allocation scheme affects the convergence behavior of the global FL model training in terms of the value of the training loss.
As the communication cost increases, the training losses of the considered algorithms decrease at different rates, whilst the proposed CEFL framework consisting of the new client scheduling policy and the LS based resource allocation (denoted as ’CEFL-Opt’) achieves the lowest loss.

This is reasonable since both client selection and resource allocation are taken into account in the proposed CEFL framework so as to reduce the effect of wireless transmission errors in FL.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have studied the joint optimization problem of communication and resources with federated learning over wireless <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">IoT</span> networks, in which both client selection and resource allocation are considered.
A CEFL framework was proposed combined with a new client scheduling policy and an LS based allocation method, respectively.
We showed that the presented LS approach was able to provide an optimal solution for bandwidth and power allocation and the convergence and communication properties of the proposed CEFL algorithm were also theoretically analyzed.
Extensive experimental results revealed that the proposed CEFL algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline method both in communication overheads and learning performance under different data distributions.
Besides, the proposed CEFL framework can effectively schedule clients according to both the learned model parameter characteristics and wireless channel dynamics.
