<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">As a promising method of central model training on decentralized device data while securing user privacy, Federated Learning (FL) is becoming popular in Internet of Things (IoT) design.
However, when the data collected by IoT devices are highly skewed in a non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) manner, the accuracy of vanilla FL method cannot be guaranteed.
Although there exist various solutions that try to address the bottleneck of FL with non-IID data, most of them suffer from extra intolerable communication overhead and low model accuracy.
To enable fast and accurate FL, this paper proposes a novel data-based device grouping approach that can effectively reduce the disadvantages of weight divergence during the training of non-IID data.
However, since our grouping method is based on the similarity of extracted feature maps from IoT devices, it may incur additional risks of privacy exposure.
To solve this problem, we propose an improved version by exploiting similarity information using the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm without exposing extracted feature maps.
Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that our approach can not only accelerate the convergence rate, but also improve the prediction accuracy for FL with non-IID data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Along with the prosperity of 5G techniques, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing,
Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is becoming a popular distributed machine learning paradigm for the design of cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as commercial surveillance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, industrial control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Rather than bring data to the centralized model, FL dispatches models to data sources (i.e., IoT devices) to assist the model training.
In FL, the cloud manages a global model for the fusion of local models hosted by IoT devices.
During the training process, devices only send their gradients to the cloud server for weight aggregation, thus the data privacy protection and low communication overhead can be achieved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL is promising in enabling collaborative learning among IoT devices, it greatly suffers from the problems caused by data distribution diversity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
When dealing with independent and identically distributed (IID) data, vanilla FL shows excellent performance, since all the stochastic gradients obtained from local data are unbiased estimates of the full gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, when dealing with non-IID, the convergence directions of local models during the training phase are highly inconsistent.
Due to the weight divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the accuracy of vanilla FL may be greatly reduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, non-IID FL requires much more communication rounds than IID FL to achieve the global model convergence, which in turn poses intolerable pressure on the limited network bandwidth of IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to improve the accuracy of non-IID FL, various model optimization techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and model comparison methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have been proposed to mitigate the weight divergence problem.
However, most non-IID FL methods have their own innegligible side-effects, since they will result in significant communication overhead.
Moreover, the exposure of local models to the cloud for comparison may easily violate the FL privacy requirement.
All these issues hinder the wide deployment of FL techniques on non-IID IoT applications.
As a result, how to design a fast and accurate non-IID FL without exposing model privacy information is becoming a major bottleneck in IoT design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenge, this paper presents a novel device grouping-based FL method named FLDG that can effectively reduce the disadvantages of weight divergence during the training of non-IID data.
Unlike vanilla FL that randomly selects IoT devices for model gradient aggregation, our proposed non-IID FL method clusters devices based on the similarities of their raw data and selects only one device from a group for the model gradient aggregation.
In this way, our approach can stabilize the convergence of the global model, since all kinds of model divergences are involved once in each FL training round without unpredictable perturbations caused by random device selection.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has lower communication overhead than other distributed machine learning methods, it suffers from the diversity of data distributions on IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, especially for non-IID scenarios.
To address this problem, various strategies have been investigated.
For example, Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> dispatched public data and pre-trained model based on the public data to all the devices, and formed a system that only consists of 10 clients in total.
Nonetheless, the settings they used are unrealistic, since practical FL would typically involve plenty of clients and much more complex data distributions.
Based on reinforcement learning, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduced an effective FL method, which selects devices with the highest rewards to participate in each round of interactions.
However, their approach requires Principle Component Analysis (PCA)- compressed model weights of all the devices to construct the state space for training reinforcement learning strategies, which introduces a large amount of additional communication and computation overhead, thus making its deployment on IoT devices incapable.
Aiming at improving the performance of FL in non-IID scenarios, device grouping methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have been studied to address the problem of weight divergence.
For example, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and Briggs et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> replaced the unique global model with multiple global models according to the similarity of local models.
However, these approaches weaken the generalization capability of FL, i.e., IoT devices from different groups cannot learn from each other effectively.
Based on the K-center method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> presented a baseline method that groups devices based on the similarity of local models.
Their approach selects one representative device from each group for local model aggregation in each round.
Since the method is based on the model comparison every 10 rounds, it may easily cause the intolerable communication overhead.
Meanwhile, model exposure may result in serious data privacy leak problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issues of data privacy in FL-based scenarios, various protection mechanisms have been proposed.
Typically, they can be classified into two categories, i.e., data-based privacy protection and feature map-based privacy protection.
For example, as a kind of data-based privacy protection, Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> presented a privacy-preserving protocol to support the secure aggregation in FL by exploiting secure multiparty computation.
Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> designed a blockchain empowered secure data sharing architecture and shared the data model rather than revealing the actual data to maintain the privacy of data.
For the feature map-based privacy protection, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> provided privacy assurance for multiparty deep learning with the homomorphic encryption scheme.
Although the above approaches are promising in protecting data privacy, they do not consider the similarity of data distribution among IoT devices.
Moreover, most of them introduce significant memory usage and computation costs.
Therefore, it is hard to directly apply them on IoT applications, which are resource-constrained.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has been widely used as a distributed machine learning approach in IoT design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,
most FL methods focus on adversarial attack issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> rather than the performance in non-IID scenarios.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt that utilizes the
data-based device grouping and LSH algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to enable a fast and accurate FL for non-IID scenarios without exposing data privacy.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although vanilla FL (i.e., FedAvg) has shown its excellent performance on collaborative learning with IID data, it cannot be directly applied to IoT scenarios.
This is because the data distributed on IoT devices is mostly non-IID due to various factors such as user preferences and device locations.
When dealing with non-IID scenarios, the performance of vanilla FL degrades dramatically.

As an example, for CIFAR-10 benchmark <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, FedAvg converges within around 300 rounds for the IID scenario, and the accuracy can reach 57.37%.</p>

Moreover, Case 1 of the non-IID FL model is still far from convergence at round 300.
We can observe a similar trend for the Fashion-MNIST and the MNIST benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
The trends of low accuracy and slow convergence rate for non-IID scenarios are mainly due to the weight divergence of device models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> during FL training.
For IID scenarios, gradient optimization directions of IoT devices are similar due to the same device data distributions.
However, for non-IID scenarios, due to the random device selection and highly skewed device data distributions, the optimization directions of IoT devices in each FL round vary significantly.
This will strongly affect the optimization direction of the global model which is generated based on the federated averaging operation on local models.
Since it is hard to find a global model that is optimized for all the IoT devices in non-IID scenarios, the model accuracy for non-IID scenarios is worse than the one for the IID scenario.
Moreover, the variable optimization directions of local models result in unstable optimization direction of the global model, thus slowing down the convergence rate.
In other words, more communication rounds are required between the cloud and IoT devices during the FL training, which is a waste of training time and network bandwidth.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we assume that IoT devices scattered in different places have non-IID data.
Therefore, we propose a novel Federated Learning with Device Grouping (FLDG) method to enable efficient FL for non-IID scenarios.
Our FLDG approach divides the FL process into two phases:
i) the preprocessing phase, which groups all the IoT devices based on the similarity of extracted feature maps from raw device data;
and ii) the training phase, which iteratively trains the shared global model by aggregating the gradient information sent by randomly selected devices from the groups obtained in preprocessing phase.
Note that our approach groups IoT devices based on the extracted feature maps from raw device data rather than device models, which requires much less comparison efforts and communication cost.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A An Overview of Our Grouping-based FL ‣ IV Our Grouping-Based FL Approaches ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates the workflows of our proposed FL methods, i.e., FLDG and FLDG-L, which are based on device grouping.
Note that the workflow of FLDG-L is almost the same as that of FLDG.
The only difference is that FLDG clusters IoT devices based on feature maps while FLDG-L clusters IoT devices based on the LSH values of feature maps, thus the data privacy during the preprocessing phase can be further secured by using FLDG-L.
Without taking the step shown in the red dashed box into account, Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-A An Overview of Our Grouping-based FL ‣ IV Our Grouping-Based FL Approaches ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a> shows the preprocessing workflow for FLDG.
Otherwise, the step shown in the red dashed box encodes the feature maps with the p-stable LSH functions, which makes the restore from LSH values to raw device data much more difficult.
The details of the feature hashing using p-stable LSH functions will be introduced in the next
section.
Note that for both FLDG and FLDG-L, the preprocessing phase only needs to be conducted once to train a new global model if the distributions of device data keep unchanged.
Therefore, the device grouping results remain unchanged throughout the whole training process after the preprocessing.
Since the complexity of LSH and the K-Means algorithm is O(n), the overhead caused by both operations in preprocessing phase is much smaller than the overall workload of the entire FL framework.
Unlike vanilla FL that randomly selects IoT devices, both FLDG and FLDG-L only randomly select one IoT device from each group for the aggregation.

</h3>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our grouping-based FL, the preprocessing phase mainly deals with device grouping.
It consists of three steps, i.e., data generation, feature extraction, and device clustering.
For the data generation step, IoT devices collect their labeled non-IID data samples and save them in memory for the device grouping and local model training.
However, due to the large volume of collected data samples, it is not economical
to directly conduct device clustering based on the similarity of these raw data.
Moreover, comparing raw data at the pixel level may be infeasible.
This is because, for the samples of the same category, they may have totally different representations.
Due to the lack of semantic information, comparing samples pixel by pixel may easily lead to incorrect device clustering results.
As an alternative, our approach conducts the device grouping based on the feature maps of raw device data, which can be extracted by some pre-trained model from libraries like Keras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and Torchvision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
By using feature maps, the characteristics of raw data on an IoT device can be effectively and accurately expressed while the size of comparison objects can be remarkably reduced.</p>

To reduce the communication overhead, vanilla FL
does not take all the IoT devices in one FL training round.
Instead, only a subset of IoT devices is randomly selected for the gradient aggregation.
As aforementioned, this will cause the optimization direction divergence of the global model, since model optimization directions in different devices are usually different in non-IID scenarios.
However, devices in the same group usually have similar model optimization directions.
To improve the performance of FL in non-IID scenarios, our approach randomly selects one IoT device from each group during each round of model training.
In this way, we can make the optimization direction of the global model in each round consistent with its final optimization direction, thus accelerating the model convergence rate of non-IID FL training.
Note that the more groups we clustered in the preprocessing phase, the more IoT devices will be selected in the training phase to participate in the gradient aggregation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.6" class="ltx_p">In FLDG, our approach groups IoT devices based on the similarity between extracted feature maps.
Therefore, all the selected devices should send their averaged feature maps to the cloud, which may lead to high risk of privacy exposure.
For example, by using model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> or membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, raw data can be restored from the feature maps, resulting serious privacy leaking problems.
To address this problem, we propose an improved version of FLDG named FLDG-L, which
encodes feature maps based on the hash functions from the p-stable LSH family <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

In FLDG-L, selected devices only send the hash values of averaged feature maps to the cloud, thus the risk of privacy exposure can be greatly reduced.
The following subsections will introduce the implementation details of FLDG-L and analyze its capability of privacy protection.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection"><span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.4.1.1" class="ltx_text">IV-C</span>1 </span>Implementation of FLDG-L</h4>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FLDG-L adopts the similar workflow as FLDG as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A An Overview of Our Grouping-based FL ‣ IV Our Grouping-Based FL Approaches ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
The only difference is that FLDG-L adds a step of extracted feature map hashing before the device grouping in the cloud as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-A An Overview of Our Grouping-based FL ‣ IV Our Grouping-Based FL Approaches ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>.
Since the FLDG-L training procedures for the global model and local device models
are the same as the one of FLGD, we omit the introduction to these parts in this subsection.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">According to the properties of traditional hash functions, for a given hash value, it is extremely hard to restore its original data even if the hash function is known.
Therefore, by using hash values of feature maps, the data privacy of IoT devices can be guaranteed.
Moreover, based on the properties of p-stable LSH family in definition 1, the hash values still partially keep the data characteristics (e.g., distributions) of the original data. Moreover, although the size of hash values is much smaller than original data, they still contain enough information to enable
the similarity comparison. Therefore, by using p-stable LSH functions, the data privacy and the similarity comparison accuracy can be simultaneously guaranteed.
Meanwhile, due to the small-size of hash values, the network communication overhead will be drastically reduced between the cloud and IoT devices.
Note that when the output dimension of a p-stable LSH family is small, it is difficult to form a sufficient number of groups, which may reduce the inference
performance of FL.
However, if more p-stable LSH functions are used in FLDG-L, the computation and communication overhead will become larger.
Therefore, there should be a trade-off between model accuracy and the output dimension of p-stable LSH functions.</p>

We conducted three experiments on benchmarks MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, respectively, and constructed corresponding FL models as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> using PyTorch (version 1.3.1).
For each convolution layer (i.e., <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Conv2D</span>), we provide the information of input and output dimensions, kernel size, stride and padding.
For the fully connected layer (i.e., <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FC</span>), we provide the information about input and output dimensions.
For the dropout layer (i.e., <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DropOut</span>), we provide the probability of an element to be zeroed.
To enable device grouping, we used the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from Keras (version 2.3.1) to extract feature maps (with a size of <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1280\times 1" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1280</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">1280</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">1280\times 1</annotation></semantics></math>) from device raw data.

It determines both the accuracy of device grouping and communication overhead between the cloud and IoT devices.
Since FLDG does not use the LSH functions, we only investigate the impact of output dimension on FLDG-L here.
Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the inference performance of the three benchmarks using LSH functions with different output dimensions.
We tried to investigate the impact of output dimension from 1 to 1280 with a step of 1. Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> only shows four typical cases of them, since when the output dimension is larger than 4, the difference of test accuracy becomes small.
From Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Towards Fast and Accurate Federated Learning with non-IID Data for Cloud-Based IoT Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can find that larger output dimension will lead to a better test accuracy.
This is because larger output dimensions of LSH functions enable more accurate similarity comparisons for device grouping.

In this case, to achieve 40% test accuracy, FLDG-L with 5 groups needs around 200 rounds, while FLDG-L with 50 groups requires less than 40 rounds.
This is mainly because more device groups can make IoT devices more finely clustered, thus making the model update closer to the optimal direction in each round of aggregation.
Moreover, both FLDG and FLDG-L take one IoT device from each group to participate in each round of gradient aggregation.
Consequently, more groups lead to more IoT devices participating in the gradient aggregation, which in turn reduces the number of training rounds to achieve expected test accuracy.</p>

Similarly, in the same round FLDG-L outperforms the two baselines by 11.8% and 44.6%, respectively.
For all the cases, the performance of FLDG-L is similar to that of FLDG.
In other words, although FLDG-L is more secure than FLDG, the performance of FLDG-L can still be guaranteed with negligible LSH hashing overhead.
The reason why our approaches are superior is mainly because our device grouping method can reduce the disadvantages of weight divergence during the FL training process.
Therefore, the model optimization direction of each aggregation round becomes more consistent with the optimization direction of the overall training.
Note that in most cases the performance of K-Center fluctuates greatly.
This is because here K-Center conducts device clustering based on the model similarity in every 10 rounds, where the first round has the best performance while the last round gives the worst performance.
Moreover, we can find that for each benchmark, the four methods in Case 1 have the largest difference, but in Case 4 the four methods have similar performance.
This is because that Case 1 has the most skewed non-IID device data while Case 4 has the
least skewed non-IID device data.
In other words, Case 4 tends to be more IID.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL techniques have been increasingly investigated in IoT domains to enable collaborative learning, they still suffer from low inference performance in non-IID scenarios.
To address this problem, this paper proposed two novel FL methods (i.e., FLDG and FLDG-L) based on device grouping, which can significantly mitigate the disadvantages of weight divergence during the FL model training.
By grouping IoT devices based on the feature maps of their raw data using the K-Means algorithm and selecting one IoT device from each group for the model aggregation per round, the proposed FLDG method can effectively stabilize the convergence of the global model.
To further reduce the risk of privacy exposure of feature maps on the cloud, FLDG-L encodes extracted feature maps using the LSH function and sends their hash values to the cloud for device grouping.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approaches can effectively speed up the global model convergence rate while achieving higher accuracy.</p>
