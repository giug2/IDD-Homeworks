<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The provision of social care applications is crucial for elderly people to improve their quality of life and enables operators to provide early interventions. Accurate predictions of user dropouts in healthy ageing applications are essential since they are directly related to individual health statuses. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have enabled highly accurate predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods that struggle to cope with individual patterns. However, ML requires a substantial amount of data for training, which is challenging due to the presence of personal identifiable information (PII) and the fragmentation posed by regulations. In this paper, we present a federated machine learning (FML) approach that minimizes privacy concerns and enables distributed training, without transferring individual data. We employ collaborative training by considering individuals and organizations under FML, which models both cross-device and cross-silo learning scenarios. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset with non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data among clients, class imbalance and label ambiguity. Our results show that data selection and class imbalance handling techniques significantly improve the predictive accuracy of models trained under FML, demonstrating comparable or superior predictive performance than traditional ML models.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Digitalization has brought a plethora of possibilities for health and social care operations, including early health interventions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which support individuals by enabling self-care practices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. One of the most impactful applications of this digital transformation is the early identification of patterns that indicate an individual might dropout (discontinue) a treatment program. Such applications can significantly enhance individuals’ quality of life, e.g., by minimizing the risk of disease development <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and identifying signs of depression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Building on these advances, the implementation of smart health and social care applications empowers individuals, especially the elderly people, to enhance their overall well-being <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Such digital tools are particularly crucial for elderly people, as they monitor their physical and cognitive activities, having a vital role in improving their health status.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">By integrating machine learning (ML) techniques into these applications, intelligent services can be developed, resulting in substantial advantages for individuals and reduced economic costs for health operators. However, ML algorithms require large amounts of training data to provide highly accurate predictions. The transmission of data that, in the context of health and social care, contain personally identifiable information (PII) to a central server (CS) as well as data sharing among organizations, face limitations due to the increased privacy concerns and the fragmentation posed by regulations such as the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Hence, research efforts have recently turned towards the decentralization of ML, with federated machine learning (FML) emerging as an attractive research area that enables model training without data transmission.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FML, introduced by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, allows the training data to remain distributed on edge devices while a shared model is learned by securely aggregating client-based computed updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Unlike traditional ML, in FML, a CS is responsible for coordinating participating clients and collecting model updates instead of raw data. This distributed approach ensures that the data remains on the clients’ devices, minimizing privacy and security concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although FML has received much attention in recent years, the final model’s predictive accuracy is affected by several challenges introduced by the distributed data, with the most common problem being data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Since FML clients are likely to own different data distributions, careful selection of clients per federated round is crucial for a federated model to converge towards the global objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, determining which clients should be included or excluded during specific federated training rounds is a complex task that involves addressing various issues and considerations such as resource allocation, data quality and quantity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above, we propose the application of a FML-based training to predict early dropouts from active and healthy ageing applications. Timely accurate predictions of dropouts enable early interventions by health and social care operators, reduced economical costs associated with hospitalization and ultimately, improve the quality of life of patients, while preventing them from disease development or mood changes. In this paper, we focus on elderly people and train a deep neural network using FML to minimize privacy related issues.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors predicted individuals’ health conditions using self-reports, utilizing ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Prati et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> used an interview-based dataset to predict the participants’ quality of life, life satisfaction and happiness, employing the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors targeted early interventions by predicting suicide risks. Finally, O’Keeffe et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> focused on predicting the dropouts of individuals receiving therapy for depression to enable early interventions using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite ongoing research efforts, the prevailing literature concerning dropout and treatment engagement prediction in this domain predominantly relies on datasets derived from interviews or self-reports. However, such sources lack real-time dimensionality, which is critical for timely accurate assessment of an individual’s health condition. To address this issue, Fico et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> introduced a novel dataset derived from a mobile application designed for elderly people. The application prompts users to engage in various activities within a gamified environment and collects user acquisitions. The long-term goal is to evaluate user engagement through intelligent predictions, enabling social care operators to implement early interventions.</p>

The dataset was generated by conducting an experiment on elderly people in Spain, who were asked to perform various activities in an application. Among these individuals, there were people with disabilities, e.g., kinetic and memory problems. The dataset consists of user acquisitions related to the requested activities, which belong to one of the following categories: Brain Games, Fingertapping, Mindfulness and Physical Activity. The objective of the MAHA application is to support elderly people by requesting them to participate in a gamified environment by performing at least two activities within a one-week interval. By monitoring the individual acquisitions and predicting user adherence, the application aims to improve the quality of life of elderly people and ultimately, to offer early interventions when a participant’s engagement with the requested activities is low.</p>

In addition, a window of twelve past sessions (or six weeks), containing aggregated statistics regarding the user activity is used as input and the goal is to predict whether a user will interact with the application in the subsequent three sessions. If a user performs acquisitions two or more times during these three sessions, a label of one is assigned, indicating high adherence. Otherwise, a label of zero is assigned, suggesting that the individual is likely to dropout of the application. Following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, there is a class imbalance, where low adherence corresponds to 75% of all instances.

When applied to raw data, the centralized approach achieved an Accuracy of 86%, Precision of 76%, Recall of 67%, F1 score of 71% and a Geometric Mean of 79%. With the utilization of re-sampling techniques to address the influence of class imbalance such as over sampling, undersampling and over-under sampling, we observed a decline in the predictive accuracy. This decrease is attributed to the presence of label ambiguity in our dataset (Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Dataset ‣ III Methodology ‣ Federated Learning for Early Dropout Prediction on Healthy Ageing Applications This publication has been partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the TERMINET project with Grant Agreement No. 957406." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>), where the same features can be associated with both low and high adherence labels. In addition, when we excluded users with low informative content, there was not a significant shift in the model’s predictive performance. The stability of the results across different settings is linked to the centralized model’s capability to access all user data during training. The average metrics and their standard deviation for each technique under centralized learning are summarized in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-C Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Early Dropout Prediction on Healthy Ageing Applications This publication has been partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the TERMINET project with Grant Agreement No. 957406." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

In cross-device FML, the results varied from those observed in the centralized learning setting. Specifically, on the raw data, the model achieved an Accuracy of 82%, Precision of 92%, Recall of 32%, F1 score of 47% and a Geometric Mean of 56%. These results demonstrate a reduction of 5% in Accuracy, 52% in Recall, 34% in F1 score, and 29% in the Geometric Mean when compared to the centralized model. This decrease is attributed to data heterogeneity across individual participants.</p>

<div id="S4.I2.i2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.I2.i2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the centralized setting, the data selection and class imbalance handling techniques showed mixed results. More precisely, the application of over-under sampling in cross-device FML demonstrated a slight improvement of 10% in Recall, 11% in F1 Score and 7% in Geometric Mean compared to the centralized counterpart. Similarly, the under sampling approach resulted in higher accuracy results when compared to the corresponding centralized experiment. In contrast, the introduction of oversampling led to a notable reduction in metrics. Specifically, there is a decline of 47% in Recall, 21% in F1 Score, and 23% in Geometric Mean compared to the outcomes of the centralized experiment. This behavior can be attributed to the high quantity skew of data samples, i.e., varying number of samples, which is present among clients. Characteristically, 85 users own under 100 observations, while a mere 79 has over 200 instances. This differentiation makes it challenging for over sampling algorithms to generate accurate synthetic data and consequently improve the overall predictive performance of the deep learning algorithm.</p>

<div id="S4.I2.i2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.I2.i2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After thoroughly analyzing the results in the cross-device context and contrasting them with the raw data scenario, the findings diverged from initial expectations. Specifically, the utilization of under-sampling increased the Recall by 138%, the F1 score by 51%, and the GM by 45%. Notably, when the cross-device FML is combined with the under-sampling method, it outperforms all other learning scenarios potentially by better capturing irregular patterns among the data distribution.</p>

<p id="S4.I2.i2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Using the data selection approaches, i.e., by excluding users with limited observations for both labels, leads to an improvement in the Recall metric by 97%, F1 score by 47%, and Geometric Mean by 38% compared to raw data training. This suggests that FML models are more susceptible to low quality or noisy content than centralized learning. Since FML models can only access data subsets, the presence of noisy data leads to decreased predictive performance.

In particular, using the raw data, the model achieves an Accuracy of 78%, Precision of 94%, Recall of 15%, F1 score of 26% and Geometric Mean of 38%.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, our experiments suggest that centralized learning consistently provides robust predictions, regardless of the applied data selection and class imbalance strategies. Nevertheless, cross-device FML presents comparable predictive accuracy to centralized learning.

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the sensitive nature of health and social care data, it is important to consider privacy-enhancing learning approaches such as cross-device FML. By incorporating intelligent client selection mechanisms, the predictive performance of FML can exceed that of centralized approaches. Based on our observations, under sampling is a highly effective technique for improving the performance of FML models.</p>

In particular, when we exclude individuals with low information content from the training set, we observe much better results for cross-device FML compared to cross-silo. Furthermore, it should be noted that the results can be further enhanced when the over-under and under sampling techniques are fine-tuned. On the other hand, the use of over sampling techniques leads to a decrease in performance. This behavior aligns consistently with the findings from the cross-device FML experiment.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have explored the effectiveness of Federated Machine Learning (FML) when applied to a real-world scenario in the health and social care domain. We compared two distributed learning settings, namely cross-device and cross-silo FML, to traditional centralized learning. Our empirical findings suggest that the careful data selection or the utilization of re-sampling techniques can significantly improve the predictive performance of federated learning methods. On the other hand, such techniques did not affect the accuracy of centralized learning. Furthermore, our analysis shows that in specific scenarios, particularly when using under sampling within the cross-device federated setting, FML-based training can surpass other methods in terms of predictive accuracy. This finding indicates that federated learning not only minimizes privacy concerns but with the application of intelligent data selection or re-sampling algorithms, it can outperform centralized approaches, thereby achieving highly accurate predictions in the context of predicting early user dropouts from healthy ageing applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Future research could delve deeper into understanding the optimal threshold for excluding users from training, identify the most appropriate re-sampling method for each use case and explore alternative client selection techniques to enhance the model’s predictive performance. By gaining a better understanding of the underlying factors that influence the predictive accuracy in federated settings, we can refine preprocessing strategies and improve the overall efficacy of machine learning models applied in real-world scenarios.</p>
