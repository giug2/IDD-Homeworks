<p id="id34.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id34.id1.1" class="ltx_text">In this paper, we increase the availability and integration of devices in the learning process to enhance the convergence of federated learning (FL) models. To address the issue of having all the data in one location, federated learning, which maintains the ability to learn over decentralized data sets, combines privacy and technology. Until the model converges, the server combines the updated weights obtained from each dataset over a number of rounds. The majority of the literature suggested client selection techniques to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. However, none of the existing proposals have focused on the flexibility to deploy and select clients as needed, wherever and whenever that may be. Due to the extremely dynamic surroundings, some devices are actually not available to serve as clients in FL, which affects the availability of data for learning and the applicability of the existing solution for client selection. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an On-Demand-FL, a client deployment approach for FL, offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of the containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient environments using IoT and mobile devices serving as volunteers. Furthermore, Kubernetes is used for orchestration. The Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem due to its evolutionary strategy. The performed experiments using the Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset and the Localfed framework illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the on-the-fly deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed with less discarded rounds and more available data.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the brain of smart systems which became the core of our daily lives through close interactions. With endless opportunities when using AI technologies, researchers look forward to develop robust and intelligent models to serve the community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Being the main pillar of smart technologies, data generated by smart devices should be collected from various entities and locations while maintaining top of the line privacy during data collection, transfer, training, and models deployment in production. Researchers try to maximize the quality of service (QoS), security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and communication quality in future smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Today’s users have access to mobile and edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which provide vast amounts of data that can be used in numerous AI applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, privacy concerns are limiting the public’s access to such data, particularly when it comes from individual smartphones or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where researchers try to optimize multiple aspects related to fog and IoT devices using these data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the restriction on sharing private data has an impact on the process of developing and refining AI systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The recently used FL scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> helps mobile devices train machine learning models using their own data. The process includes selecting a group of accessible devices to take part in a learning phase, which is repeated numerous times until the model converges. The clients communicate the new weights to the server at the end of each round, where they are aggregated to create the overall model. The mechanism used by default to choose the clients who will take part in each round is randomness. However, selecting some clients could result in dropping out before finishing the learning rounds when working with devices that have restricted capabilities and resources. Additionally, a high volume of transferred updates may make communication between the clients and the server expensive and slow. Choosing a trustworthy group of customers in this situation can assist reduce redundant gradient information and improve network congestion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the distribution of classes in federated learning is unbalanced, with some classes outnumbering others. Therefore, selecting clients with similar class labels may lead to biased and flawed models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The literature provides solutions for client selection that handle the majority of the aforementioned issues using a variety of approaches. However, none of the prior work proposes on-demand client deployment in the context of federated learning, by deploying clients instantly in extremely dynamic situations. Devices with poor learning resources and capabilities are missing out on the opportunity to participate in learning. However, new devices can easily and effectively participate in learning thanks to containerization technologies. Moreover, smart devices are busy at specific period of the day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The availability and resources needed in the area of interest can thus be provided anytime, anyplace, through the on-demand system. A tool for efficiently creating Kubernetes clusters is called Kubeadm. These clusters can be created using any resource-constrained device with the help of a master node.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Containerization technology is more lightweight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> than virtual machines. For that, the containerization technology has been used to deploy some services on fog devices near the IoT users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> for maximizing the quality of services. By suggesting an on-demand and on-the-fly client deployment method for federated learning based on Kubeadm and Docker, we take advantage of containerization technologies in this work. Due to the limited number of available clients, our suggested architecture enables a rapid deployment of new clients to participate in environments with data shortages. Moreover, our plan takes into account the device motions and locations, which have a significant impact on the quantity and heterogeneity of the data generated. Additionally, the on-the-fly deployment configures users for learning by taking into account their areas of interest. To illustrate the contributions and advantages of our approach, we use the MDC dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, to represent real life simulation. The LocalFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> helps in applying FL models and to be integrated with the proposed genetic algorithm solution. We take real life scenarios that require on the fly client deployment to serve some machine learning models. First, we assume that there are a considerable number of devices moving (i.e., a lot of relevant data) in a client environment without any learning capabilities. Deploying containers on devices situated in these locations is quite advantageous in this regard to utilize such a vast volume of created data. Second, we assume that the environment is not entirely set up for learning and embedding volunteer client devices that are active in the neighborhood. In this situation, while taking into account our objective functions and limitations, our on-the-fly deployment technique enables proficient clients to engage effectively in the learning process and environment. Such scenarios motivate the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> where more intelligent resource provisioning is required in such areas. The tests conducted in this paper produced encouraging outcomes in terms of fewer rounds, higher volume and heterogeneous data, improved accuracy in the early stages, less discarded rounds in the learning, and deployment of on-demand models and clients anywhere, anytime.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, researchers have made significant contributions to federated learning’s communication, cost, security, privacy, and accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In this section, we provide an overview of the recent related work in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> emphasized the significance of managing IoT resources while installing services on them utilizing lightweight technology like Docker containerization. A fog-formation on-demand architecture was given by the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Fog devices often have specified locations and conduct specific services. The authors used containerization technology to deploy containers quickly and install the required services on the devices in order to increase device availability. Additionally, based on this design, fog devices can now be installed and made available to use whenever and wherever volunteers are located. The developers of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> extended on this architecture by proposing an on-demand micro-services deployment with the lowest possible cost while maintaining reachability between the desired customers and the accessible vehicular fog clusters. Furthermore, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> tried to operate the placement of services proactively using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
We make use of this architecture in our work to dynamically allocate and deploy prepared clients to take part in a federated learning round using containers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors find a solution to the issue of a bottleneck when there are a lot of customers in FL. The authors suggested a system that only chooses a few clients that are carrying representative gradient data to send changes to the server. Submodularity was used by the writers of this research to encourage the diversity of the chosen clients, which helped them achieve their goals. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, it is not necessary to select a maximum number of clients throughout each round as most of the proposed client selection approaches concentrate when selecting the maximum number of clients who can update their models. We can reduce training loss and increase accuracy by choosing fewer clients in the early rounds and more in the latter ones. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> suggested a dynamic optimization based on a trade-off between increasing selection and lowering participant clients’ energy usage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Using optimization techniques, some strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> try to balance the trade-off between the client consumption and the learning rate. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> developed a new sampling technique that combines customers into pools for easy selection and summarizes their attributes in a single floating point. In addition, the suggested model achieves 50–80% faster convergence in a high-class imbalance and a low-data environment.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> attempted to improve the routing protocols’ level of service and privacy. They were successful in segmenting the routing domain into advantageous subdomains, and federated reinforcement learning is used to maintain privacy. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed an effective FL-based algorithm for anomaly detection. Multiple local deep reinforcement learning models were used to build the FL, which prevents privacy leakage while also suggesting a leaking technique to boost prediction. Additionally, authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> utilized FL and Blockchain to offer a trustworthy and secure energy solution for trade between numerous businesses. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> suggested deep federated learning for health care data. Recently, researchers started to focus on healthcare systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. For instance, in order to diagnose COVID-19, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> suggested a clustered FL method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For selecting clients, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> suggested a multi-criteria model. The system takes into account the clients’ resources to forecast the amount of time needed to complete the jobs without stopping the process until convergence. Additionally, according to a report by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, IoT and mobile devices can get quite active at certain times of the day. As a result, the number of clients participating in the FL process significantly relies on the time of day, with a low number during the day and an increase of 4x at night that may result in the discarding of certain learning rounds. In order to guarantee a balanced, impartial model, the developers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> suggested a new scheduling architecture based on the historical participation of each edge device.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Mobile and IoT devices provide a lot of data in a highly dynamic environment, including photos, location histories, the whereabouts of autonomous vehicles, and captured images. Full access to such data would allow for the development of powerful machine learning models that could provide reliable and intelligent services. However, security and privacy are major concerns for data owners. FL has been suggested in this context as a decentralized solution that combines intelligence with privacy. It comprises of a machine learning model that is shared by a number of clients and uses locally learned data. Initially, the server generates a model to serve a certain task and then asks a random set of clients of size <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K\times C" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">K</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">C</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐾</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝐶</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">K\times C</annotation></semantics></math> to participate in each round and exchange parameters with the server, where <math id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> is the number of available clients, and <math id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">C</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝐶</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">C</annotation></semantics></math> is the portion of clients considered. The chosen model is then trained on each selected client’s local data, and the new derived parameters are sent to the server. The server then combines the gathered parameters and calculates a FedAvg to build upon and improve the overall model. Multiple rounds of this technique are carried out to improve convergence and precision. However, failing from or report later the new parameters causes the server to end the round, which could slow down or stop the learning process altogether. Therefore, the chosen clients must be available throughout a FL training round. The quantity of resources that are accessible throughout the entire round serves as the definition of this availability. Additionally, a learning environment must be set up by connecting to the server, gathering the necessary materials, installing them, and beginning the training procedure.</p>

From a collection of constrained devices, Kubernetes clusters may be effectively built using the Kubeadm tool. In this work, we suggest creating the cluster on-the-fly using the server and the devices that are willing to volunteer. The server or service provider, orchestrators or small servers, and user devices make up the three levels that constitute the architecture. In the following section, we go over how each layer fits into the overall architecture flow.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">According to our architecture, the server is in charge of providing clients with container images, managing the global model, and keeping a safe connection with the lower levels. Additionally, with the help of the orchestrator, the server is in charge of making decisions as they arise regarding the participation of nodes in cluster formation. The Kubeadm clusters must be created by the orchestrators, who are also in charge of managing container deployment, tracking device movements in their area, and adding new clients to the cluster. In cases of high mobility, the orchestrators are also in charge of handling client deployment and selection as well as sending requests to the server for container deployment on clients. The orchestration layer’s key benefits are its ability to reduce the risk of a single point of failure and to speed up operations, especially in highly dynamic circumstances. Additionally, having an orchestrator for each client group manages server resources and helps cut down on network connection overhead.
For FL, when data is used without sharing, the volunteering fog devices act as clients. With the help of lightweight containers and our on-demand architecture, clients may execute a machine learning model whenever and wherever they want. The related service will not be running on any device besides those taking part in the FL rounds.</p>

<div id="S3.SS7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">On the mini-servers that are accessible in each area, the server first starts by initializing a few orchestrators. The first orchestrators are chosen based on client device motions that the server has only just begun to collect. The orchestrators are then in charge of carrying out this task. In an area where there are many devices that are willing to volunteer, the server first tries to push orchestrators there. Additionally, the server determines if the day is a weekend or a weekday so that it can determine earlier on where to place some orchestrators. In the context of this article, we assume that a list of potential mini-server orchestrators is accessible. In summary, the server (1) chooses the locations where Kubernetes clusters will be created and some of its devices will receive container deployments, and (2) when the orchestrator node is initially configured, adds some willing devices to the cluster. All of the devices that can volunteer in the region where the orchestrator is created are prompted by the server to join the Kubeadm cluster. The Kubeadm environment is now prepared to push services as needed without any setup lag. Additionally, the Master node must always be active alongside the volunteers. The cluster collapses if the master node is down. From this point forward, in the event that the first orchestrator goes down, the orchestrator or master node must always select a different available mini-server in the area to switch to. As a result, there is no longer a need to start again with a fresh Kubeadm cluster and waste time initializing everything. We presume that each region has an enough number of mini-servers. If no mini-servers are accessible, the module may select a client device to act as an orchestrator for a brief period of time while taking into account its profile information. This process should be written as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is outside the scope of this study but will be taken into account in subsequent work. For now, we consider that the chosen nodes to serve as orchestrators are suitable to run the tasks.</p>

An orchestrator will ask the server to deploy containers and some of the chosen clients in its area if it sees significant movement in the area. High movements generate a large amount of data, which helps a model be better trained. The client manager also keeps track of how many rounds each user has served. Our technique prevents starvation in client selection for subsequent rounds by keeping track of how many rounds a client has participated in overall. Additionally, this module handles a node’s remaining time in the cluster and examines its average staying time in a region to help us reach our training goal. When making the selection in the following round, it’s crucial to take the cluster’s average remaining time into account. Additionally, the client manager notifies the server of the availability of any new client devices that enter the area.</p>

Additionally, selecting the node as an orchestrator raises some security issues, but this subject is outside the purview of this work. We assume that the server has confidence in the accessible mini-servers. To aid in the selection of the orchestrator, the orchestrator manager uses the historical data of users who have already trained some models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The movements of the clients should be taken into account when choosing the orchestrators. The server also considers whether it is a weekend or a weekday, and on weekends it deploys some orchestrators in areas with certain mountainous terrain where people may be more active. The server performs this at regular intervals, and each orchestrator tracks its clients’ movements after that. In order for the server to determine the areas of interest, this module also handles requests from orchestrators to deploy additional containers in their area. Additionally, this module is in charge of choosing clients from various areas in order to guarantee data heterogeneity and manage class imbalance.</p>

One of the features that our model uses to optimize the deployment is client movements. This feature is monitored by the orchestrators and recorded as a counter for each client visiting a specific place. Based on this, choosing always high movements clients leads to similar selection every round. Henceforth, to avoid repetition in selection, the server chooses a threshold to determine the percentage of clients with high movements. A client is in high movement if <math id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Movements_{C_{i}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p6.1.m1.1.1"

<p id="S4.I1.i1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Minimizing the number of active hosts saves energy and resource consumption, which means less battery, CPU, and memory consumption of the overall available clients. This results in increasing the availability of fog devices, and thus, other services or applications can use the extra amount of available hosts in an area. Moreover, in FL, the server and client devices struggle with the high rate of exchanging parameters and updating weights. Following this objective, the high congestion on the network is decreased. As already discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, it is unnecessary to select a maximum number of clients to participate in each round. Selecting fewer clients at the early stages and more clients in later rounds helps improving the training loss while reaching higher accuracy.

<p id="S4.I1.i3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Checking the local accuracy and having a history of score of the un-deployed clients helps in extracting useful information about the kind of data these clients have. A higher accuracy means that the client’s testing data is somehow good for the model. Therefore, including their training data will boost the model accuracy by deploying such clients at early stages. Maximizing the accuracy of a model results in better performance and quality decisions. In addition, having the accuracy high at early stages (rounds) helps real-time systems that are using the global model.

Reparation is performed by moving containers to other client devices if the machine learning exceeds
(1) the resource capacity of a client
(2) the client’s staying period in a particular area
(3) the ”high movement” threshold decided by the server.

Afterward, normal selection, crossover,
and mutation operators are applied, infeasible solutions are repaired, and finally, the
Pareto set is updated if improvements are possible. This process is repeated in multiple iterations. In our GA algorithm, we use binary tournament selection in order to choose individuals from populations. The crossover method used is the one-point crossover where the crossover is probabilistically applied for each parent, controlled by a hyper-parameter. Moreover, for the mutation phase, the bit string mutation is used.

It consists of continuous records illustrating the movements of clients recorded over a period of time. We extracted from this dataset several features to help us predict the next place the clients are heading to. Global Positioning System (GPS) features were used to cluster 20 places and 6 area locations in a specific region on the map. Each area location contains different places. Time features were extracted and represented in several features like: day, month, year, weekend or weekday. We added an important feature to track the duration of a visit to a place by those users by calculating The duration of stay. Furthermore, frequency and rate of visits are extracted to track the locations of presence every month. Finally, the label class is added, corresponding to the next place a client visited in a specific duration of time.</p>

Localfed is known for its feasibility in applying FL applications using built-in components. These components are implemented in Python. It requires different parameters to control the behavior of the model. The trainer manager is responsible to define how the trainers are running, along with passing some parameters to define the number of epochs and loss. The aggregator instance is responsible to merge the collected models into a global model. The metrics component is responsible to test the model accuracy and loss on testing data after each round. Moreover, Trainers-data-dict defines the data of each client saved in dictionaries. After that, we define some parameters like the number of rounds, desired accuracy, train, and test data ratios.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Other components were added by us like Data Distribution and Base Model. The Data Distribution component was added to efficiently distribute the data to the clients. Since we are dealing with real-life dataset and specifically user-based. We assigned to each client the data of one user available in the dataset. This was done to simulate real-life scenario in which clients/users have the data on their side. The Base Model component is added in order to run any machine learning (ML) model under FL.</p>

However, most of these devices can be busy or do not have enough capabilities to be used as clients in FL. This results in postponing the process of learning or even neglecting the chance of having a ML process applied to them. On the other hand, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR ON-DEMAND-FL ‣ ON-DEMAND-FL: A Dynamic and Efficient Multi-Criteria Federated Learning Client Deployment Scheme" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, using containerization technology to deploy docker containers on these machines results in having more available devices in the area. The containerization technology was proved to be efficient and more lightweight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> than virtual machines. For that, our architecture can make use of any constrained devices in this environment to serve as a client in each FL round. We start by having zero available clients, and as can be seen that by deploying containers on the volunteering devices more devices are becoming available. It is also noticed that the use of dynamic devices moving inside and outside the environment (area). Such devices can be used if reachable throughout the learning round. This process is available in our architecture since the ”Client Deployment” component deploys those dynamic clients if their average staying period in this area is greater than the threshold needed to finish a learning round. Hence, this allows more diversity of clients to choose from. Moreover, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR ON-DEMAND-FL ‣ ON-DEMAND-FL: A Dynamic and Efficient Multi-Criteria Federated Learning Client Deployment Scheme" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, our architecture can make use of weak static and dynamic devices in each area to make them available for learning. Therefore, we can efficiently and on-demand deploy clients in any environment having volunteering devices.</p>

Since client devices participate in a small number of rounds throughout the day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, our approach succeeds to have fewer rounds to reach convergence while deploying clients at the right time and location while taking into consideration multiple constraints.

We calculate the number of rounds our approach takes to converge versus the default random client selection. To converge, our approach took on average 6-8 learning rounds, while this number was increased to 14-18 when using the default method, taking into assumption that enough client devices exist.

In FL, it is essential to take resources consumption and the movement of clients into consideration to make less number of client devices drop out from the learning due to resource overwhelming or reachability issues (for dynamic clients). Based on the available devices in an area, our architecture tries to deploy a set of these clients to participate in each round. As previously explained, by using our architecture there is a higher number of available clients. Therefore, there are more clients to choose from along with higher diversity. The number of deployed clients by the proposed model starts with a small set of clients which is 5 and increases this number in each round to reach 15-20.

So a constant portion of clients is selected even though they might not be ready or prepared for the learning.

On the other hand, using the default selection method, some of the selected clients did not respond back to the server. This depends on the constraints that our model takes into consideration and VanillaFL does not. Having a large number of clients failing to report back their updates yields the server to drop this round, which makes the overall process takes longer. Moreover, the constant number of selected clients by the FLVanilla framework leads to have fewer available clients to participate in other applications. On the other hand, our architecture makes use of a small amount of clients and makes the rest of the clients available for other ML applications to be applied in these areas. Our proposed model results in a few discarded rounds out of the 50 rounds, compared to the default method where the majority of the clients are misselected.</p>

Henceforth, our approach achieves less communication rounds. Moreover, using our orchestrators to exchange and deal with the deployed clients make the server less busy and congested to run other models and applications at the same time. As shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-D Distribution of Data Over Clients ‣ VI EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATION RESULTS ‣ ON-DEMAND-FL: A Dynamic and Efficient Multi-Criteria Federated Learning Client Deployment Scheme" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> we can see that the number of used communication rounds on the network using our proposed model is greater than of VanillaFL. The 10% of the discarded rounds while using our proposed model results from: (1) if the client receives an invitation to deploy a service having higher priority than the ML service, or (2) if the deployed client changes its destination or its usual staying period in this place and area location. On the other hand, we can see that more than 50% of the communication rounds are discarded while using VanillaFL framework, due to the random selection and the constant number of clients that the framework should choose even when we do not have such available or capable clients in the area. Furthermore, the default static devices can be far from the server and result in a long time to deliver the updates. Having close client devices supports in lowering the number of discarded communication rounds.</p>

This number is increasing while having the ability to deploy volunteers to serve as clients. The orchestrators play an important role while monitoring the average movements and visited places by the users. Once a high movement of devices is noticed in their area, a request is sent to the server to favor this area for some client deployments. Having high activities of devices in a location leads to generating a large volume of data that can be used in the learning. In addition, having a heterogeneity of clients results in having more diversity in the output class that we are trying to predict at each end. This helps the model to converge faster when having Non-iid data.

Higher local accuracy means its testing data are somehow close to the data that the model trained on. Therefore, deploying such clients at early stages results in having more related training data to the model, which will push the accuracy at early stages as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-E Experiments and results ‣ VI EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATION RESULTS ‣ ON-DEMAND-FL: A Dynamic and Efficient Multi-Criteria Federated Learning Client Deployment Scheme" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary issues addressed in this article are client availability and on-demand client deployment capability. We solve these issues by making use of the volunteering devices that are available everywhere in the designated regions. We utilize Kubeadm and Docker to manage on-the-fly deployments and to set up clients everywhere we go, whenever we need them. The server, the orchestrator, and the user are the three layers that make up our framework. We propose a multi-objective optimization solution to solve the client deployment problem. A heuristic
model based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is elaborated for solving the multi-objective client/model deployment.
The experimental findings show the viability, efficiency, and improvement of applying the on-demand client deployment, where less time is required to achieve the desired precision compared with the default selection framework and the centralized model. Real-world scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the viability of client deployment in static regions and the advantages of having additional clients available in a learning environment. As future work, we plan to extend our architecture and optimize the client deployment by having multiple FL applications running in our environment.</p>
