<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Wireless ad hoc federated learning (WAFL) is a fully decentralized collaborative machine learning framework organized by opportunistically encountered mobile nodes. Compared to conventional federated learning, WAFL performs model training by weakly synchronizing the model parameters with others, and this shows great resilience to a poisoned model injected by an attacker. In this paper, we provide our theoretical analysis of the WAFL’s resilience against model poisoning attacks, by formulating the force balance between the poisoned model and the legitimate model. According to our experiments, we confirmed that the nodes directly encountered the attacker has been somehow compromised to the poisoned model but other nodes have shown great resilience. More importantly, after the attacker has left the network, all the nodes have finally found stronger model parameters combined with the poisoned model. Most of the attack-experienced cases achieved higher accuracy than the no-attack-experienced cases.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cyber attacks on machine intelligence may result in unexpected catastrophic disasters especially when we fully rely on the machine’s decisions. Recent advancement in federated learning has allowed training machines without exchanging privacy-sensitive data. Instead, they exchange the model itself, which means that the access (read and write) to the intelligence is open to any entities including malicious entities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the need for ad hoc federation among the nodes physically nearby, wireless ad hoc federated learning (WAFL) has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. WAFL assumes that autonomous vehicles, smart devices, or sensor nodes have multi-vendor issues and cannot rely on a centralized parameter server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> operated by third-party organizations. Instead, WAFL utilizes ad hoc connections among those devices for collaborative learning in a fully distributed manner without any centralized or third-party mechanisms as cooperative intelligent transport systems do <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Here, security in such an open and fully distributed learning framework is an important topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study model poisoning attacks against legitimate nodes that are collaboratively learning with WAFL. We especially focus on analyzing the resilience of WAFL against model poisoning attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to conventional federated learning, we consider that WAFL has more resilience because of its fully distributed nature. Federated learning has a critical attack point “global model”, which is synchronized among the participating nodes. If the model is somehow poisoned by a malicious node, the compromised model would be synchronized to all the nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, WAFL does not have such a critical attack point. In WAFL, each node has its own generalized model, developed by model exchange and aggregation among the nodes encountered. These generalized models are weakly-synchronized with each other at every contact, but not fully synchronized as a global model. Thus, we expect that an attack on one of the generalized models cannot fully poison all the models possessed by the distributed nodes in the network. Besides, because legitimate nodes continuously inject legitimate models for developing generalized models, the impact of the attack would be propagated but rapidly weakened as the hop count increases from the attacker (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Resilience of Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was proposed with expectations of protecting users’ privacy by exposing the global model to participating users and local training without exchanging the user’s data. However, this model exposure including the downloading/uploading interface brought another risk to the machine learning model such as poisoning attack<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and privacy leakage<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

Backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has been mainly considered by poisoning the data while training, but is also studied in the context of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The idea is to upload a backdoor-enabled model to a central parameter server, replacing the global model with it.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some defense mechanisms for model poisoning attack in federated learning has been also studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> in the recent literature.

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In peer-to-peer federated learning, Sun et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Li et. al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> have proposed Blockchain-based protection mechanisms against such a malicious model update. They introduce a consensus mechanism for the acceptance of model updates. If the update could not get voted approval by more than half of the committees, it will not be aggregated into the global model. However, the work still assumes a single global model, which cannot be applicable to WAFL.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless ad hoc federated learning (WAFL) seems to have the same risks as conventional federated learning in that WAFL also exposes model parameters among the participated nodes. However, because WAFL is totally distributed without any centralized mechanisms, model poisoning attacks made to a node cannot be easily propagated to all the participating nodes. As long as we surveyed, the analysis of model poisoning attacks to such a distributed framework was not studied in the past.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To observe the poisoned model propagation, we have configured a static network scenario named static_line by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.

We assumed legitimate training from epoch 0 to 500, and then an attacker joins at Node 0 or at Node 9, persistently pushing constant poisoned models at each epoch. The attacker leaves the network at epoch 2000, and the whole training process ends at epoch 2500.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The poisoned models we prepared are RMP, SSC (4,9), SDC (1,6), and COD (0,6). RMP is generated by just initializing the model’s network at random. SSC (4,9) is generated by training with the MNIST training dataset by swapping the labels between 4 and 9. In the same way, SDC (1,6) by swapping 1 and 6. COD (0,6) is generated by reassigning label 6 to label 0 data samples. We have run 100 epochs with a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 0.0001, and the Adam optimizer.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the COD attack, we have specifically considered depressing label 0 because we specifically evaluate the attack from node 9. Because of the Non-IID configuration, only node 0 has labeled 0 samples primarily and strongly contributes to updating the model to classify and output 0. With this configuration, we observe the force balance between attacker and node 0 – node 0 defends the label 0 output, whereas the attacker mounted at node 9 depresses the output of 0.</p>

In this paper, we focused on the static_line network topology and MNIST dataset classification problem in the Non-IID scenario as a benchmark evaluation. As a result, we have found that WAFL can show good resilience in both model parameters and accuracy against model poisoning attacks. We have even found that attack-experienced models can achieve higher accuracy because the disturbance can contribute to finding a better optimal model. We here list further research items.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented our analysis of the WAFL’s resilience against model poisoning attacks. As WAFL is fully distributed and collaboratively trains generalized models, WAFL shows great resilience to a poisoned model injected by an attacker. This force balance has been theoretically analyzed in this paper. Our experiment results have shown that the nodes directly encountered the attacker has been somehow compromised to the poisoned model but other nodes have shown their resilience. All the nodes have finally found stronger model parameters combined with the poisoned model. Consequently, most of the attack-experienced cases achieved higher accuracy than the no-attack experienced cases after the recovery.</p>
