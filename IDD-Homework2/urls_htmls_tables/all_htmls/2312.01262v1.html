<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Existing state-of-the-art 3D point cloud understanding methods merely perform well in a fully supervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no unified framework that simultaneously solves the downstream high-level understanding tasks including both segmentation and detection, especially when labels are extremely limited. This work presents a general and simple framework to tackle point cloud understanding when labels are limited. The first contribution is that we have done extensive methodology comparisons of traditional and learned 3D descriptors for the task of weakly supervised 3D scene understanding, and validated that our adapted traditional PFH-based 3D descriptors show excellent generalization ability across different domains. The second contribution is that we proposed a learning-based region merging strategy based on the affinity provided by both the traditional/learned 3D descriptors and learned semantics. The merging process takes both low-level geometric and high-level semantic feature correlations into consideration. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has the best performance among the three most important weakly supervised point clouds understanding tasks including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection even when very limited number of points are labeled. Our method, termed Region Merging 3D (RM3D), has superior performance on ScanNet data-efficient learning online benchmarks and other four large-scale 3D understanding benchmarks under various experimental settings, outperforming current arts by a margin for various 3D understanding tasks without complicated learning strategies such as active learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">3D vision has great potentials in autonomous driving and robotics grasping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022industrialTIE</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022robustmm</span> </a></cite>. We tackle the 3D scene understanding problem, which typically consists of the three most important downstream tasks: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. It becomes increasingly important recently with the wide deployment of 3D sensors, such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. The 3D point clouds are the raw sensor data obtained by 3D sensors and the most common 3D data representation for scene understanding. The 3D data processing and scene understanding techniques have large potentials in the applications such as 3D robotic grasping, autonomous driving, and industrial applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2017avoiding</span> </a></cite>. 
<br class="ltx_break">However, the 3D point cloud annotation often requires a long time and intensive manual labor. Besides, the majority of point cloud understanding methods rely on heavy annotations. For instance, it requires approximately half an hour per scene with thousands of scenes for ScanNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">dai2017scannet</span> </a></cite> or S3DIS. Though existing point clouds understanding methods have achieved good results on these datasets, it is difficult to directly extend them to new scenes since they require a large number of high-quality labels at training; but not all the scenes contain a rich number of labels. For large-scale common indoor/outdoor scenes in robotics interaction and autonomous driving, it becomes more unrealistic. Therefore, weakly supervised learning (WSL)-based 3D point clouds understanding is highly in demand. Motivated by the success of WSL in images, many works start to tackle weakly supervised understanding with fewer labels, but great challenges remain. In general, the previous methods suffers from a lot of limitations. The graph network-based 3D WSL is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">wang2020weakly</span> </a></cite>. However, it still relies on heavy annotation costs for semantic labeling of 2D images projected from 3D point clouds, as well as the information loss when the 3D point clouds are transformed to 2D images, The MPRM has complicated pre-processing and pre-training process, and the customized sub-clouds level labeling is also required, The recently proposed contrastive learning-based pretraining methods lack relationship mining both in low-level geometry and high-level semantics. Therefore, there is a lot of room to explore in how to fully unleash the capacity of WSL to make full use of weak-labeled 3D points in the limited annotation cases, and mining semantic/geometric correlations among the weakly-labeled regions and also the unlabeled regions. Also, how to leverage the both the 3D geometry information and 3D semantics to conduct representation learning in an end-to-end manner remains a problem to be solved.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by challenges above in data-efficient 3D scene understanding, we study how to take advantage of low-level geometries to make full use of limited labels to realize multi-tasks point clouds WSL involving 3D semantic segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, and 3D object detection. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we utilize an unsupervised method for generating initial regions by region expansion based on local normal, curvature, and traditional or learnt 3D descriptors, which encompasses prominent geometric characteristics of 3D objects. Next, we put forward to utilize the backbone network to produce region-level similarity prediction, which predicts the similarities among regions in the latent space. Then the region merging is applied iteratively to aggregate similar regions guided by both the traditional or learnt 3D descriptors and high-level semantic relationships to produce pseudo labels. We design self-supervised learning schemes to optimize the network with data augmentation losses to merge and propagate the weak labels to semantically similar regions. We directly use the results of instance segmentation to provide supervisions for object detection.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Extracting a discriminative local descriptor is very significant for downstream tasks of 3D scene understanding. In the past few years, various 3D descriptors have been proposed. The 3D local feature description is essentially extracting a feature vector around the query point to describe 3D local geometry. The 3D descriptor can be further divided into the histogram-based and signature-based approaches. The histogram-based approaches encode the local geometric variations and put them into the histogram. The typical histogram-based approaches include PFH and FPFH, and the typical signature-based approaches include SHOT. The differences between FPFH and PFH lie in following aspects. Firstly, FPFH merely has partial connected neighbours, while PFH has fully connected neighbours. And the range of neighbourhood is also different. Secondly, in PFH, each edge is counted only once, while in FPFH, a portion of edges are counted twice.

The concept of local reference frame has been proposed by SHOT to build a canonical pose of the local neighborhood. By this kind of design, it can achieve the rotational robustness and 6D-pose independence. Based on or similar to the above mentioned descriptors, many signature-based approaches such as the Heat Kernel Signature (HKS), and the Wave Kernel Signature (WKS), the Scale-Invariant Heat Kernel Signatures (SIKS) have been proposed, which are based on HKS. We have also analysed and compared the traditional visual similarity-based descriptor and the voxel cloud connectivity-based descriptor. The voxel connectivity-based approach can encourage generating segmented regions without crossing object boundaries by means of seeding methods based in 3D space and the flow-constrained local iterative clustering using color and geometrical features. The details of them and their advantages and drawbacks are illustrated in Subsection <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Traditional Versus Learning-based Descriptors ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. Extensive evaluations and comparisons of these descriptors for various tasks of 3D scene understanding are shown in experimental results in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The detailed performance of these descriptors for the tasks of oversegmentation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation are all evaluated and compared in a detailed way. Moreover, we have proposed the adapted traditional and simple contrastive-learning based learnt 3D descriptors can be integrated with our method to achieve weakly supervised 3D scene understanding with SOTAs performance.</p>

Many recent works proposed to pre-train networks on source datasets with auxiliary tasks such as the low-level point cloud geometric registration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xie2020pointcontrast</span> </a></cite>, the local structure prediction, the completion task of the occluded point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">wang2021unsupervised</span> </a></cite>, and the high-level supervised point cloud semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">eckart2021self</span> </a></cite>, with effective learning strategies such as contrastive learning and generative models. Then, they fine-tuned the weights of the trained networks for the target 3D understanding tasks to boost performance on the target dataset. However, all the above methods require accessibility to high-quality fully annotated training data, which are hard to obtain for large-scale 3D scenes. It should be noted that 2D image and point cloud can be reciprocal in both scene understanding and generation. Recent approaches propose using distilled information from 2D image segmentation to assist 3D scene understanding. Also, it has recently be studied that the image can bridge the big semantic gap between the modalities of text and 3D shapes. Also, the LiDAR-based approaches are of significance to many industrial applications such as UAV/robotics inspections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022robustmm</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022industrialTIE</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022semi</span> </a></cite> and robotic enhanced large-scale localization in the diverse complex environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022light</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022weaklabel3d</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022robustcyb</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022robust</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022integratedtrack</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2023dlc</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022enhanced</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022enhancedarxiv</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022lightarxiv</span> </a></cite>, and large-scale robotic scene parsing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2021fg</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022fg</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2020fg</span> </a></cite>, as well as robotic control as well as manipulation applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2017avoiding</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2023lidar</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022integrateduav</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022integratednoise</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022datasetsicca</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2023learning</span> </a></cite>, etc. Differently, we make the first attempt in traditional and learnt 3D descriptor guided weakly supervised point cloud segmentation.</p>

Current approaches for weakly supervised 3D scene understanding can be divided into three main categories: consistency learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xu2020weakly</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">shi2021label</span> </a></cite>, pseudo label-based self-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2021one</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">cheng2021sspc</span> </a></cite>, and contrastive pre-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">hou2021exploring</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xie2020pointcontrast</span> </a></cite>. However, current weakly supervised point cloud understanding approaches are far from mature and have their own limitations. The graph-based 3D WSL was proposed to transform point clouds to images for obtaining semantic map, but image-level labels are required for training. Sub-cloud annotations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">wei2020multi</span> </a></cite> require the extra labour to separate sub-clouds and to label points within the sub-clouds. Directly extending current art methods with weak labels for training will result in a great decline in performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2022fg</span> </a></cite> if label percentage drops to a certain value, which is less than 1‰. Self-training techniques have been utilized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2021one</span> </a></cite> to design a two-stage training scheme to produce pseudo labels from weak labels with the 3D scenes, but it is only tested for the semantic segmentation task with limited performance. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xu2020weakly</span> </a></cite> adopts semi-supervised training strategies combining training with coarse-grained scene class level information and with partial points using on tenth labels, but their test datasets are limited and it is tough to uniformly choose points to label. The network is elaborately made to approximate the gradient during the learning process, where the auxiliary 3D spatial constraints and color-level evenness were also considered in the network optimizations. However, the approach was restricted to the object part segmentation, and it is difficult to annotate points in a well-proportioned and homogeneous way as required. The unsupervised pre-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">hou2021exploring</span> </a></cite> shows great capacity in unleashing the potential of weak labels to serve for complicated tasks, such as instance segmentation. But merely utilizing pre-training can not make full utilization of the weak labels, which results in dis-satisfactory performance. The concurrent work also explores the weakly-supervised video anomaly detection by magnitude contrastive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">MGFN</span> </a></cite> and the weakly supervised semantic segmentation with image-level supervision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">qi2016augmented</span> </a></cite>. However, our studied modality which is 3D point cloud is different in the modality and has essentially different properties with images or videos.</p>

It is very easily influenced by the point density especially in the outdoor scenes with sparse LiDAR points. The reason is that it takes the distances between points into consideration, which is sensitive to density for downstream tasks of 3D scene understanding. For example, for the outdoor case, the close-to-center point clouds will be denser, and the distance between point clouds will be smaller. Therefore, for the same object, it will often result in different descriptors because of the different densities. As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1.1 Our Proposed Adapted PFH-based Descriptors ‣ 3.1 Traditional Versus Learning-based Descriptors ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the relative angle is very robust to point density because the relative angle will remain the same if the density or scale of the point clouds changes. We have illustrated the density robustness in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1.1 Our Proposed Adapted PFH-based Descriptors ‣ 3.1 Traditional Versus Learning-based Descriptors ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. And for both the indoor and outdoor scenes, the relative angles will not change with respect to the point density. More specifically, as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1.1 Our Proposed Adapted PFH-based Descriptors ‣ 3.1 Traditional Versus Learning-based Descriptors ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we denote the same point on the geometry for the dense point clouds chair and the sparse point clouds chair as <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐴</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.2.m2.1c">A_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.2">𝐴</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.3.m3.1c">A_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>, and the same goes for other points such as <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">B</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.2">𝐵</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1c">B_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml">B</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.2">𝐵</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.5.m5.1c">B_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>, et al.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our adapted PFH-based feature is robust to random noise because the random noise merely results in the change in point distance. And the point distance is not considered in our adapted PFH-based feature. Also, according to our experiments, the random noise existing in our tested datasets will not have great influence on the final point clouds understanding for the fact that the noise model depends on the sensor. The same RGB-D camera or LiDAR have the same noise model. Also, in our setting for all datasets, the noise model remains the same in the training set and the testing set. Also, due to that our proposed RM3D is a representation learning-based model, the noise robustness of our approach is better as compared with traditional approaches. Also, it is demonstrated extensively by recent works in point clouds learning that representation learning-based model is very robust to noises and corruptions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">ren2022benchmarking</span> </a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">ye2021learning</span> </a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2019relation</span> </a></cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In this Subsection, we do a comprehensive review of the traditional descriptors. We have also done experiments with many other traditional descriptors. The short illustrations of various of descriptors are summarized as follows.


<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SHOT</span>
The Signature of Histogram (SHOT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">salti2014shot</span> </a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">tombari2010unique</span> </a></cite> is also a popular 3D descriptor. The procedure of obtaining the SHOT descriptor can be summarized as follows: First of all, we need to divide the space into several small volumes. Secondly, we need to compute the local histogram of each volume. Thirdly, we need to concatenate the local histograms into a ”signature”. It should be noted that with the local reference frame (LRF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">salti2014shot</span> </a></cite>, the signature is 6D pose invariant. Finally, we should normalize the ”signature” into the sum of one. The major drawback of SHOT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">salti2014shot</span> </a></cite> 3D descriptor is the boundary effect. The boundary effect is that points at the edge of each volume should contribute to the neighbouring volume as well. And small perturbations of local reference frame change all the local histograms.

We have also done experiments with the FPFH. There are some major differences between the FPFH and PFH. Firstly, the FPFH descriptor has partial connected neighbors, while the PFH descriptor has fully connected neighbors. And the FPFH has partial connected neighbours.

Similar to PFH, the HKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">sun2009concise</span> </a></cite> is also a point signature based on the properties of the heat diffusion process on a 3D shape. The HKS is an extension of the well known heat kernel to the temporal domain. The biggest advantage is that HKS can capture information about the neighbourhood of a point in a multi-scale way. While the disadvantage of it is also the high-computational cost.

The wave kernel signature is very distinctive for the fact that it represents the average probability of the quantum particle appearing at a specific location. By varying energy, WKS separates information from different Laplace frequencies. It is demonstrated by our experiments that WKS can also be integrated seamlessly with our proposed learning-based WSL 3D scene understanding framework. Also, The WKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">aubry2011wave</span> </a></cite> is invariant to isometries and very robust to small non-isometric deformations compared with HKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">sun2009concise</span> </a></cite>.

The biggest advantage of SIKS is that it can maintain the invariance under various transformations the shape experienced. It is very robust to various of transformations such as the isometric deformations, the missing of data, the topological noises, and also the global or local scale change. Also, the biggest disadvantage is that the computation is very slow trained with this kind of descriptor.

The main ideas are that if the two 3D models are similar, they also look similar in different viewing angles.

In this work, we propose a simple but effective learning-based descriptor which can outperform traditional descriptors and achieve superior performance in a single dataset without any transfer learning. Note that according to our experiments, although the learning-based descriptor can realize superior performance on a single dataset, the transfer learning performance is not that good, which also demonstrate the generalization capacity of current learning-based descriptors should be improved. And the traditional descriptors have the advantage of great generalization capacity across domains . It is demonstrated in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 4.4.2 Instance Segmentation ‣ 4.4 Results of WSL for 3D Semantic/Instance Segmentation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> the transfer learning performance of our adapted PFH is better compared with Predator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">huang2021predator</span> </a></cite> in the indoor transfer learning between S3DIS and ScanNet.

For the optimization in contrastive learning, we have leveraged triplet contrastive loss instead of the original contrastive loss for the fact that the original contrastive loss is too greedy. It merely aims at minimizing the distances between positive samples and maximizing the distance between negative samples. Therefore, the original contrastive loss can be easily trapped into a local minimum during network training. According to our experimental results, our proposed simple contrastive learning-based descriptor can be integrated into our framework with SOTAs 3D scene understanding performance.

<br class="ltx_break">After the network is trained, the network gives a distinctive descriptor to describe different local 3D point cloud patches. The 3D local descriptor also serves for the following cluster-level region merging based on local similarities.</p>

In this way, the model is able to decode the latent representation into the characteristics of each point to predict which points are prominent and located in the overlapping region of the two point clouds in terms of the respective other point cloud.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, in this Subsection, we detail the procedure of self-training-based instance segmentation. The instance segmentation branch is different from the semantic segmentation branch for the fact that clustering should be done to segment each instance and the offset of each point should be learnt. In this work, we develop a weakly supervised framework to do instance segmentation. Our framework is generally similar to the fully supervised instance segmentation framework PointGroup. However, we have proposed several designs to make the original framework suitable for weakly supervised instance segmentation in the limited annotation setting. Different from the previous self-training, we use confidence threshold to ensure these high-confidence regions are given pseudo labels during region merging with self-training. The procedures are shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.1.2 Other Traditional Descriptors ‣ 3.1 Traditional Versus Learning-based Descriptors ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> as detailed as follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed region merging strategies for segmentation is composed of two parts. The first part is the region-level similarity prediction strategy, and the second part is the learning-based region merging. The two parts are detailed as follows: 
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">The Region-Level Similarity Prediction Strategy</span>
We have proposed a learning-based region merging method based on the affinity provided by both the traditional and learning-based 3D descriptors. We first use the PFH-based oversegmentation to obtain regions. The oversegmentation procedure is provided in the Appendix. After the oversegmentation, we can obtain the initial geometrically separated regions. Some randomly selected oversegmentation results are shown in the second column of Figure <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.3 Proposed Region Merging Strategies for Segmentation ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. It is apparent that our adapted PFH-based oversegmentation results can automatically divide the whole point clouds scene into geometrically well-separated regions, which are indicated by different colors. After the point clouds oversegmentation, we also obtain the original pseudo labels by expanding each labeled point to all the points in the region that includes the labeled point. For the regions containing more than one label point, we directly use the semantic of the maximum number of points as the inital pseudo label for the region. If two classes have the same number of labeled points, we have the priority for assigning the class that has larger number of points in the training set. Most importantly, in this Subsection, we propose an end-to-end approach to incorporate the traditional or learnt 3D local descriptors mentioned above for learning-based region merging.</p>

The final column shows the ground truth instance segmentation results, which are not available in weakly supervised learning.

Note that merely valid regions with highly confident cluster-level predictions are used as pseudo labels during self-training. Compared with the original PFH-based approach and the voxel connectivity-based approach, our adapted PFH-based and contrastive learning-based approach can both provide more homogeneous and consistent region merging results. Also, it can be demonstrated that the region merging results of the original PFH-based 3D descriptor is not that good because it takes the point distance into consideration. The final semantic segmentation mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and instance segmentation Average Precision (AP@50%) are also comprehensively reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, respectively. It can be demonstrated that both our adapted PFH-based and contrastive learning-based approaches show superior performance.</figcaption>

It is desired that a region merging submodule should be proposed to merge or divide clusters in a learnable way. In our design, the predicted semantic/instance of the learnable network and the 3D traditional or learnt 3D descriptor of clusters jointly decide a similarity score, indicating whether neighbouring clusters should be merged. In 2D computer vision, the idea of using geometric feature to serve as local descriptors for object detection has been proposed. In our work, we have incorporated the 3D local descriptor into consideration to evaluate the local geometric similarities.

We have shown the oversegmentation results of our adapted PFH-based approach and our proposed contrastive learning-based approach compared with the original PFH-based approach. Note that merely valid regions with highly confident cluster-level predictions are used as pseudo labels during self-training. Compared with the original PFH-based approach, both our adapted PFH-based and contrastive learning-based 3D local description approaches can provide more homogeneous and consistent region merging results. The final instance segmentation performance of SemanticKITTI is reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

The <span id="S3.SS3.p11.20.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">KL</span> divergence is universally adopted to evaluate the difference between two probabilistic distributions. In our work, we utilize the <span id="S3.SS3.p11.20.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">JS</span> divergence instead because of its symmetry property, which means it remains constant when two distributions are very distant to each other. Also, the distributional loss for regression such as the JS divergence is easier to optimize with improved gradient and reduces the overfitting problem compared with the mean square error (MSE)-based loss. It is also demonstrated by experiments that the JS divergence outperforms traditional mean square error-based loss in downstream scene understanding tasks. The final <span id="S3.SS3.p11.20.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">JS</span> Divergence Loss for semantic segmentation is formulated as:</p>

Note that for the object detection, our method operates in an unsupervised manner for doing instance segmentation, followed by our regression submodule to realize object detection.

In this way, object presence within a scene can serve as the supervision for similarity predictions among regions benefiting from the self-supervision provided by scene object classes.

Object detection can take advantage of the supervision from instance segmentation because object proposals can be directly obtained from the results of the instance segmentation. The axis tightly aligned bounding box of each instance provided by the results of instance segmentation is selected as the initialization of pseudo ground truth bounding boxes for object detection.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">We adopt the self-training strategy, therefore, the training of the network requires several iterations. As is illustrated in Subsection <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS1" title="3.2.1 Baseline for self-training-based instance segmentation ‣ 3.2 Revisit Baseline Framework of Self-Training ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2.1</span></a>, our self-training is a little different from the traditional manners. More specifically, we have shown results of cluster-level region merging in Figure <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.3 Proposed Region Merging Strategies for Segmentation ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 3.3 Proposed Region Merging Strategies for Segmentation ‣ 3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

In our work, the {20, 50, 100, 200} labeled points represent the labeled points per scene. We adopt the random selection of label points and ensure that at least one point is selected for each class. In our experiments, we keep the same label points percentage (e.g. number of labeled points per scene) for various of compared methods, thus guaranteeing the fairness of comparisons. The random labeling scheme adopted by us is the most efficient and common data labeling scheme of point clouds in 3D WSL. In practice, there is no unified solution to obtain the certain portion of label points, as long as the labeling strategy is efficient enough. All our experiments have been done three times, and the average results are given. Although with randomly sampled label points, we still outperform all compared SOTAs methods such as the ReDAL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">wu2021redal</span> </a></cite> with active learning.

In the first few training iterations, the quality of labels is low, we choose to firstly believe more in the traditional or learnt local 3D descriptor-based features <math id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{color,i,j}}}}},M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{scale,i,j}}}}}," display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="71%" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3a.cmml">color,i,j</mtext></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">M</mi><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="71%" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3a.cmml">scale,i,j</mtext></msub></mrow><mo id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.2">,</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><list id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2"><apply id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="50%" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3">color,i,j</mtext></ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3a.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="50%" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.3">scale,i,j</mtext></ci></apply></list></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{color,i,j}}}}},M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{scale,i,j}}}}},</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{des,i,j}}}}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="71%" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml">des,i,j</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" mathsize="50%" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3">des,i,j</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1c">M_{\mbox{{\tiny{{des,i,j}}}}}</annotation></semantics></math> to do the region merging.

In this Subsection, we have given a very comprehensive comparisons of the performance of different local descriptors not only on the task of over-segmentation, but also on the task of final semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. First of all, we compare different methods on the task of over-segmentation. To test the rotational robustness of various 3D local descriptors, we have done detailed experiments for the original scene and the rotated scene respectively.

The experimental results of instance segmentation are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The left of ’/’ shows the performances for the original scene, and the right of ’/’ shows the performances for the rotated scene. It can be seen that the above illustrated 3D descriptors can be integrated seamlessly to our proposed weakly supervised learning framework to fulfill the tasks of 3D scene understanding. According to our experimental results, the visual similarity based 3D descriptor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">chen2003visual</span> </a></cite> has poor performance in the tasks of oversegmentation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. It can be explained by the fact that the visual similarities of the 3D structures from diverse angles can be not that similar, and it results in poor local geometrical description capacity and rotation robustness. Also, the signature based approaches including HKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">sun2009concise</span> </a></cite> and WKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">aubry2011wave</span> </a></cite> are also not very robust to rotation because they do not explicitly consider rotational robustness in their formulations. The HKS (Heat Kernel Signiture) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">sun2009concise</span> </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">gebal2009shape</span> </a></cite> utilizes the heat diffusion process to capture the extreme surface change.

The performances of SIKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">bronstein2010scale</span> </a></cite> for the tasks of oversegmentation, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation are marginally better than HKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">sun2009concise</span> </a></cite> for its effective scale invariant heat kernel signature designs. The SIKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">bronstein2010scale</span> </a></cite> is a scale-invariant version of HKS that can maintain invariance under a wide range of transformations the shape undergoes, therefore, the semantic segmentation and instance segmentation performances of SIKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">bronstein2010scale</span> </a></cite> are maintained even if randomly rotated. WKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">aubry2011wave</span> </a></cite> embeds and separates information from diverse Laplacian eigen frequencies by varying the energy of the quantum mechanical particle. The WKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">aubry2011wave</span> </a></cite> is invariant to isometries and very robust to small non-isometric deformations compared with HKS. Also, for the fact that WKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">aubry2011wave</span> </a></cite> permits access even to very high frequency information, it results in marginally better local description capacity and provides more accurate local matching and registration than the HKS. Our experimental results also demonstrates the effectiveness of WKS compared with HKS. The results of oversegmentation and 3D scene segmentation of WKS is comparable to SIKS as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, according to our experimental results shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, our proposed simple contrastive learning-based 3D descriptor has outperformed the typical learning-based descriptors such as Point-SIFT and S-SPG in the tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and oversegmentation. The success of the constrative learning-based local descriptor can be ascribed to the fact that contrastive learning has the capacity of capturing very discriminative feature representations of the local 3D geometry in an unsupervised manner. Compared with other learning-based 3D descriptors such as Point-SIFT, and S-SPG mentioned in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Proposed Methodology ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the discrimination of the positive and negative samples in the contrastive learning can be realized in a clearer way, thus resulting in a slightly better result. We have also compared our contrastive learning-based local 3D descriptor with a recently proposed 3D descriptor Predator, which is specially designed for registering point cloud scans with a low overlap. It can be demonstrated that our proposed simple contrastive learning-based 3D descriptor can achieve a slightly inferior and sometimes comparable performance compared with the Predator, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our 3D descriptor design. Also, the rotational robustness of our proposed contrastive learning-based 3D descriptor can sometimes be even better than the Predator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">huang2021predator</span> </a></cite>, which can be explained by the fact that the contrastive learning has inherently guaranteed the rotational robustness because the selection of the positive and the negative samples is agnostic to viewing angles. In summary, it can be demonstrated from Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Quality of the Produced Pseudo Label by RM3D ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> that our proposed framework can be integrated seamlessly with various of traditional or learnt 3D descriptors to achieve 3D scene understanding. Also, our proposed adapted PFH-based 3D descriptor and contrastive learning-based 3D descriptor have satisfactory performance for the oversegmentation and instance segmentation tasks in 3D scene understanding. It is validated by experiments that our adapted PFH-based 3D descriptor and proposed contrastive learning-based 3D descriptor also have good rotational robustness. The performance will not drop much even if the random rotation of <math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0^{\circ}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">∘</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">0</cn><compose id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"></compose></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">0^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="180^{\circ}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><msup id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">180</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">∘</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">180</cn><compose id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3"></compose></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">180^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math> is applied.</p>

The graph-based label propagation is resembled in it based on the spatial and color smoothness constraints. The spatial and color smoothness are utilized for contrasting between diverse regions (OTOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">liu2021one</span> </a></cite>) and points (Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xu2020weakly</span> </a></cite>). While our method directly utilizes both the 3D descriptors and high-level semantics for region merging rather than contrasting.

Finally, the performance of our approach also outperforms Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xu2020weakly</span> </a></cite>, Viewpoint-Bottleneck, and pre-training-based approached such as ContrastiveSceneContext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">hou2021exploring</span> </a></cite> and PointContrast <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">xie2020pointcontrast</span> </a></cite> under diverse labeling budget such as 0.2% labels, one point label, and 1.0% label. On ScanNet validation set, our method has the best performance across various of objects ranging from objects spreading across a long spatial range such as the wall, and the local objects such as the bed. The experimental results prove that our method can not only capture the spatial long-range dependencies, but also the local geometric features.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the methods merely designed for semantic segmentation, we have integrated those methods with the PointGroup backbone for instance segmentation, and with Votenet backbone for object detection as our proposed approach. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3 A Comprehensive Comparison on the Results of Traditional and our Proposed Learnt 3D Descriptors ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A Review and A Robust Framework of Data-Efficient 3D Scene Parsing with Traditional/Learned 3D Descriptors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, our framework <span id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ranks first</span> in the task of instance segmentation with limited annotations. The better performance has been achieved in small object-level semantic categories such as bookshelf and bed for ScanNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">dai2017scannet</span> </a></cite> instance segmentation. For the overall performance, our method outperforms current art ReDAL by 1.5% when there are 0.2% labeled points. For the fine-grained object classes such as the bed and the bookshelf, our proposed approach also outperforms existing 3D WSL approaches such as PSD by a margin, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

It turns out that our method ranks first in the instance segmentation with limited labeled points, outperforms current weakly supervised SOTA ContrastiveSceneContext by a great margin of at least 10%, which demonstrates the superior performance of our framework. We have also tested our method in a complete unsupervised manner. We still reach AP of 46.8% in the AP 50% scenario for ScanNet, which demonstrates our hypothesis that the our instance segmentation results are accurate enough to instruct and provide supervision for the object detection.</p>

<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S4.SS7.SSS1.p2.9.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ablation Analyses</span> The experimental results show that our proposed adapted PFH-based 3D local feature descriptor plays a significant role in the performance of the whole network. The adapted PFH-based feature descriptor is of great significance in the cluster-level similarity prediction strategy. It is more powerful than the other low-level features such as the color, the scale, and the normal feature for the task of semantic/instance segmentation and for the task of object detection. It demonstrates that PFH is still a very powerful local feature descriptor in the deep learning area. And when combining the low-level geometric PFH feature with the learnt high-level semantic features, the best performance can be achieved. It can be interpreted by the hypothesis that the neural network will inevitably overlook some low level geometric details, which can be exactly captured by the PFH-based local descriptors. The future work includes designing a fusion mechanism for the adapted PFH feature and learnt high-level semantic feature in a better way for better fulfilling the task of 3D scene understanding. Further, it can be demonstrated that the weight balancing strategy can also boost the weakly supervised 3D scene understanding performance on multiple tasks.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, we have conducted a comprehensive algorithm comparison of the traditional and learning-based 3D descriptors in the tasks of over-segmentation and downstream weakly-supervised 3D scene understanding. Based on that, we have proposed a general benchmark framework for weakly supervised point clouds understanding which has superior performance for the three most significant semantic understanding tasks including 3D semantic segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, and 3D object detection. Our proposed framework can be integrated seamlessly with diverse 3D descriptors to realize downstream 3D scene understanding tasks. The proposed network learns to merge over-divided regions based on the local geometric property similarities and the learnt feature similarities. Network modules are proposed to fully investigate the relations among semantics/geometric relationships within a scene, thus, high-quality pseudo labels can be generated from weak labels to provide a better segmentation supervision. The effectiveness of our approach is verified across diverse large-scale real-scene point clouds understanding benchmarks under various test circumstances with excellent rotational robustness.</p>
