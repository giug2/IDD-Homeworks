<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a privacy-preserving and distributed training method using heterogeneous data sets stored at local devices. Federated learning over wireless networks requires aggregating locally computed gradients at a server where the mobile devices send statistically distinct gradient information over heterogenous communication links. This paper proposes a Bayesian federated learning (BFL) algorithm to aggregate the heterogeneous quantized gradient information optimally in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). The idea of BFL is to aggregate the one-bit quantized local gradients at the server by jointly exploiting i) the prior distributions of the local gradients, ii) the gradient quantizer function, and iii) channel distributions. Implementing BFL requires high communication and computational costs as the number of mobile devices increases. To address this challenge, we also present an efficient modified BFL algorithm called scalable-BFL (SBFL). In SBFL, we assume a simplified distribution on the local gradient. Each mobile device sends its one-bit quantized local gradient together with two scalar parameters representing this distribution. The server then aggregates the noisy and faded quantized gradients to minimize the MSE. We provide a convergence analysis of SBFL for a class of non-convex loss functions. Our analysis elucidates how the parameters of communication channels and the gradient priors affect convergence. From simulations, we demonstrate that SBFL considerably outperforms the conventional sign stochastic gradient descent algorithm when training and testing neural networks using MNIST data sets over heterogeneous wireless networks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a decentralized approach to train machine learning models at a server using distributed and heterogeneous training data sets placed at mobile devices, without sharing raw data with a server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This machine learning approach has received considerable attention from the research community and industries because of the myriad of applications that require the privacy of user-generated data, such as activity on mobile phones. Federated learning performs distributed model training iteratively with two operations: 1) model optimization with local data sets, and 2) model aggregation, i.e., model averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In every round, the server sends a global model to a set of available mobile devices. Each device optimizes the model with locally available data and then sends its updated model parameters (or updated local gradient) to the server via communication links. The server updates the global model by averaging the local models or gradients received from the mobile devices and shares it in the next iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Optimizing a global model using local data sets placed at a massive number of mobile devices is a challenging task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The primary challenge is the high communication cost when updating the local computations from the mobile devices and the server. The communication cost is proportional to both the size of the global model parameters and the number of mobile devices connected to the server. The model size is typically tens of millions when training complex neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and the number of mobile devices can be a few hundred and more depending on applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. When sending locally computed model parameters simultaneously over wireless links, the server cannot decode them all successfully under a limited bandwidth constraint.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lossy compression of local gradients is a practical solution to reduce the size of the message per communication round. Compression can be performed via sparsification, or quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. One popular approach of gradient sparsification is to send the top-<math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> magnitude coordinates of a local gradient vector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. An alternative approach is to use optimal vector quantization methods that minimize quantization error <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Such approaches may be challenging to implement in practice. Scalar quantization techniques are very popular due to their simplicity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In particular, one-bit gradient quantization with sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has been studied extensively in the recent literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Notwithstanding significant progress in improving communication efficiency by compression, prior work did not consider aggregation of local gradients by jointly embracing heterogeneous local data distributions, varying communication link reliabilities per device, and quantization effects. Most prior works mainly focus on a separate communication and learning system design approach – decoding the local gradients and aggregating them independently. Under the premise that the local gradients sent by the mobile devices are perfectly decodable at the server using proper modulation and coding techniques per link, simple gradient aggregation methods (e.g., gradient-averaging or model-averaging) have been considered. For example, when receiving faded and noisy versions of one-bit local gradients from mobile devices, the most popular method to aggregate the signs of the gradients is simple majority voting in signSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. One drawback of this strategy is that it fails to achieve the optimal performance in detecting the sign of the sum of one-bit gradients when the distributions of the local gradients and the communication links’ qualities are not identical across mobile devices. Another drawback of this separate design approach is that the server must perform at least as many decoding operations as the number of devices sending the local gradients before aggregation, which may give rise to a significant delay in federated learning systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air aggregation is a new paradigm to jointly design the communication and learning system by harnessing the superposition nature of the wireless medium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Although this approach opens new opportunities in designing the wireless and learning system jointly, it is limited to time division duplex wireless systems, in which channel state information is available at the mobile devices for uplink transmissions. In current frequency-division-duplexing LTE systems, orthogonalized multiple access such as narrowband IoT may be preferred in implementing federated learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, where each mobile device performs uplink transmission using orthogonal subcarriers.</p>

The key innovation of the proposed algorithm is to jointly exploit 1) the joint distribution of local gradients, 2) the one-bit quantizer function for gradient compression, and 3) the distributions of communication channels when aggregating the quantized local gradients. Under the premise that the prior distributions of the local gradients are jointly Gaussian, this aggregation method is optimal in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) per communication round. In practice, the MSE-optimal aggregation method may be difficult to implement due to the lack of knowledge about the joint distribution of local gradients and additional communication costs.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present an efficient algorithm referred to as scalable-BFL (SBFL) to resolve the practical challenges in BFL. In SBFL we use 1) a simple prior distribution model for the local gradient and 2) a sub-optimal Bayesian aggregation function. Specifically, we model each local gradient vector’s prior distribution as a simple independent identically distributed (iid) Gaussian or Laplacian in which the mean and variances are estimated in every round. Instead of finding the MSE-optimal aggregation function that requires knowledge of joint distribution of the priors and involves multi-dimensional integrations, we use a computationally-efficient Bayesian aggregation function in closed-form, which achieves the minimum MSE under an iid Gaussian prior. Interestingly, the proposed function can be implemented with a shallow neural network using the hyperbolic tangent activation function. The shallow neural network parameters are determined by the standard deviation of the prior distribution, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of communication links, and channel fadings. Under the assumption of independent Gaussian prior, we also present the Bussgang-based linear minimum MSE (BLMMSE) aggregation method for SBFL and compare it with the proposed nonlinear MMSE aggregation function.</p>

The crucial step in our proof is to show that the proposed Bayesian aggregation function is the unbiased estimator of the sum of sign gradients, and the corresponding MSE is bounded by a constant per communication round. Then, under mild assumptions, we derive the convergence rate of SBFL to show how fast it decreases a loss function in terms of the number of iterations and the MSE. Our result shows that the SBFL algorithm ensures convergence to a stationary point of a non-convex and smooth loss function.</p>

First, we train a linear estimator for which the loss function is strongly convex with both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets. In such settings, we demonstrate that SBFL results in lower training loss than signSGD for both datasets. Then, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) over the MNIST dataset to verify the performance gain in a deep FL setup. We demonstrate that SBFL improves the accuracy of the trained model when using heterogeneous data sets in wireless networks. The gain of SBFL results from the exploitation of side-information including both the (approximate) prior distribution of local gradients and heterogeneous channel distributions when aggregating the gradient information per communication round. From simulations, we verify that this gain is attainable when training convex and non-convex loss functions with different data settings.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a framework for BFL. The motivation of BFL is to find an optimal aggregation method of local gradients from a Bayesian viewpoint. The majority-voting based aggregation is effective in detecting the sign of the sum of the one-bit local gradients when the SNRs and fadings are identical across mobile devices. In heterogenous wireless networks, however, this majority-voting based aggregation cannot be optimal in detecting the sign of the local gradients’ sum due to the distinct reliabilities of the communication links. In addition, to enhance the FL performance, the server may require to accurately know the sum of local gradients rather than the sum of the local gradients’ signs. Motivated by these facts, we aim at finding an optimal aggregation method of the local gradients in the sense of minimizing MSE. The key idea of BFL is to aggregate local gradients per iteration by jointly harnessing the knowledge of 1) the prior distributions of local gradients, 2) the gradient quantizer function, and 3) the likelihood functions of the communication channels.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This proposition shows that the BLMMSE aggregation function is also scalable to the number of mobile devices and the model size because it requires element-wise operation. However, this aggregation function is worse than the MMSE aggregation function in terms of the MSE performance because it minimizes the MSE under a linear map constraint.</p>

Thereby, the server requires compressing the real-valued model parameter to reduce the downlink communication cost. To accomplish this, we can modify the proposed SBFL. Instead of performing the model update at the server, we can compress the aggregated local gradients to a binary vector, and send the compressed sign information to mobile devices via downlink channels. Using the received binary information, each mobile device independently updates the model parameters using the same learning rate. This algorithm modification can significantly reduce the downlink communication cost because it sends a binary vector using the downlink channel per communication round. We summarize this in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="In IV-B4 Extension with downlink compression ‣ IV-B Special Case and Generalizations ‣ IV Scalable Bayesian Federated Learning ‣ Bayesian Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a convergence analysis of SBFL for a class of convex loss functions. The critical step in the analysis is to derive that MSE values according to different gradient aggregation functions. Then, leveraging the derived MSE values, we show that the gradient descent algorithm employing the proposed aggregation method guarantees convergence to a stationary point for a class of non-convex loss functions.</p>

We first explain the simulation settings, including a network model, channel models, and data distributions. We then provide numerical examples that show the learning performance of the SBFL algorithm in two different scenarios. We begin with a simple federated learning setting in which a linear classifier is optimized with synthetic yet heterogeneous data sets across users, each with distinct communication link qualities. Then, we consider a more complicated setup, in which a CNN is trained using MNIST datasets allocated to users in a heterogeneous manner.</p>

Then, each user uniformly selects two chunks from distinct classes of the MNIST dataset in a non-overlapping manner, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Bayesian Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

In contrast, the sign SGD algorithm requires 638 communication rounds to meet the same level of test accuracy. Therefore, our learning algorithm approximately reduces the communication rounds by a factor of five. Meanwhile, SBFL with Laplacian prior takes more communication rounds than the Gaussian prior, which can be explained by the prior distribution model’s mismatch effect with the true prior distribution.</p>

As can be seen, the proposed one provides significant gains compared to the signSGD algorithm in both the loss and accuracy. The proposed algorithm speeds up the convergence rates, saving communication costs for federated learning systems. Besides, SBFL with both prior distributions reduces the variance of training loss and test accuracy. This shows that SBFL can take advantage when aggregating the local gradients by jointly harnessing the link quality’s heterogeneities and the prior distributions, even for optimizing a non-convex loss function.</p>

To fairly compare the proposed algorithm with the benchmark signSGD, which only requires to send the binary sign vector in the downlink communication per round, element-wise sign quantization is applied on the downlink compression for each method. In this case, we observe that SBFL with downlink compression outperforms the corresponding signSGD algorithm in terms of test accuracy for various learning rates and weight parameters. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-C2 MNIST dataset ‣ VI-C Learning Performance Comparison ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Bayesian Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, one interesting observation is that the test accuracy gain improves more than that of the case without the downlink compression. This elucidates that the proposed algorithm is robust to downlink compression; thereby, it is promising for wireless federated learning systems even when the downlink channel capacity is limited.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposed a new Bayesian approach for federated learning over heterogeneous wireless networks, called BFL, and its communication-and-computation efficient variation, SBFL. We demonstrated that SBFL improves the training loss and test accuracy performance compared to signSGD with heterogeneous data and distinct wireless link qualities across mobile devices. These performance gains are attainable by jointly harnessing the side-information on the users’ local gradient priors and the channel distributions, facilitating aggregation of the local gradients more accurately per communication round. We showed that for non-convex and smooth objectives, the models trained using SBFL with heterogeneous datasets converge to the optimal value. In simulations, we also demonstrated the ability of SBFL to learn complicated convolutional network models more accurately than signSGD when using non-synthetic datasets.</p>
