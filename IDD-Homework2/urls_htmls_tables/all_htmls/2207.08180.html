<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning has been introduced as a new machine learning paradigm enhancing the use of local devices. At a server level, FL regularly aggregates models learned locally on distributed clients to obtain a more general model. In this way, no private data is sent over the network, and the communication cost is reduced. However, current solutions rely on the availability of large amounts of stored data at the client side in order to fine-tune the models sent by the server. Such setting is not realistic in mobile pervasive computing where data storage must be kept low and data characteristic (distribution) can change dramatically. To account for this variability, a solution is to use the data regularly collected by the client to progressively adapt the received model. But such naive approach exposes clients to the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate this problem in the mobile human activity recognition context on smartphones.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pervasive computing promotes the integration of smart devices in our living spaces to develop services providing assistance to people <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>. For a decade, we have seen the emergence of smarter services based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. ML enables the production of highly performing decision systems by identifying patterns that may be hidden within massive data sets whose exact nature is unknown and therefore cannot be programmed explicitly. However, bringing such services into production raises a number of difficult issues. Current solutions rely on complex distributed architectures, integrating devices, edge, and cloud infrastructure. Simply put, learning models are built in the cloud using historical data, then deployed and executed on devices, or on the nearest edge resources. If possible, additional data is regularly collected by the devices and sent up to the cloud in order to build more up-to-date models. Such an approach, however, undergoes major limitations in terms of security (data sent over unprotected networks), performance (high volume of data), and cost related to communication and also models retraining (especially when using deep learning).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) was recently proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">2</span></a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">12</span></a>]</cite> as a new learning paradigm promoting the execution and specialization of models on devices, called clients. At one point, clients models are sent to a server where they are aggregated into a more generic one. This new model is redistributed to the clients for a new local learning iteration, and so on. Federated Learning reduces communication costs and improves security because only models, and no private data, are exchanged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">25</span></a>]</cite>. It has immediately attracted attention in the pervasive field but it rapidly appeared that adaptations were needed to meet specific challenges of this domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>]</cite>. Originally, Federated Learning was set out as an alternative form of distributed learning to obtain a single well-performing model (on the server side) without ever communicating user data. However, to deal with pervasive computing, this learning approach should shift from a single server-centric model to a multi client-centric model objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">22</span></a>]</cite>. Precisely, client models should perform well on local data (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">strong personalization</em>) as well as on data only seen by others (<em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">good generalization</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One particular thorny issue is when a client receives a new model from the server. This new model must be readjusted to the client in order to recover a good personalization, while preserving its recently obtained generalization. The solution commonly used today is to fine-tune (train) the received model with client data kept for this purpose. In practice, this requires a carefully selected set of representative training data to obtain satisfactory performances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>]</cite>. However, such setting is not realistic in mobile pervasive computing where data storage must be kept low and data characteristic (distribution) can change dramatically. To account for this variability, a solution is to use the data regularly collected by the client to progressively adapt the received model. But such naive approach exposes clients to the problem of <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">catastrophic forgetting</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">19</span></a>]</cite>, which appears when a neural network is optimized on new data that are too different from the data previously used for training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This is related to a more general neural network problem known as the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stability-plasticity</span> dilemma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">16</span></a>]</cite>, where plasticity and stability refer to integrating new knowledge and retaining previous knowledge respectively. Such dilemma is at the heart of the research area of Continual Learning (CL) also known as lifelong learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of this paper is to show that the problem of catastrophic forgetting is critical in a pervasive computing application using Federated Learning. It is demonstrated in the mobile Human Activity Recognition (HAR) domain. The paper is organized as it follows.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning promotes the computation of local models on devices and the aggregation of these models on a server to produce a new model that is sent back to clients for use and further training.
When the client model has been significantly updated or when a certain time has elapsed, the client model is sent to the server for a new aggregation (figure 1). A core incentive of FL in pervasive computing is to utilize mutual learning goals between clients to indirectly share knowledge with one another. However, effective collaboration between unmoderated clients, is still a challenge. This is due to statistical heterogeneity (differences in individuals’ usage) and system heterogeneity (difference between client data caused by different system traits).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A number of studies have proposed intricate methods to mitigate the detrimental effects of heterogeneity. Specifically, we have identified methods such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">23</span></a>]</cite> and FSVRG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">20</span></a>]</cite> which apply local model/gradient controlled learning that limits the divergence of clients. Another known method, as seen in FeSEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">34</span></a>]</cite> and MLMG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">29</span></a>]</cite> is to group clients or create more than one server model based on clients similarity.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A key point in FL is the way specialized models are aggregated. In the case of deep learning, two families of algorithms can be considered. The first strategy is to emphasize generalization. The aggregation algorithm considers local models in their entirety and builds a new model that potentially calls into question all layers and all weights associated with neurons. This approach is shown in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">27</span></a>]</cite> and FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">32</span></a>]</cite> algorithms. The second strategy focuses more on client specialization. Here, the algorithm does not question certain parts of the local models. Precisely, only the base layers are sent to the server for generalization, while the last layers are kept unchanged. This approach is used in FedPer algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">15</span></a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FL has been only recently used to implement pervasive services and, ultimately, does not address all the specifics of this domain well. The goal in pervasive computing, by contrast with the original FL, is to increase all individual clients performances, not only the server model performance. To do so, FL must account for the fact that data, even though in the same domain, might evolve very differently according to the clients. Also, mediation techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">21</span></a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">14</span></a>]</cite> could be integrated into the FL approach in order to align the data in a more homogeneous way.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continual Learning (CL), also called lifelong learning or online machine learning, is the ability of a model to learn continually from an infinite stream of data, gradually integrating new acquired knowledge into old knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>]</cite>.
Continual Learning highlights the sequential nature of the learning process. Formally, newly acquired data is passed to the model in the form of tasks. Tasks are made of labeled classes, uniquely identified and disjoint from each other, and a corresponding dataset. A model then learns sequences of tasks. At each training session, a model has only access to the current task (and possibly to some data kept from previous tasks), which is not accessible anymore after training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past few years, numerous works have proposed to deal with Continual Learning and avoid catastrophic forgetting. They can be divided into three families <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">26</span></a>]</cite>: <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">regularisation-based</span> methods, <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">exemplar-based</span> methods, and <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bias-correction</span> methods. Regularisation-based approaches minimize the impact of learning on the weights that are important for previous tasks. Among them, EWC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">19</span></a>]</cite> calculates the weights of model parameters with a Fisher Information Matrix, while PathInt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">13</span></a>]</cite> accumulates changes in each parameter during the learning process. RWalk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>]</cite> uses both
approaches complemented with exemplars to improve results. Other approaches use knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">5</span></a>]</cite> such as LwF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">24</span></a>]</cite> which trains a current model (student) with a past model as a teacher to prevent drifting while learning new tasks. The student model can also be guided using the attention of the teacher model as in LwM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">10</span></a>]</cite>.</p>

For instance, iCarl <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">30</span></a>]</cite>, selects exemplars by their feature space representation and performs classification based on a nearest-class-mean rule in that feature space. EEIL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">6</span></a>]</cite> uses an equal number of exemplars of all classes and a loss composed of a distillation measure to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, and a cross-entropy loss in order to learn the new classes.</p>

T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear technique for dimension reduction by minimizing the divergence between two distributions: a distribution that measures pairwise similarities in high-dimensional space and a distribution that measures pairwise similarities of the corresponding low-dimensional space. It allows to find patterns in the data by identifying observed clusters based on similarity of data points with multiple features. As t-SNE follows non-linearity, it can capture the structure of complex manifolds of higher-dimensional data and outperforms PCA, which is a linear feature extraction technique.</p>

Catastrophic forgetting has thus not only an effect on Client 1 but also on all the other clients.
We are convinced that this forgetting problem is a real problem that current FL techniques cannot avoid in pervasive computing when data is heterogeneous, devices have limited resources.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have highlighted in the Human Activity Recognition domain that the use of a Federated Learning does not avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. Even if some knowledge, coming for various clients, is retained at the server level, some tasks can be very quickly forgotten. This is due to the fact that some tasks are basically difficult to distinguish by a Neural Network (and they affect the same parts of a learning model). This is for example the case for movement activities in the HAR field.</p>
