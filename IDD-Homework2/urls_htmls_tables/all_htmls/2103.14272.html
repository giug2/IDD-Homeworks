<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a powerful distributed machine learning framework where a server aggregates models trained by different clients without accessing their private data. Hierarchical FL, with a client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can effectively leverage both the cloud server’s access to many clients’ data and the edge servers’ closeness to the clients to achieve a high communication efficiency. Neural network quantization can further reduce the communication overhead during model uploading. To fully exploit the advantages of hierarchical FL, an accurate convergence analysis with respect to the key system parameters is needed. Unfortunately, existing analysis is loose and does not consider model quantization. In this paper, we derive a tighter convergence bound for hierarchical FL with quantization. The convergence result leads to practical guidelines for important design problems such as the client-edge aggregation and edge-client association strategies. Based on the obtained analytical results, we optimize the two aggregation intervals and show that the client-edge aggregation interval should slowly decay while the edge-cloud aggregation interval needs to adapt to the ratio of the client-edge and edge-cloud propagation delay. Simulation results shall verify the design guidelines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation strategy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a promising and powerful training framework for privacy-preserving Deep Learning (DL), where clients train their models locally and then upload to a parameter server for model aggregation. This process is repeated for many rounds until the aggregated model at the server reaches a target accuracy. With FL, model training occurs at the clients and only the trained models are required to be aggregated at the server. This eliminates the need for sharing private user data and thus preserves data privacy. The feasibility of FL has been verified in real-world DL applications, e.g., the Google keyboard prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the long propagation delay, the increasing size of the DL models and limited resources make communication efficiency one of the most critical challenges in FL. Specifically, hundreds to thousands of rounds of communications may be required to reach a desired model accuracy. Furthermore, the overhead of one round of communication, including upload and download, is proportional to the model size, making it inefficient for employing large models, especially when the clients are connected to the server by wireless links.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most initial studies on FL assumed one cloud node as the parameter server, while some recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed to address the communication challenge by leveraging Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This transition led to Federated Edge Learning (FEL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which enables FL at the network edge to support ultra-low latency applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Although edge-based FL enjoys a lower round-trip latency, the number of clients that can participate in the training process is small, which degrades the training performance. Thus, a trade-off between the round-trip latency and learning performance exists when choosing between the cloud server and the edge server for the two-layer architecture.
This trade-off motivated a hierarchical architecture for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which includes one cloud server, multiple edge servers and many clients. There are two levels of aggregation in hierarchical FL, namely, the efficient and parallel edge aggregation and the time-consuming cloud aggregation. It was shown in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, both theoretically and empirically, that hierarchical FL achieves a faster convergence speed than the conventional two-layer cloud-based FL. Furthermore, empirical experiments showed that the hierarchical architecture reduces training time compared with the single-server architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Quantized message passing during the aggregation stage is another important technique to improve the communication efficiency and presents a similar communication-accuracy trade-off. The size of a full-precision model can be up to hundreds of megabytes for large DL models. By transmitting a low-precision approximate of the model, the communication cost can be greatly reduced. However, it is noted that an appropriate level of quantization can accelerate the training while a very coarse approximation will fail the training. Thus, model quantization shares a similar communication-accuracy trade-off as the hierarchical structure. As such, we shall investigate them together in this paper. Typical quantization techniques include low-rank approximation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and low-bit quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In the two-layer FL system, both theoretical analyses and experimental results have shown that quantization can significantly improve the communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, the associated analysis for hierarchical FL is not available yet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To fully exploit the potential of these communication-efficient techniques and architectures, we need an accurate convergence analysis based on which system optimization can be performed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. For example, when minimizing the communication cost in a FL system, a typical and critical question to ask is how to optimize the aggregation interval for a given training time budget <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math>. The solution of this problem highly depends on the variance term caused by the local steps in the derived convergence upper bound <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Thus, deriving tighter convergence bounds is of crucial importance not only to the theoretical understanding, but also to practical system design. There have been many recent efforts on this aspect, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, but the focus is on the server-based two-layer structure, and the investigation.
More importantly, the theoretical understanding of hierarchical FL is primitive. Existing analyses and system design for the hierarchical FL system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> were carried out assuming full-precision model updates, and the obtained convergence bound was loose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which made the optimization formulation inaccurate. The analysis developed in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has a complex expression and thus is difficult to be utilized for further system optimization. Thus, getting a sharp and tighter bound for hierarchical quantized FL is critical.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider a communication-efficient hierarchical FL system, where two levels of aggregation and quantization are adopted.

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The convergence of the two-layer FL has been well established for convex and non-convex loss functions in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the convergence of the FedAvg algorithm considering a random client selection strategy and model quantization was also investigated, where the communication cost is reduced with client partial participation and model quantization.
Recently, Federated Dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> was proposed. Such a method adopts a random model pruning approach, i.e., dropout, to reduce the local computation and communication cost. Clearly, this is another direction to improve the communication efficiency and can be combined with model quantization methods to further reduce the communication cost.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">System optimization is critical to improve the communication efficiency of the FL system. Current research for system design mainly focused on the following three aspects: spectrum allocation, power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and local aggregation interval control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In these works, the system design was formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the latency of the FL system subject to a given accuracy constraint.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The convergence analysis for hierarchical FL has been less well studied.

However, the optimizer at the client side is a full-batch gradient descent, which may not be practical for devices with a limited computation power. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors provided a convergence analysis of hierarchical FL for non-convex loss functions, where the obtained error bound is quadratic with the aggregation interval. Later, a tighter error bound was provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> for non-convex loss functions.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The overall communication cost in FL also depends on the DL model size, which determines the amount of data to be transmitted in each communication round. Quantization is often used to reduce the size of the model updates. A low-precision quantizer reduces the communication overhead but introduces additional noise during the training process, which will ultimately degrade the trained model performance. Thus, investigating the effect of quantization is important.</p>

A tighter analysis requires a novel approach since we need to focus on the evolution process of the local model parameter and carefully use inequalities to compute the upper bound. Besides, we do not require the gradient norm to be bounded, which is a relaxed assumption in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The lack of the uniformly bounded gradient norm assumption makes it difficult to bound the model parameter divergence in the evolution process.</p>

In this special case, Hier-Local-QSGD degrades to the conventional SGD. Note that this does not mean that the convergence will be the fastest in terms of wall clock time, as the communication latency is different for the edge side update and the cloud side update.

In FL, this independent and identical data (IID) assumption may not be satisfied. The extension to the non-IID case is non-trivial since the locally estimated gradient direction diversifies among different clients when they are performing local updates, and thus the aggregated gradient descent direction may not be the correct one. By replacing the weak assumption that gradient variance is upper bounded with a strict assumption that the gradient norm is bounded, a convergence result could be derived but the variance term is expected to be quadratic with respect to the local update steps. In this paper, we aim to derive a tighter bound which can be further utilized for system design, and thus, we have the IID assumption in Assumption <a href="#Thmassumption2" title="Assumption 2 (Variance of SGD) ‣ III Convergence Analysis ‣ Hierarchical Federated Learning with Quantization: Convergence Analysis and System Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The edge-client association is a unique resource allocation problem in Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning.
This problem has been discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> with a rough convergence analysis framework to capture the learning performance and to formulate a joint learning and resource allocation problem to accelerate training and save energy. Intuitively, it will be beneficial to the overall learning performance to have many devices connected to each edge server. However, for a given edge server with limited spectrum resources, when more clients are connected to the server, less bandwidth will be assigned to each client, which results in a longer communication delay. Thus, the learning performance and spectrum resource allocation are intertwined with each other, which makes the optimization problem different from the general computation offloading problem in the conventional MEC framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, by analyzing the convergence of the Hierarchical FL with the Hier-Local-QSGD algorithm, we find that, when the number of edge servers is fixed and each edge server is associated with at least one client, the convergence speed with respect to (w.r.t.) the iterations is irrelevant to the client-edge association strategy. Thus, to accelerate training of the overall system, we only need to minimize the communication delay for each aggregation. Due to the synchronization requirement in the Hier-Local-QSGD training algorithm at each aggregation step, the delay for each aggregation step is determined by the slowest client.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.3" class="ltx_p">It must be noted that a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> also analyzed the hierarchical local SGD algorithm for general non-convex loss functions. In their convergence result, it was found that the client-distribution will influence the final error bound in contrast to what we observed. This can be explained by the fact that different weight coefficients are used when averaging the updates from the edge to the cloud.

This result is very interesting and promising since infrequent communication and quantization are two important techniques to improve the communication efficiency in FL, but the communication reduction always comes at the price of slower convergence. Our results show both theoretically and experimentally that we can improve the communication efficiency without hurting the convergence speed under certain circumstances. However, it is also noted that the flipping threshold does not match the theoretical result when <math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{1}=\frac{n}{s}-1=4" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.2.cmml">q</mi><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.cmml"><mfrac id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.2.cmml">n</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.3.cmml">s</mi></mfrac><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.5" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.5.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.6" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.6.cmml">4</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1"><and id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1a.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1"></and><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1b.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.3"></eq><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.2">𝑞</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4"><minus id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.1"></minus><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2"><divide id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2"></divide><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.2.3">𝑠</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.3">1</cn></apply></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1c.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.5"></eq><share href="#S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.4.cmml" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1d.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1"></share><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1.1.6">4</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.9.m9.1c">q_{1}=\frac{n}{s}-1=4</annotation></semantics></math>.

Surprisingly, for this particular non-iid case, the edge-client association does not affect the performance. Our analysis cannot provide an explanation for this observation, and we empirically find that this conclusion does not generally hold for non-iid clients. Thus, it is interesting to characterize the conditions under which edge-client association does not have any impact on the training performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper developed a provably communication-efficient hierarchical FL algorithm and provided a tighter convergence analysis to support system design. The analysis in this paper improves the error term of local update from quadratic to linear, based on which two important design guidelines regarding the local update interval and the edge-client association were provided. Besides, an adaptive algorithm was developed to determine the two values of aggregation intervals. Simulations verified the design guidelines and demonstrated the effectiveness of the adaptive interval selection scheme. One limitation of the current analysis is that it focused on the IID-data, which leads to the conclusion that the edge-client association has no influence on the convergence speed. It would be interesting to extend the analysis of Hier-Local-QSGD to the non-IID case and further investigate the edge-client problem. In the future work, we also intend to consider the resource allocation problem based on the convergence analysis in realistic wireless FL systems, and considering practical heterogeneous clients.</p>
