<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel communication design, termed <em id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">random orthogonalization</em>, for federated learning (FL) in a massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. The key novelty of random orthogonalization comes from the tight coupling of FL and two unique characteristics of massive MIMO – channel hardening and favorable propagation. As a result, random orthogonalization can achieve natural over-the-air model aggregation without requiring transmitter side channel state information (CSI) for the uplink phase of FL, while significantly reducing the channel estimation overhead at the receiver. We extend this principle to the downlink communication phase and develop a simple but highly effective model broadcast method for FL. We also relax the massive MIMO assumption by proposing an enhanced random orthogonalization design for both uplink and downlink FL communications, that does not rely on channel hardening or favorable propagation. Theoretical analyses with respect to both communication and machine learning performance are carried out. In particular, an explicit relationship among the convergence rate, the number of clients, and the number of antennas is established. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of random orthogonalization for FL in massive MIMO.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) model communication is widely considered as one of the primary bottlenecks for federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This is because an FL task consists of multiple learning rounds, each of which requires uplink and downlink model exchanges between clients and the server. The limited communication resources in both uplink and downlink, combined with the detrimental effects from channel fading, noise, and interference, severely impact the <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">scalability</em> (in terms of the number of participating clients) of FL in a wireless communication system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One promising technique to tackle the scalability problem of FL over wireless communications is over-the-air computation (also known as AirComp); see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and the references therein. Instead of the standard approach of decoding the individual local models of each client and then aggregating, AirComp allows multiple clients to transmit uplink signals in a superpositioned fashion, and decodes the average global model directly at the FL server. In order to achieve this goal, a common approach is to “invert” the fading channel at each transmitter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, so that the sum model can be obtained at the server. AirComp has attracted considerable interest and a detailed literature review can be found in Section <a href="#S2" title="II Related Works ‣ Random Orthogonalization for Federated Learning in Massive MIMO Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, much of the existing work on AirComp has several limitations. First, these methods often require channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for each individual client. The process of enabling individual CSIT is complicated – in a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, this involves the receiver estimating the channels and then sending back the estimates to the transmitters; in a time division duplex (TDD) system, one can benefit from channel reciprocity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, but there is still a need for an independent pilot for each client. In both cases, practical mechanisms to obtain individual CSIT do not scale with the number of clients. In addition, the precision of CSIT is often worse than that of channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). Second, most AirComp approaches in the literature require a channel inversion-type power control, which is well known to “blow up” when at least one of the channels is experiencing deep fading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Third, AirComp approaches focus on improving the scalability and efficiency of the uplink communication phase in FL. How to address these challenges in the downlink communication phase remains underdeveloped.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another important limitation is that the AirComp solution does not naturally extend to multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems where the uplink and downlink channels become vectors. Compared with the studies in scalar channels, there are only a few recent papers that explore the potential of MIMO for wireless FL. MIMO beamforming design to optimize FL has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Coding, quantization, and compressive sensing over MIMO channels for FL have been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, none of these works tightly incorporates the unique properties of MIMO to the FL communication design. On the other hand, if we ignore the unique characteristics of FL, MIMO can also be utilized in a straightforward manner. In the uplink phase, we can use conventional MIMO estimators such as zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) to estimate each local model, and then compute the global model. In the downlink phase, we can design MIMO precoders to broadcast the global model. However, these approaches incur a large channel estimation overhead, especially when the channels have high dimensions. Moreover, matrix inversions in the ZF or MMSE estimators and the optimization algorithms for the precoding design are computationally demanding, in particular for massive MIMO. This increases the complexity and latency of the overall system. In addition, decoding individual local models also makes it easier for the server to sketch the data distribution of the clients, leading to potential privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims at designing simple-yet-effective FL communication methods that can efficiently address the scalability challenge in FL for both uplink and downlink phases. The novelty comes from a tight integration of MIMO and FL – our design explicitly utilizes the characteristics of both components. To illustrate the key idea, we start with <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">massive</em> MIMO where the base station (BS) has a large number of antennas. The proposed framework only requires the BS to estimate a <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">summation channel</em>, which significantly alleviates the burden on channel estimation<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>For example, a single pilot can be used by all clients as long as it is sent synchronously, regardless of the number of clients that participate in the current FL round.</span></span></span>. Moreover, our approach is agnostic to the number of clients, and thus improves the scalability of FL. By leveraging the unique channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of massive MIMO, the proposed principle, termed <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">random orthogonalization</em>, allows the BS to directly compute the global model via a simple linear projection operation, hence achieving extremely low complexity and low latency in the uplink communication phase. We then extend the random orthogonalization design to the downlink communication phase, which leads to a simple but highly effective model broadcast method for FL. As the random orthogonalization designs rely on channel hardening and favorable propagation to eliminate the interference, which do not always hold in practice (e.g., when the number of antennas is small), we further propose an <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">enhanced random orthogonalization</em> design for both uplink and downlink FL communications, that leverages <em id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">channel echos</em> to compensate for the lack of channel hardening and favorable propagation. The enhanced random orthogonalization design thus can be applied to a general MIMO system. To analyze the performances of random orthogonalization, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of the average model estimation errors as a theoretical benchmark. Moreover, taking both interference and noise into consideration, a novel convergence bound of FL is derived for the proposed methods over massive MIMO channels. Notably, we establish an explicit relationship among the convergence rate, the number of clients, and the number of antennas, which provides practical design guidance for wireless FL. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed random orthogonalization principle in a variety of FL and MIMO settings.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the key ideas of random orthogonalization. With this principle, the global model can be directly obtained at the BS via a simple operation in the uplink communications, and the global model can be broadcast to clients efficiently in the downlink communications. By exploring favorable propagation and channel hardening in massive MIMO, our proposed methods only require <em id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">partial</em> CSI, which significantly reduces the channel estimation overhead.</p>

Therefore, the proposed method is attractive in wireless FL due to its mild requirement of partial CSI.

Note that the analog aggregation method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> also uses “channel inversion” to pre-cancel channel fading. However, our design outperforms the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> because the latter requires full CSIT, which leads to a large channel estimation overhead even with channel reciprocity in a TDD system. On the contrary, our method only requires partial CSI, which can be efficiently obtained via channel echos. Moreover, analog aggregation does not naturally extend to MIMO systems when the uplink channels become vectors, which makes channel inversions at the transmitters nontrivial.</span></p>

CRLBs are the lower bounds on the variances of unbiased estimators, stating that the variance of any such estimator is at least as high as the inverse of the Fisher information (matrix). We have shown that the proposed methods lead to unbiased estimations of the global model in both uplink and downlink communications. Hence, we can use the sum of all diagonal elements of <math id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bf C}_{\hat{\bf x}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1a"><msub

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the performances of random orthogonalization and the enhanced method for uplink and downlink FL communications through numerical experiments. From a communication performance perspective, we compare the proposed methods with the classic MIMO estimators and precoders with respect to the MSE. We provide the computation time comparison as a measure of the complexity of various methods. We also discuss the robustness of the proposed methods when the properties of channel hardening and favorable propagation are not fully offered and the channel estimation is imperfect. We further verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods via FL tasks using real-world datasets.</p>

We can see that both random orthogonalization and the enhanced method behave almost identically as the ideal case where both uplink and downlink communications are perfect. Note that although the global model received at the BS has noise and interference components, the actual learning performances of the two methods do not deteriorate. Due to the model differential transmission in the uplink communications, the effective SINR of the received global model gradually increases as the model converges, despite the presence of channel interference and noise.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Leveraging the unique characteristics of channel hardening and favorable propagation in a massive MIMO system, we have proposed a novel uplink communication method, termed <em id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">random orthogonalization</em>, that significantly reduces the channel estimation overhead while achieving natural over-the-air model aggregation without requiring transmitter side channel state information. We have extended this principle to the downlink communication phase and developed a simple but highly effective model broadcast method for FL. We also relaxed the massive MIMO assumption by proposing an enhanced random orthogonalization design that utilizes channel echos. Theoretical performance analyses, from both communication (CRLB) and machine learning (model convergence rate) perspectives, have been carried out. The theoretical results suggested that random orthogonalization achieves the same convergence rate as vanilla FL with perfect communications asymptotically, and were further validated with numerical experiments.</p>
