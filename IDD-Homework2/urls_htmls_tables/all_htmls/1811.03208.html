<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Tree-like structures, such as blood vessels, often express complexity at very fine scales, requiring high-resolution grids to adequately describe their shape. Such sparse morphology can alternately be represented by locations of centreline points, but learning from this type of data with deep learning is challenging due to it being unordered, and permutation invariant. In this work, we propose a deep neural network that directly consumes unordered points along the centreline of a branching structure, to identify the topology of the represented structure in a single-shot. Key to our approach is the use of a novel multi-task loss function, enabling instance segmentation of arbitrarily complex branching structures. We train the network solely using synthetically generated data, utilizing domain randomization to facilitate the transfer to real 2D and 3D data. Results show that our network can reliably extract meaningful information about branch locations, bifurcations and endpoints, and sets a new benchmark for semantic instance segmentation in branching structures.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we are interested in the problem of extracting topological information from thin, branching structures, such as blood vessels, neurons, and trees in nature. The complexity of these structures is often expressed at a very fine scale, meaning that a high resolution, sparsely filled grid would be required to adequately describe their shape with pixels or voxels, making analysis computationally expensive. A possible solution to this issue is to represent the structures as centreline points in Euclidean Space, which would convert the large, sparse grid to a manageable form that allows more fine-grained structure to be represented. However, dealing with a set of points that are unordered and permutation invariant introduces some challenges. In particular, traditional deep learning architectures for geometric 3D data normally operate by exploiting relationships between neighbouring voxels, which are not present in point cloud data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The possibility of using deep networks to reason about points has been explored, resulting in networks that process point sets for the purpose of class labelling, part or semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, these networks either do not consider local information at all, instead relying on global pooling to embed relationships between individual points and the overall structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, or they extract local and global features by progressively growing scales in a hierarchical fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The latter approach has proved to be effective for processing solid, predominantly convex shapes, such as animals and furniture, but is not optimal for thin, complex structures. This is because reasoning over local neighbourhoods of points may inadvertently include nearby, disconnected branches but not current branch end points. Additionally, we aim to extract meaningful topological information such as the location of junction points, the number of individual branches, and the branches to which each point belongs, which requires a loss function that is invariant to the number of branches.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To meet these challenges, we present a data-driven topology estimation deep neural network that operates on unordered 2D or 3D centreline coordinates of thin, tubular, branching structures (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). We train our network using a novel multi-task learning framework to jointly develop branch and end-point identification abilities. Branches and end-points are identified using standard point-wise softmax loss, while individual branch instances are separated with a discriminative loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> operating at the point level. The latter allows the network to cluster an arbitrary number of branches, which can be identified in a post-processing step. The proposed network architecture, named BranchNet, is applied to the entire structure at once, helping it to develop a global reasoning and context for branch membership, but has local feature aggregation to inform junction localisation. Due to the intensive nature of the annotations required to train and validate the method, we train the network solely with synthetic data. However, we show that by applying domain randomization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> in the data generation step, the performance translates well to real blood vessel structures.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Point sets are unordered and not structured in a grid, therefore do not inherently favour a deep learning-based approach to processing. Therefore, for analysis with CNN’s, previous works have transformed point clouds into uniform grids through rasterization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, or represented them in kd-tree format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. More recent work has made progress towards directly consuming point-sets within a deep-learning framework. A pioneer in the field was PointNet, which returned a whole-set class label, or point-wise segmentation labels for a given point set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, the particularly inspiring work was PointNet++, which introduced a hierarchical feature learning architecture to mimic the progressively growing receptive fields of convolutional neural networks, enabling the network to capture local geometry context. We further improve this network structure by including global feature descriptors along with local, and defining a novel multi-task loss function to enable instance segmentation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A key difficulty associated with the naive application of a softmax cross-entropy loss function to branch instance identification is the requirement for a constant number of branches (and therefore classes), with a specific hierarchical structure, which may not hold true for particular structures, such as trees in nature. This could be addressed by imposing an upper limit to the number of branches that can be detected, however this would limit the representational power of the network, and introduce imbalances in class representation. Therefore, we propose the use of a discriminative loss function to enable semantic instance segmentation of points into branches. Our loss function is inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, where pixels in a masked image were mapped to a location in feature space close to other pixels composing the same object, but away from those representing others. Separate instances are then identified with a post-processing operation. Other forms of instance segmentation have also been proposed, including pipelines with region or object proposals followed by segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and end-to-end recurrent neural networks that perform object detection and segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In contrast to these works, our method treats the input structure holistically, which is required in case of crossing branches, and is conceptually simpler and easier to implement than recurrent networks.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several methods exist for extracting meaningful topological information from thin, tree-like structures, however no generic frameworks perform equally on both 2D and 3D structures. Successful approaches for 2D data tend to include multi-stage pipelines where regions of interest are identified and then classified. These include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, where directional filters to identify regions of interest are followed by optimisation to classify, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where a convolutional neural network is used to identify patches of interest, followed by a further neural network to classify said patches. By taking as input larger section of structures our network is able to develop a global reasoning and context for bifurcation locations and branches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Previous approaches applied to 3D data have involved combined segmentation and topology estimation by growing an area outwards from a seed point, guided by image-derived constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This approach can experience early termination in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity, and noisy images. In contrast, our algorithm does not operate on seed points, and is therefore not negatively influenced by suboptimal seed point placement. Additionally, since our network is not informed by image-based features, it is not impacted by circumstances where local image features indicate a discontinuity, or the radius experiences local changes. Since our model operates on only a skeletonised branched structure, it is task-independent, and could in theory be applied as a post-processing step following segmentation and skeletisation, in any domain involving branching structures. Furthermore, our network is a generic framework that can operate on both 2D and 3D structures.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.4 </span>Training on Synthetic Data</h3>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Use of synthetic data to train neural networks is an attractive proposition, particularly for work requiring complex annotations, where large, fully-annotated datasets are not available. Previous image-based work has attempted to make the generated data match the real data as closely as possible, by using high quality renderers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, this often still fails to accurately match the statistics of real data. Several approaches have emerged to tackle the problem of domain adaptation, including re-training in the target domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, learning invariant features between domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and learning a mapping between domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, domain randomization has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, where synthetic data is generated with sufficient variation at training time that the network is able to generalize to real-world data at test time. This process removes the need for domain adaptation, and has been used successfully for object detection and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and training robotic control processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This approach is particularly well suited to our application, since large, well-annotated datasets are not available, and randomization can be easily introduced in to the generation process of branching structures through structural changes, point jittering and dropout.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We tested the trained 2D and 3D networks on two separate, publicly available datasets. The 2D network was evaluated on retinal vasculature segmented from fundus images in the DRIVE dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. For 5 images within the test dataset, branches and branch end points were annotated manually by a human observer and checked for accuracy by a trained expert. Rather than using ground truth segmentations as input, we use the output of a pre-trained U-net<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet</span></span></span> so as to encompass any inaccuracies arising from segmentation (such as disconnected branches), thereby mimicking the use of BranchNet in a real use case. The centreline was then obtained using skeletonisation. This process is shown visually in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. 36 overlapping patches were taken from each of the images to limit the number vessels shown within each patch, and to increase the size of the test set.
The 3D network was evaluated on a centreline model of left and right coronary trees from a segmentation of a computed tomography scan (CTCA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The left and right trees are treated as separate point sets, resulting in a dataset size for testing of 2. Patches were not obtained to extend the dataset (as per the 2D data), due to the limited number of branches available in each set. Therefore, to artificially enhance the size of this dataset, the prediction for each structure was repeated 50 times, with randomised rotations of the structure.
Point sets for both datasets were then scaled to unit width, and point order randomised.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the success of instance segmentation we report two metrics defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>: Symmetric Best Dice (SBD) and Absolute Difference in Count (DiC).
Symmetric Best Dice is computed by first finding, for each input label, the ground truth label yielding the maximum Dice score. These scores are then averaged over input labels, and termed the “Best Dice” score. The “symmetric” element is introduced by repeating the process for each ground truth label paired with its most favourable input label, the minimum Best Dice score between the measures is the SBD. The Absolute Difference in Count is the absolute mean of the difference between the predicted number of branches and the ground truth over all images (lower is better).
In a test situation, the location of each individual bifurcation may be required, which is not immediately accessible if multiple points describe each bifurcation. Therefore, we identify clusters of points labelled at bifurcations by performing mean-shift clustering on these points. Ideally, cluster centres will align with actual bifurcation locations. To quantify the success of bifurcation localisation we define the Cluster-based Dice Score (<math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{DS_{C}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">DS</mi><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">C</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">DS</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">C</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathrm{DS_{C}}</annotation></semantics></math>):</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate the robustness of the network to structural complexity, we tested it against 1000 structures at each of 4 different levels of branching (bifurcations only), but no jittering or dropout. Results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1.1 Synthetic Data ‣ 5.1 Comparison of Architectures ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Interestingly, SBD results show that instance segmentation was more accurate for mid-range complexity structures. This is likely due to the longer branch length of simpler structures, resulting from structure normalisation prior to the network input. This may cause the entire branch to not be covered by the lowest resolution of grouping, and be falsely considered as multiple branches, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.1.1 Synthetic Data ‣ 5.1 Comparison of Architectures ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. However, bifurcations are clearly more difficult to accurately identify with higher numbers of branches, as is evidenced by the lower <math id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{DS_{C}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">DS</mi><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">C</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">DS</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">C</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathrm{DS_{C}}</annotation></semantics></math> results for higher complexity levels. This is unsurprising, given that the likelihood of crossover points (which are a confounding factor) increases with branch numbers. The results also show that for all complexity levels our network outperforms PointNet++.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We randomly drop increasing numbers of points during test time to validate our network’s robustness to non-uniform and sparse data (results shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1.1 Synthetic Data ‣ 5.1 Comparison of Architectures ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). For this section and the next, we tested against 1000 structures (at each perturbation level) with the 3rd level of branching (bifurcations only, 15 branches in total). Our network outperformed PointNet++, however the results were considerably closer. This is unsurprising since both models select point neighbourhoods at multiple scales, and learn how to weight them. This means that even if nearby points are missing, the available points can agglomerate features with more distant points. These results are particularly impressive given that this level of point dropout would most likely severely disrupt any traditional means of branch tracing.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate our network’s sensitivity to noisy data we jitter the point locations by sampling from zero-centred Gaussians with increasing standard deviations (results shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1.1 Synthetic Data ‣ 5.1 Comparison of Architectures ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). Jittering reduces the information inherent in local point features, which has a particularly negative effect on thin, tortuous structures. By including global information in BranchNet, we allow the network to reason over nearby groups of points. This is borne out by the improved bifurcation localisation results for our method. Additionally, including global information ensures that branches with similar structural features (such as angle and tortuosity) are less likely to be mistakenly clustered together. This is shown by the improved performance in the instance segmentation task. However, there remains room for improvement, especially when considering the poor DiC results for 3D structures with large amounts of jitter, likely due to the model predicting that connected branches were split.</p>

Furthermore, the results show that the model can distinguish between crossover points and bifurcations, and tends not to classify points near cross-overs as junctions. Impressively, the model is able to generalize to branches that are disconnected from the main structure (given that such branches were not included in the training set). Additionally, BranchNet visually outperforms PointNet++ (Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.1.2 Real Data ‣ 5.1 Comparison of Architectures ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>c) on the basis of instance segmentation, as shown by the increased number of incorrectly identified branches in PointNet++.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The most common failure of the model is splitting a single branch in to multiple instances. This failure was also apparent on synthetic data, and may be due to the lowest resolution of point grouping in the network not covering the entire branch. This particular failure points to an inherent limitation of single shot neural networks in this application. Future work will investigate methods of solving this by imbuing the network with more power to reason over different scales, such as the multi-branch convolutional network used by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> for the purpose of super-resolution. Additionally, future studies will investigate the use of including other features in to the point representation to strengthen relationships between points on the same branch. For example, including further dimensions for radius (at each point along the centreline) and image-based features such as RGB values of the respective pixels.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To study the effects of individual domain randomization parameters, we performed an ablation study by systematically omitting them one at a time. We used the same parameters as in the previous sections, but trained four additional versions of BranchNet for each 2D and 3D structures, each time fixing one of the following parameters in the synthetic data: branch length, number of branches (bifurcations only, 15 branches in total), point jitter (set to zero), or point dropout (set to zero). Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5.2 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows the results of omitting each of these individual components. We found that the method is sensitive to all of the factors, however the importance of each factor is dependent on dimensionality of the data. The success on 2D data was most dependent on randomisation of the number of branches, which reflects the large variability in number of visible branches in real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The 3D data accuracy was most negatively affected by fixing branch length in the synthetic training data. This reflects the large range in branch length of the structures. The 3D network displayed the best performance on SBD when number of branches was fixed, despite the test structures having more branches than the fixed number (15). Given the small size of the evaluation dataset for 3D data, we can not be confident in the generalizability of our ablation test results. In the future, it would be preferable to perform the analysis using a larger dataset.
Overall, relevant domain randomization parameters were clearly highly dependent on the particular dataset, but in most cases full randomization was most successful. However, performance was reduced compared to synthetic data. This suggests that the training structures do not fully encompass the range of real data, even with domain randomization.
In future studies we will investigate further randomization parameters, and the inclusion of other types of thin, tortuous network structures, not limited to those branching from a single seed point.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning based approach to automatically extract topological information from unsorted point clouds of thin tree-like 2D and 3D structures. To analyse structures with arbitrary numbers of branches we proposed a novel, multi-task loss function, incorporating cross-entropy and discriminative losses. We trained the network using extensive domain randomization applied to synthetically generated tree-like structures, and showed that it successfully transferred to real data. In the future, it would be interesting to apply this network to higher dimensional spaces where CNN architectures would be computationally unfeasible, such as time-varying 3D structures.</p>
