<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a novel distributed learning framework designed for applications with privacy-sensitive data. Without sharing data, FL trains local models on individual devices and constructs the global model on the server by performing model aggregation. However, to reduce the communication cost, the participants in each training round are randomly selected, which significantly decreases the training efficiency under data and device heterogeneity. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach that considers the data distribution and computational resources of devices to select the clients for each training round. Our proposed method performs client selection based on the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) theory by considering available computational resources for each client, the training loss, and weight divergence. To examine the usability of our proposed method, we implement our contribution on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the TensorFlow library of Python. We evaluate our algorithm’s performance in different setups by varying the learning rate, network size, the number of selected clients, and the client selection round. The evaluation results show that our proposed algorithm enhances the performance significantly in terms of test accuracy and the average client’s waiting time compared to state-of-the-art methods, federated averaging and Pow-d.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Neural Networks (NN) have become a widely used approach in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) today. Traditionally, model training involved gathering task-related data and centralized training on high-performance data centers. However, recent advancements in mobile computing have made it possible to generate large amounts of data and run complex Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on mobile devices. For instance, tasks like autonomous driving and speech recognition often require training data sets reaching terabytes in size. Generating training data continuously on millions of mobile devices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> makes centralized training approaches infeasible due to the significant increase in communication costs. Besides, centralized approaches cannot be applied to applications that use sensitive data (e.g., health applications), as they compromise user privacy by collecting and uploading user data into a centralized server.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In 2017, McMahan et al. proposed Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> as a privacy-aware distributed ML framework designed for decentralized NN training. Without sharing raw data, FL trains models locally on client devices and then uploads them to a central server for aggregation. Nevertheless, decentralized model training requires expensive communication costs on both the server and the client sides<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. For applications with a huge number of client devices (such as Google’s Gboard<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>), the vanilla Federated Averaging (FedAvg)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> randomly picks a limited number of clients<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> in different training rounds to mitigate the training cost and communication overhead. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> compares the participation of client devices in the training process of centralized and federating training (with and without client selection). As shown in this figure, under device and data heterogeneity, the random selection of client devices results in wasting computational resources and increasing the number of rounds caused by selecting resource-scare devices with poor data quality. In non-Identically and Independently Distributed (IID) data settings, the local dataset of a given client is not representative of the population distribution. As a result, the trained local models of two client devices may contribute considerably different in the aggregation process for building the global model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Under device heterogeneity, random client selection increases the average training time of an FL round. As an example, without considering computational resources, selecting client devices with less powerful processors increases the required time for a round of training as the server cannot start the aggregation before receiving local models from all clients. Furthermore, relying on random client selection may result in certain clients being excluded from the training process for extended periods of time. Therefore, labels can become excessively overfitted, discouraging clients and ultimately prompting them to lose interest in training. Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows an example of the optimal solution for selecting 50% of client devices when data quality and computational resources vary among different devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above-mentioned issues, designing an efficient client selection algorithm for FL is in great demand. To address this challenge, various approaches have been explored. For instance, reinforcement learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> models can be trained to help the server make efficient decisions, or game-theory approaches can be used to find an optimal solution in the Pareto frontier among participating clients. However, it’s important to note that while these methods can be effective, they are challenging to be implemented, demanding significant computational resources, inflexible in certain scenarios, and reliant on specific evaluation metrics.</p>

The efficiency of FedAvg is notably impacted when only a subset of clients participate in each training round. The primary goals of client selection methods are to enhance model performance with limited clients and reduce communication costs. Common client selection approaches involve either 1) assessing and selecting clients based on specific metrics like hardware performance, communication costs, and training loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, or 2) considering clients’ contributions to the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

As a result, the accuracy of the global model significantly diminishes compared to scenarios with IID data. Various methods have been developed to reduce the impact of data non-IIDness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> by considering the discrepancy between the optimal values of global and weighted local objective functions.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the energy consumption of client devices and communication cost, a small subset of clients with varying computational resources (including GPU, CPU, and RAM) is chosen for each training round.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In non-IID data scenarios of FL, clients have training data for different classes. As an example, Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A Clients with Heterogeneous Computational Resources ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows a non-IID data distribution for the image classification problem of MNIST dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> under random client selection. As shown in this figure, the whole distributed data set used in a round of training is unbalanced (different classes have varied numbers of samples), following a long-tail distribution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. In non-IID data scenarios, some classes being excessively over-fitted in one training round while the entire set of all classes are failed to be covered. For instance, in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A Clients with Heterogeneous Computational Resources ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the number of samples for class 8 is many more than the sum of the numbers of samples for classes 0, 1, and 2. In this setting, by reducing the number of selected clients, more training rounds are required to achieve the same test accuracy. To assess this problem, we vary the data distribution and the number of selected clients in our experiments. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ III-A Clients with Heterogeneous Computational Resources ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>, the test accuracy of the global model drops significantly as the number of classes assigned to each client decreases. When each client device has data for all classes (IID data), after around 2 rounds, the global model’s accuracy reaches 98%. However, for experiments with two different classes assigned to each client, the accuracy fluctuates widely in different rounds, and after 22 rounds it reaches to 80%. These results indicate that distributing data with a higher level of non-IIDness among clients makes the convergence rate slower and increases accuracy fluctuation. Fig. <a href="#S3.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ III-A Clients with Heterogeneous Computational Resources ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> shows the performance of FedAvg for different numbers of selected clients. When 10 clients are selected for training, it takes 75 rounds to reach around 80% accuracy, which is 66 rounds more than that for the case all clients participate in training. Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Measurements of Device heterogeneity ‣ IV FedGRA ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows the ideal client selection for non-IID data compared to the random selection. As this figure shows, for the ideal client selection, data from all classes are used in a round of training. Although, random selection does not select any client for class 2. In addition, the random selection also may not select certain clients for multiple training rounds. This becomes problematic in the presence of non-IID data, as a biased client selection can amplify the skewness of training data. Consequently, the global model might perform well only for a subset of classes.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">As personal mobile devices typically run training programs in parallel with other tasks, utilization rates of computational resources depend on the other applications that a user runs on the mobile device. As an example, between two mobile devices with the same hardware configuration, training data on the device running a 3D game takes longer than a mobile device that hosts the web browser application. Although predicting the exact available computational resources for training data at a specific time is impractical, the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) can be used to estimate the load of CPU and RAM resources based on their usage in the current and previous rounds. For instance, the weighted average RAM usage of device <math id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math> at round <math id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> can be estimated by:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">FedGRA uses mutually exclusive metrics loss and weight divergence. We adjust their priorities in the client selection process by using the Entropy Weight Method (EWM) to set the weight of the GRCs. For instance, EWM calculates the information entropy of each metric and gives higher weight to metrics with low information entropy as they are more comparable. At the beginning of the training, most of the clients have similar weight divergence due to the lack of enough training data for all classes. This problem is alleviated after performing several rounds of model aggregation at the server. Hence, in the first few rounds, EWM assigns more weight to the loss metric to ensure that the head classes can be trained. After a certain number of training rounds, training loss for most of the clients converges to a certain value and the information entropy of the loss will be higher than the weight divergence. Then, EWM considers a higher priority for the weight divergence and asks clients with data not fitted well to the global model to participate in training. This dynamic adjustment encourages the participation of clients whose classes are less adequately generalized by the global model.

This approach gives priority to clients with higher local losses, aiming to accelerate the convergence of the global model more efficiently compared to a completely stochastic client selection process. This strategy effectively minimizes the chances of repeatedly involving the same client in training sessions and effectively reduces the complexity of searching for clients with higher local loss in large-scale FL systems. In general, Pow-d reduces the time cost search for clients with the highest local loss to balance time cost and convergence in the client selection process.</p>

To handle data distribution across client devices, Amazon S3 is used as the main storage for saving the data set and Python scripts required for running the model training on client devices. By using the AWS systems manager, we launch a bash command for all EC2 instances to download the files. To facilitate communication between the server and clients, we use Python sockets, Amazon S3, and Amazon SQS services that allow us to send, store, and receive messages from software components. These messages will contain the necessary information for either the server or the clients, such as locally trained weights, the globally aggregated model, and the number of data trained on each client. These messages are very large in terms of size. Therefore, we use Amazon S3 to store the messages and send the link of the message in the SQS message content. Utilizing Amazon SQS solves the problem of network congestion for a large number of clients. This is beneficial for the server to process multiple messages sequentially. The clients, on the other hand, do not need to utilize SQS as there is only one message from the server sent to every client. The server will only need to upload its message to S3 and then clients will receive it by checking the queue periodically. To avoid user dropout for instances with extremely limited resources (having 2GB of RAM), we select MNIST and FMNIST datasets for our experiments to ensure the stability and reproducibility of our results. User dropout is a critical factor for running FL on resource-limited devices that can affect results in different runs with the same configuration.</p>

The server’s task includes assigning the client’s data to make a non-IID scenario, aggregating model weight, distributing initial weights, and selecting clients based on different algorithms. The client’s task performs local training, collecting the device’s hardware and data metrics, and sending weight to the server. In the framework we deployed on AWS, clients and the server maintain a constant and dynamic interaction by using the AWS S3 bucket. They monitor a specified S3 bucket and by receiving a new JSON file, both the server and clients download and unpack it immediately. The server’s bucket holds the instructional files for each client, which contain the tasks to be performed. Concurrently, the client’s bucket contains clients’ upload files containing their model weights and hardware metrics. Clients execute tasks according to the server’s order, while the server aggregates clients’ updates to refine a new global model. Subsequently, the server sends the command file to selected clients to participate in training in the next round.</p>

To distribute the data set among client devices, first, we split the MNIST dataset into 10 different subsets while each subset has all data for one class. As an example, in MNIST, the subset for class 0 has 5923 samples. Then, we divide each data subset into slices with a predefined fixed size and assign one data slice to each client.

<p id="S6.SS5.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This metric reflects the computational capacity gap between the most and least capable clients in training. A higher degree of hardware heterogeneity among the clients can significantly extend the waiting time for clients with high-performance resources. The average waiting time reflects how a client selection algorithm utilizes computational resources to mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity in the training process. This metric represents the degree of device heterogeneity involved in the training process and highlights the hardware capability gap among participant devices. As Table <a href="#S6.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VI-E2 Average Waiting Time ‣ VI-E Evaluation Results ‣ VI Implementation and Performance Evaluation ‣ Optimization of Federated Learning’s Client Selection for Non-IID Data Based on Grey Relational Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> illustrates, for training MNIST by using CNN model, FedGRA’s maximum waiting time is 48.7% of that of FedAvg. However, for the experiment with 2NN, FedAvg demonstrates a slightly shorter waiting time than FedGRA owing to the relative simplicity of the 2NN model compared to CNN. These results indicate the problem of device heterogeneity becomes more critical by increasing the complexity of machine learning models.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented FedGRA, a grey relation analysis theory-based client selection method designed to handle data and device heterogeneity for FL. FedGRA leverages weight divergence and training loss to identify clients that can speed up the convergence of the global model during training under a high level of data non-IIDness. To assess FedGRA’s effectiveness, we implemented our proposed method by using TensorFlow and evaluated its performance on a testbed of 50 AWS EC2 instances configured with the most common hardware configurations of mobile devices. By using MNIST and FMNIST datasets, we evaluated the performance of our contribution through a comprehensive series of experiments. Our evaluation results for MNIST and FMNIST datasets indicate that FedGRA significantly improves training efficiency by enhancing the convergence of the global model and also reducing the average client’s waiting time in a round of training, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>
