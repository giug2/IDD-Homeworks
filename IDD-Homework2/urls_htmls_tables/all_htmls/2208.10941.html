<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">With increasing concerns for data privacy and ownership, recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in machine learning (ML). An emerging paradigm, federated learning (FL), has gained great attention and has become a novel design for machine learning implementations. FL enables the ML model training at data silos under the coordination of a central server, eliminating communication overhead and without sharing raw data. In this paper, we conduct a review of the FL paradigm and, in particular, compare the types, the network structures, and the global model aggregation methods. Then, we conducted a comprehensive review of FL applications in the energy domain (refer to the smart grid in this paper). We provide a thematic classification of FL to address a variety of energy-related problems, including demand response, identification, prediction, and federated optimizations. We describe the taxonomy in detail and conclude with a discussion of various aspects, including challenges, opportunities, and limitations in its energy informatics applications, such as energy system modeling and design, privacy, and evolution.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Today the demand for energy is increasing rapidly in the global, due to population and economic growth. The building sector accounts for 40% of total energy consumption and 60% of electricity consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Distributed energy resources are a viable solution to address this problem by integrating distributed energy systems at users. Distributed energy systems have the characteristics of high efficiency, low loss, low pollution, and flexible operations. On the other hand, for electricity supply, smart grids have intensively adopted the Internet of Things (IoT), smart meters, and advanced communication networks (e.g. 5G) and data management systems, which form an advanced energy management infrastructure. Smart grids and distributed energy systems together form a giant energy of the Internet (IoE) to provide stable and sustainable energy to end users. However, several prominent issues arise with the provision of various energy services, the management of massive data, and the offloading of computing workloads from the cloud. First, data privacy becomes a major concern as customer data is often used to train data-driven models, e.g., for detecting malicious nodes in IoE. Therefore, it has to access private customer information, such as consumption profiles and habits, to train the model. Second, data owners may not be willing to share their data to a centralized server for model training, mainly due to privacy, commercial competition, and technical barrier reasons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. At the legal level, governments or organizations around the world are also increasingly committed to data privacy protection. For example, the European Union has enforced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since 2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Third, the computing resource requirements for traditional centralized model training are relatively high due to the management of large amounts of data sets. Last, data transmission over the network is vulnerable to cyberattacks and introduces overhead. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a feasible solution to address these issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an ideal paradigm, which was first introduced by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FL is essentially a distributed learning approach, where multiple distributed clients train machine learning models separately using their own local data under the coordination of a central server, then the server aggregates the trained models into a final global model. Training is an iterative process that involves updating local models and aggregating the global model until the model converges or the training reaches the predefined number of interactions. FL is a major shift from centralized and expensive machine learning to a distributed manner that can use many distributed computing resources. This learning paradigm improves data privacy, as the raw data remain on the local device, eliminating network overhead as only the model updates are exchanged. In recent years, FL has been used successfully in industries related to IoT and edge computing, mainly for privacy protection, but it is attracting more and more interest. Some literature reviews were performed not only on FL technology itself, such as the different FL architectures and their learning settings, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, but also its applications, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, there is still no systematic review of FL applications in energy. This is likely due to more research efforts in areas directly related to the protection of personal information privacy, such as medicine, healthcare, and insurance. On the contrary, the literature on FL in energy is much fewer and all of them emerged within the last two years. However, we have seen that growth is fast and its applications go beyond addressing data privacy, which is raising great research attention in the energy community. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to conduct a systematic review. In this paper, we will classify and summarize the different solutions based on FL and their applications in the energy sector. Moreover, unlike other reviews of FL technologies which focus on different architectures and complementary technologies to enhance FL, we pay special attention to different aggregate algorithms to generate the global model. This review can help advance understanding of FL technology and promote its use cases in the energy sector.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL provides a novel machine learning solution with distributed and enhanced privacy capabilities for many energy applications, which has the potential to shape current energy systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. With growing concerns about privacy issues, FL is particularly attractive for constructing a distributed model by pushing machine learning functions to the edge of the energy system when the data reside. Eventually, the data of each energy system is never directly shared with others under the FL framework, while supporting collaborative learning of shared global models, which benefits both grid operators and energy users in terms of network resource savings and enhanced privacy. As such, FL is a powerful alternative to traditional centralized machine learning approaches.</p>

In this type of FL, there is a central server and a set of clients that execute the FL model. During a training round, all clients participate in the training of the network model in parallel using their own data. All clients then transmit the trained parameters to the central server, which aggregates these parameters using a weighted average algorithm such as FedAvg. Then, the computed global model is sent back to all clients for the next training iteration. At the end of the training process, each client receives an identical global model and its personalized model. This type of FL is highly dependent on the server model to coordinate the aggregation and distribute model updates.</p>

In this way, in each round of communication, clients are also trained locally on their own data. Each client then implements model aggregation using model updates received from neighboring clients via P2P communication to agree on global updates. A distributed FL is designed to completely or partially replace central server-based FL when communication with the server is unavailable or when the network topology is highly scalable. Due to its contemporary features, a distributed FL can be integrated with P2P-based communication technologies such as blockchain to build a decentralized FL system. In this way, distributed FL clients can communicate through a blockchain ledger where model updates can be offloaded to the blockchain for secure model exchange and aggregation.</p>

As a particular data-driven model, technology innovation will only bring value when it fits into a particular use case. Therefore, we will first briefly introduce the general conditions of the smart grid domain, which is under dramatic changes. The main players that shape the landscape of the smart grid will be identified. Next, emerging FL applications based on the current literature review will be summarized from a use case perspective, along with their particular technology contributions. Special attention is paid to the aggregation mechanism for each FL application, as different use cases usually need customized FL frameworks with specific aggregation models.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a new paradigm of distributed learning across different devices, data centers, and geographic locations. It is also a multidisciplinary learning framework that involves several disciplines, including cryptography, databases, and machine learning. Among many others, the challenges and opportunities of FL are summarized as follows: 1) How to improve the efficiency of the communication between the central server and the clients, which mainly involves how to reduce the number of communications and compress the data. 2) How to protect the security of the data on the communication during the model training process. In this regard, data encryption techniques can be applied, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. 3) How to partition the data on the client side to achieve optimal parallel learning efficiency. Existing studies focus on the application of horizontal and vertical data partitioning strategies. 4) How to deal with non-identical distribution problems of the training data. These can be problems of skewed feature distribution and/or skewed label distribution. 5) How to improve learning efficiency, which mainly consists of studying how to optimize the machine learning algorithm and accelerate model convergence. 6) How to achieve multitask learning and personalized learning in a federated setting. Since clients may have different models, settings, and devices, this heterogeneity determines the challenges of balancing parallel tasks, thus providing personalized learning opportunities. 7) How to design machine learning algorithms and tune hyperparameters in an FL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above are the main challenges and opportunities for FL technology itself, which has been the subject of many research efforts. As a result, this has led to a large number of review articles; in this paper, we instead have focused on the other aspect that we think is most interesting, but has not yet been examined, namely, the global model generation algorithms. Aggregation algorithms are directly related to the performance of the final model, such as generality. In addition, we believe that FL should be fully decentralized or support peer-to-peer distributed learning, similar to blockchain technology where learning is consensus-based. Finally, due to the complexity of implementing FL technology and the applications it supports, we believe it would be beneficial to integrate visualization into an FL framework, which can greatly lower the learning curve and improve the interpretability of machine learning models implemented in an FL framework.</p>

<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL has a wide range of potential in the field of energy, which can be summarized as follows. First, it is often difficult to create powerful data-driven models for renewable energy prediction, mainly because of inherent stochasticity. For example, wind power generation is affected by wind speed, and solar photovoltaic energy is affected by the intensity and timing of solar exposure. Training a forecasting model with high accuracy and generality requires different data sources, which may be from power plants at different geographical locations. However, these data may not be available due to data ownership or commercial competition, in which case FL becomes essential to create a collaborative prediction model. Second, in the residential building sector, FL can help protect the privacy of customer information. For example, in Europe, the residential electricity supply is often operated by different distributors, each of which has its own customers. In order to create data-driven models from energy consumption and customer information, FL can address the model in a non-sharing environment with data privacy guarantee. This makes it possible to provide personalized energy services, such as energy-efficiency product recommendations, demand-response programs, and customized energy management solutions. Although research has been conducted on personalized recommendations based on FL in other fields, its applications in the energy sector remain an open problem that is interesting to investigate. Finally, energy involves many distributed optimization problems, including production, transportation, and distribution. The advantage of applying federated-based optimization is that it supports heterogeneous models, i.e., the model structure does not need to be consistent across different nodes. Therefore, an ensemble-like heterogeneous distributed optimization model can be established to help with decision making regarding energy planning or supply.</p>

<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We are aware that energy is a very broad concept that has many subdomains. For example, depending on the types of energy, it can be divided into water, electricity, gas, heat, etc., each with its own life cycle for an energy system. In addition, there are many other energy-related research areas, including market, price, regulation, and policies. Therefore, FL has a wide potential in energy.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is an emerging computing paradigm. In this paper, we presented a systematic review of FL and its applications in the energy sector. We first introduced the concept of FL, the technical advances especially about the research of solutions, network structures, and global model generation algorithms. Then, we investigated various solutions and applications of FL in energy, mainly involving demand-response programs, user characteristics identification, customer segmentation, energy prediction, and optimization. We also discussed the technical challenges and opportunities of the FL technology itself and enumerated its opportunities in the energy sector. We hope that this survey will help researchers refine FL techniques and provide useful reference material for researchers in the energy field.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future work, we will improve our review in a more systematic way and update the latest research advances on FL and its applications in energy. We also intend to develop an FL benchmarking and evaluation tool, as no such tool is available to date.</p>
