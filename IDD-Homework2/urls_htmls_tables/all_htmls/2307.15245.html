<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has been an area of active research in recent years. There have been numerous studies in FL to make it more successful in <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> presence of data heterogeneity. However, despite the existence of many publications, the <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">state</span> of progress in the field is unknown.

<p id="p1.2" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning aims to train a machine learning model using the massive decentralized data available at IoT and mobile devices, and different data centers while maintaining data privacy. However, despite the existence of numerous works, the state of progress in the field is not well-understood. Papers use different methodologies and experimental setups that <span id="p1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">are</span> hard to compare and examine the effectiveness of methods in more general settings. Moreover, the effect of federated learning experimental design factors such as local epochs, and sample rate on the performance results have remained unstudied in the field. Our work comprehensively studies the effect of experimental design factors in federated learning, provides suggestions and insights, introduces FedZoo-Bench with <span id="p1.2.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> pre-implementation of 22 state-of-the-art algorithms under a unified setting, and finally measures the state of progress in the field. The studies and findings discussed in our work can significantly help the federated learning field by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of experimental design factors, facilitating the design of better performing algorithms, and enabling <span id="p1.2.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">a</span> more accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of different methods.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning setting, which aims to collaboratively train machine learning models with the participation of several clients under the orchestration of a central server in a privacy-preserving and communication efficient manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. FL has seen a surge of interest in the machine learning research community in recent years, thanks to its potential to improve the performance of edge users without compromising data privacy. This innovative approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The ultimate goal of standard (global) FL is to train a shared global model which uniformly performs well over almost the entire participating clients. However, the inherent diversity and not independent and identical (Non-IID) distribution of clients’ local data <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">has</span> made the global FL approach very challenging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>. Indeed, clients’ incentives to participate in FL can be to derive personalized models rather than learning a shared global model. This client-centric perspective along with the challenges in the global FL approach under Non-IID data distributions has motivated an alternative personalized FL approach. Personalized FL aims to learn personalized models performing well according to the distinct data distribution of each participating client.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the significant <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">number</span> of works that have been done in both global and personalized FL approaches under data heterogeneity, the state of progress is not well understood in the FL community. In particular, the following key questions have remained unanswered in the existing literature: what factors affect experimental results and how to control them? Which experimental design setups are effective and well-incentivized for a fair comparison in each FL approach? What are the best practices and remedies to compare different methods and avoid evaluation failure? We primarily find that the methodologies, experimental setups, and evaluation metrics are so inconsistent between papers that a comprehensive comparison is impossible. For example, some papers consider a specific FL approach, however, they use an experimental setup <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">that</span> is not well-incentivized or has been created to match their assumptions and <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">is</span> not applicable to other cases. Moreover, the existence of numerous benchmarks and inconsistent implementation environments together with different confounding variables such as data augmentation and pre-processing techniques, choice of <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> optimizer, and learning rate schedule have made such comparison even more difficult.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the mentioned issues in the current state of FL research, we present the first comprehensive study, to the best of our knowledge, on FL-specific experimental variables and provide new insights and best practices for a meaningful and well-incentivized FL experimental design for each FL approach. We also introduce FedZoo-Bench, an open-source library based on PyTorch that provides a commonly used set of standardized and customizable features in FL, and implementation of 22 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods under a unified setting to make FL research more reproducible and comparable. Finally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of several SOTA methods in terms of performance, fairness, and generalization to newcomers, to provide a clear understanding of the promises and limitations of existing methods.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Global FL.</span> McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> proposed the first method for global FL called FedAvg which simply averages the local models to update the server-side model. This FL approach mainly suffers from poor convergence and degradation of the results in <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> presence of data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite>. Some works attempt to address these issues by regularizing local training. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> uses an L2 regularizer on the weight difference between the local and global model. MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> utilizes contrastive learning to preserve global knowledge during local training. In FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, an on<span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">-</span>device dynamic regularization at each round has been used to align the local and global solutions. Another set of works <span id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">studies</span> the optimization issues of FedAvg in the presence of data heterogeneity and <span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">proposes</span> alternative optimization procedures with better convergence guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite> addresses the objective inconsistency caused by heterogeneity in the local updates by weighting the local models in server-side averaging to eliminate bias in the solution and achieve fast error convergence. Scaffold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposes control variates to correct the local updates and eliminate the “client drift” which happens because of data heterogeneity resulting <span id="S2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">in</span> convergence rate improvement. Other approaches have focused on proposing better model fusion techniques to improve performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> adds a server-side KL training step after averaging local models by using the average of clients’ logits on a public dataset. FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite> proposes averaging on the matched neurons of the models at each layer. GAMF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> formulates model fusion as a graph matching task by considering neurons or channels as nodes and weights as edges. For a more detailed review of methods on global FL literature, we recommend reading the surveys <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

Personalized FL aims to obtain personalized models for participating clients. There are various efforts to solve this problem through different techniques. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based techniques have been proposed in a number of works by considering clients as tasks and framing the personalized FL as an MTL problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Another group of studies <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">proposes</span> model interpolation techniques by mixing the global and local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>.

They often only realize the global FL approach and implement basic algorithms (e.g. FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, while other benchmarks,such as FLOWER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, FLUTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and NIID-Bench <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, offer more customizable features, and implementation of more algorithms. For a more detailed review <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">of</span> the applicability and comparison <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">of</span> the existing benchmarks, we defer the reader to UniFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. While the majority of existing benchmarks are for global FL, there are <span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">a</span> few recently released personalized FL benchmarks, including pFL-Bench <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and Motley <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>. However, these benchmarks do not investigate the effect of experimental variables and only consider a few algorithms and their variants for comparison. In contrast, FedZoo-Bench offers support for both global and personalized FL approaches, providing implementation of 22 SOTA methods and the ability to assess generalization to newcomers. Additionally, our study on the effect of FL-specific experimental variables in relation to each other and performance results, together with <span id="S2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> identification of more meaningful setups for each FL approach, is a new contribution to the field.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a thorough examination of key variables that influence the success of FL experiments. Firstly, we provide new insights and analysis of the FL-specific variables in relation to each other and performance results by running several experiments. We then use our analysis to identify recommendations and best practices for a meaningful and well-incentivized FL experimental design. We have also developed FedZoo-Bench, an open-source library based on PyTorch that provides a comprehensive set of standardized and customizable features, different evaluation metrics, and implementation of 22 SOTA methods. FedZoo-Bench facilitates a more consistent and reproducible FL research. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several SOTA methods in terms of performance, fairness, and generalization to newcomers using FedZoo-Bench. We hope that our work will help the FL community to better understand the state of progress in the field and encourage a more comparable and consistent FL research.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we plan to expand our study to other domains such as natural language processing and graph neural networks to understand how FL experimental settings behave in those areas <span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">and to assess its versatility and applicability across different problem domains.</span> Additionally, we will continue to improve our benchmark by implementing more algorithms and adding new features. <span id="S7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We also have plans to establish an open leaderboard using FedZoo-Bench, enabling systematic evaluations of FL methods across a wide variety of datasets and settings.</span> Based on the comparison results presented in Section <a href="#S6.SS1" title="6.1 Comparison of SOTA methods ‣ 6 FedZoo-Bench ‣ A Practical Recipe for Federated Learning Under Statistical Heterogeneity Experimental Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.1</span></a>, we also believe that <span id="S7.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> development of new algorithms for both global and personalized FL approaches to achieve even greater improvement and more consistent results across different experimental settings would be an exciting future avenue.
