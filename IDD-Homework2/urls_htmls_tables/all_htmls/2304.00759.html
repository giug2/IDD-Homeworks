<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) facilitates edge devices to cooperatively train a global shared model while maintaining the training data locally and privately. However, a common assumption in FL requires the participating edge devices to have similar computation resources and train on an identical global model architecture.
In this study, we propose an FL method called Federated Intermediate Layers Learning (FedIN), supporting heterogeneous models without relying on any public dataset. Instead, FedIN leverages the inherent knowledge embedded in client model features to facilitate knowledge exchange.
The training models in FedIN are partitioned into three distinct components: an extractor, intermediate layers, and a classifier. We capture client features by extracting the outputs of the extractor and the inputs of the classifier.
To harness the knowledge from client features, we propose IN training for aligning the intermediate layers based on features obtained from other clients. IN training only needs minimal memory and communication overhead by utilizing a single batch of client features.
Additionally, we formulate and address a convex optimization problem to mitigate the challenge of gradient divergence caused by conflicts between IN training and local training.
The experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of FedIN in heterogeneous model environments compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of IN training and the proposed solution for alleviating gradient divergence.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The massive increase in the usage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices induces enormous amounts of data from users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Managing these IoT big data efficiently without invading user privacy becomes a significant concern. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning</span> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is proposed as a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training on the IoT data while keeping the user data locally. FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is the first training paradigm introducing the details of FL. All the clients transmit weights from their local models to the server after a few local training epochs. The server averages these weights to update the global model and sends this model back to clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has been employed successfully in many applications, such as recognizing human activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and learning sentiment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, many practical challenges of FL still remain to be solved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
One of the most crucial and practical challenges is system heterogeneity, which is usually described as different available resources of the client devices in the FL training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Many existing FL schemes (e.g., FedAvg) assume that the client devices with distinct resources possess the same architecture as the global shared model for global aggregation. Nevertheless, some clients with lower computation resources may be unable to complete their local training in time, dragging the training speed of the entire communication round. The clients hindering the training process are called stragglers. Some research has proposed asynchronous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, maintaining the adaptive local training epochs for clients and clustering clients according to their available resources in order to mitigate the problem of stragglers.
Nonetheless, given that all clients keep the same model architecture, it is still possible that less capable clients do not have sufficient memory to deploy the shared global model.
In this case, the global model must be adjusted to a smaller size, leading to the resource waste of more capable clients and reducing the performance of FL training.
In fact, it is impractical to guarantee that all the clients have the same amount of resources, particularly in IoT systems. It is common to have heterogeneous devices with different capabilities working together. Thus, supporting heterogeneous models could fully utilize the resources of heterogeneous devices and better address the system heterogeneity problem.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A straightforward way to facilitate system heterogeneity is to deploy different model architectures based on the available resources of the clients, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. However, the server can not aggregate the weights directly like FedAvg under the heterogeneous model architectures. It is essential to investigate alternative ways to incorporate weights and knowledge among the clients. Some recent works propose to solve this problem by performing knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> on a public dataset, such as RHFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Although they can set up various model architectures in the clients, it is challenging to collect a valid public dataset with a similar distribution to the users’ local datasets in practice.
To address this issue, inspired by model parallelism-based split learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, FedGKT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> divides the model architectures into two parts, collecting features from the outputs of the former part of models in the clients and training the remaining model in the server based on the collected features.
HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is another line of work to support heterogeneous models without relying on a public dataset. It derives local models with different sizes from the largest model (considered to be the server model). However, this approach still requires all client models to share the same architecture design just with different sizes.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To support system heterogeneity, we propose a method called Federated Intermediate Layers Learning (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedIN</span>), training the intermediate layers according to one batch of the collected features from other clients. In FedIN, a local model architecture consists of three components: an extractor, intermediate layers, and a classifier, as depicted in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2.3 Sub-models ‣ 2.2 Heterogeneous Models ‣ 2 Related work ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Client features are derived from the outputs of the extractor and the inputs to the classifier.
Notably, clients only need to transmit <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">one batch</span> of features to the server, in addition to weight updates.
The intermediate layers are updated through a combination of local training and <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">IN</span> training process, where IN training leverages a single batch of features to extract knowledge from other clients.
However, directly deploying these two training processes can induce a critical problem called gradient divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> because the latent information from the local dataset and the features collected from other clients varies. To alleviate the effect of this problem, we formulate and solve a convex optimization problem to obtain the optimal updated gradients.
The experiment results demonstrate that FedIN outperforms the baselines in terms of both accuracy and overheads.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) was proposed by Google in 2017 to organize cooperative model training among edge devices and servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In FL, numerous clients train models jointly while retaining training data locally to maintain privacy protection. Various methods have been proposed and achieved good performance in different scenarios.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, FedAsyn utilizes coordinators and schedulers to create an asynchronous training process, handling the stragglers in the FL training process.
FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> regularizes and re-parametrizes FedAvg, guaranteeing convergence when learning over non-IID data.
To share local knowledge among clients with different model architectures, FCCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> generates a cross-correlation matrix based on the unlabeled public dataset.

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">If a server has a public dataset, clients can exploit the general knowledge from this dataset, constructing a simple and efficient bridge to exchange knowledge among clients.
FedAUX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> utilizes unsupervised pre-training and unlabeled auxiliary data to initialize heterogeneous models.
FedGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> simulates the prior knowledge from all the clients according to a generator.
To dig out the latent knowledge from the public dataset, several studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are proposed to address the system heterogeneity problem, inspired by the knowledge distillation. Specifically,
knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> was proposed by Hinton et al., training a student model with the knowledge distilled from a teacher model.
In FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a large public dataset is deployed in a server, while the clients distill and transmit logits from this dataset to learn the knowledge from both logits and local private datasets.
In FedH2L <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, clients extract the logits from a public dataset consisting of small portions of local datasets from other clients.
In RHFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a server calculates the weights of clients by the symmetric cross-entropy loss function, and clients distilled knowledge from the unlabeled dataset.
FCCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> computed a cross-correlation matrix also based on the unlabeled public dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">However, the former methods using KD in FL acquire a public dataset. The server may not collect sufficient data due to data availability and privacy concerns.
In contrast to the aforementioned methods, data-free KD is a novel approach to complete the knowledge distillation process without the training data. The basic ideas of data-free KD are to optimize noise inputs to minimize the distance to prior knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> train Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> to generate training data for the entire KD process, utilizing the knowledge distilled from the teacher model.
To free the limitation from a public dataset, a few research works consider data-free KD in FL.
In FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, latent knowledge from homogeneous models is applied to train heterogeneous models.
In FedHe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, logits belonging to the same class are directly averaged in a server.
In FedGKT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a neural network is split into a client and a server, while the server completes the entire training process based on the features and logits collected from all clients. Most of the existing data-free approaches are based on logits.
While FedIN is also a data-free approach, instead of transmitting the logits, the knowledge exchanged in FedIN also includes the client features, which contain more information than simply using the logits.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To adapt to the available resources of different clients, several studies split the large models into small sub-models. HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> divides a large model into local models with different sizes. However, the architectures of local and global models are still restricted by the same model architecture. SlimFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> integrates slimmable neural network (SNN) architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> into FL, adapting the widths of local neural networks based on resource limitations. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, FjORD leverages Ordered Dropout and a self-distillation method to determine the model widths. However, similar to HeteroFL, they only vary the number of parameters for each layer. In this paper, we propose a more heterogeneous and flexible FL framework supporting various edge devices.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">However, it is possible that the gradients from the local training and the IN training are divergent, which would drag the convergent speed and disturb the model to achieve the optimum point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. It is crucial to alleviate the gradients divergence problem in our method.
Therefore, how to mitigate this problem is critical in FedIN. To address this problem, we formulate a convex optimization problem as follows.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedIN does not impose any limitations on the model architecture, indicating that diverse model architectures can be deployed in FedIN by leveraging a single batch of client features as the communication knowledge. If client models have different numbers of layers, FedIN adopts layer-wise heterogeneous aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, enabling the server to aggregate weights from the same layer rather than the same model. Similarly, when client models have different architectures, FedIN aggregates model weights only from models with identical architectures, the same as the aggregation method used in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. For example, the weights of CNNs cannot be aggregated with the weights of Transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. However, the weights of CNNs can be aggregated with other CNNs possessing the same depths and widths.
The effectiveness of FedIN with these two distinctive aggregation methods is further demonstrated in our experimental section.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">FedIN and the baselines, with the exception of HeteroFL, utilize the layer-wise aggregation technique proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> under our heterogeneous model environment. Since HeteroFL requires model splitting based on its own methodology, it cannot utilize this aggregation technique. Therefore, in order to maintain a similar number of parameters as the other baselines, we deploy ResNet152 in HeteroFL instead of using the largest model, ResNet26, as in other methods. The model split mode in HeteroFL is ”dynamic_a1-b1-c1-d1-e1” from the source code because of five heterogeneous models in all other methods.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure a fair comparison, both the baselines and FedIN employ layer-wise aggregation. However, it is worth noting that FedIN can be deployed in scenarios with extreme heterogeneity, where layer-wise aggregation is not feasible. In such cases, model weights with the same architectures are the only ones that can be aggregated. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FedIN in such extreme environments, we conducted experiments on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, utilizing FedAvg aggregation. The remaining federated settings are the same in this experiment.
As indicated in TABLE <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 5.2.2 Accuracy of homogeneous models ‣ 5.2 Accuracy Analyses. ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, FedIN still achieves the highest accuracy, 88.9% on IID data and 88.0% on non-IID data.

When FedIN disregards this problem, it updates the entire model from the local training, and then continues to update the intermediate layers from the IN training, as depicted by the result of FedIN w/o Opt in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3.2 t-SNE visualization ‣ 5.3 The Reason for the Improvements ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
The accuracy achieved by FedIN surpasses that of FedIN without gradient alleviation (FedIN w/o Opt), and the convergence speed of FedIN is also accelerated, as observed in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3.2 t-SNE visualization ‣ 5.3 The Reason for the Improvements ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

<div id="S5.SS4.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FedIN, the loss function (Eq. <a href="#S4.E14" title="In 4.2 Gradient Alleviation ‣ 4 FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>) incorporates two additional terms, one is IN loss and the other one is Prox regularized term. When considering FedIN w/o Prox, the client models are trained without regularization, and the convergent speed is similar to FedIN w/o IN before 200 rounds as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3.2 t-SNE visualization ‣ 5.3 The Reason for the Improvements ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. However, after 200 rounds, FedIN w/o Prox becomes unstable and its performance deteriorates during the subsequent training process, suggesting that the client models are overfitting to their local dataset. At last, FedIN w/o Prox only achieves the performance like FedAvg, as shown in TABLE <a href="#S5.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ 5.3.2 t-SNE visualization ‣ 5.3 The Reason for the Improvements ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>, hinting that the function of IN loss is eliminated at the end of the training process. Therefore, the inclusion of a regularized term becomes essential to maintain the effectiveness of IN loss throughout the training process. After adding the Prox regularized term, FedIN w/o Opt achieves better results than FedIN w/o In and FedIN w/o Prox, indicating the efficiency of the combination of IN loss and Prox regularized term.</p>

Notably, FedIN outperforms the other methods across all settings of different client numbers. Furthermore, as the number of clients increases, we observe a decline in accuracy because the amount of local data for each client is also decreased. In the context of a higher number of clients, such as 200 clients, the clients face greater challenges in learning meaningful features due to the limited local data. However, FedIN still achieves 72.2% with 200 clients under non-IID data, surpassing the performance of FedAvg (62.5%) and InclusiveFL (61.2%). These results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the FedIN method in handling the challenges posed by a high number of clients.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel method, called FedIN, which supports model heterogeneity in FL environment.
FedIN conducts local training based on the private dataset and IN training from the client features, requiring only one batch of features. Moreover, we formulate a convex optimization problem to tackle the gradient divergence problem induced by a combination of local training and IN training. We conduct extensive experiments on IID data and non-IID data from three public datasets with seven baselines. The experiment results illustrate that FedIN achieves superior performances in both IID data and non-IID data. Moreover, we conducted an analysis to elucidate the efficiency and effectiveness of FedIN in heterogeneous environments.
Furthermore, we investigated the contributions of each component of FedIN in the ablation studies. These studies not only highlight the advantages of our proposed solution for addressing the gradient divergence problem but also emphasize the importance of IN training and the impact of varying batch sizes, sample numbers, and client numbers.</p>
