<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We propose a federated learning (FL) in stratosphere (FLSTRA) system, where a high altitude platform station (HAPS) facilitates a large number of terrestrial clients to collaboratively learn a global model without sharing the training data. FLSTRA overcomes the challenges faced by FL in terrestrial networks, such as slow convergence and high communication delay due to limited client participation and multi-hop communications. HAPS leverages its altitude and size to allow the participation of more clients with line-of-sight (LOS) links and the placement of a powerful server. However, handling many clients at once introduces computing and transmission delays. Thus, we aim to obtain a delay-accuracy trade-off for FLSTRA. Specifically, we first develop a joint client selection and resource allocation algorithm for uplink and downlink to minimize the FL delay subject to the energy and quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Second, we propose a communication and computation resource-aware (CCRA-FL) algorithm to achieve the target FL accuracy while deriving an upper bound for its convergence rate. The formulated problem is non-convex; thus, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FLSTRA system, compared to terrestrial benchmarks, in terms of FL delay and accuracy.</p>

A highly adaptive, real-time, intelligent, privacy-preserving, and self-evolving mechanism seems necessary for the next generation of wireless networks to respond to these varying demands and requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The decentralized machine learning (ML) framework has recently gained attention as an efficient solution to enable end-to-end intelligent and real-time decision-making in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In particular, the federated learning (FL) technique, developed by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, provides distributed intelligence for decentralized model training. The basic idea of FL is to invite the network’s active users with sufficient computation capability, i.e., equipped with computing modules such as CPU, GPU, and RAM, and data to participate in predicting or estimating network parameters, i.e., model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. FL has an inherent privacy-preserving mechanism that guarantees the data privacy of network users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Indeed, it allows collaborative model training without explicitly sharing local data. In FL, each user shares its model training parameters with a centralized server, which aggregates model training parameters after receiving them from all the users and broadcast the aggregated parameter back to the users. This cycle continues for several rounds (also known as the communication round) until convergence is achieved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL over terrestrial wireless networks has gained considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have been exploring various approaches to improve the performance of FL over wireless networks. Several research studies have been conducted to improve the performance of FL over wireless networks. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an asynchronous FL algorithm that selects a subset of clients based on their arrival order to be aggregated at the FL server, thereby improving communication efficiency. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors investigate energy-efficient transmission and computation resource allocation for FL over wireless communication networks. They formulate the joint learning and communication problem as an optimization problem to minimize energy consumption under a latency constraint and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) aided FL, in which an FL server simultaneously broadcasts the global model and provides wireless power transfer to wireless devices, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the system. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors considered FL with multiple edge-servers and accelerated the training by utilizing the clients located in the overlapping areas among different edge-servers. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a novel hierarchical FL framework where model aggregation can be partially migrated from the cloud to edge-servers.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The existing methods discussed have demonstrated significant improvements in the performance of FL over terrestrial wireless networks. Nevertheless, certain challenges still persist, including limitations on the number of participants, heterogeneous wireless environments, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel failures, and heterogeneous client computing resources. Research continues to address these challenges. In terrestrial networks, due to limited coverage and network resources such as bandwidth, client availability instability, and channel failures, only a portion of clients can participate in each FL round reliably <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Considering the iterative nature of FL, limiting the number of participants often results in a high computation delay and low training accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, for an FL system in terrestrial settings usually, multiple base stations (BSs) are employed as a relay to communicate with the server in the cloud server, and since the raw data is distributed across the edge devices in the access network, there are multi-hop wireless links thereby FL suffers from inevitable high communication delay. FL delay issues are studied in current literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and the efficiency of existing approaches degrades with the communication delay. Hence, stringent delay requirements render the centralized configurations of FL in terrestrial networks impractical for forthcoming applications, such as smart grids, autonomous vehicles, e-health, and augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.3" class="ltx_p">In order to address the challenges associated with traditional network architectures, innovative designs that can provide improved coverage and more reliable communication channels are required. One potential solution is the use of non-terrestrial platforms for FL, which can offer a more efficient and dependable means of communication in situations where traditional terrestrial base stations are limited in their coverage or communication reliability. However, it is important to note that the selection of an appropriate platform will depend on a variety of factors, and non-terrestrial platforms may not be suitable or feasible for all scenarios. With the limited coverage and environment-dependent communication reliability offered by terrestrial base stations, the use of a non-terrestrial platform like the high altitude platform station (HAPS) seems promising <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In fact, HAPS has recently been proposed as a potential candidate for 6G networks, which aim to provide ubiquitous communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. HAPS can operate at the stratospheric altitude of around <math id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math> km, providing strong line-of-sight (LOS) communications and wide coverage, with a radius ranging between <math id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="50" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">50</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1">50</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">50</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="500" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">500</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1">500</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS2.p2.3.m3.1c">500</annotation></semantics></math> km <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. HAPS has a large payload, which allows for hosting robust communication, computing and storage equipment, and long-lasting batteries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Given these advantages, HAPS can reliably communicate with a massive number of users and involve them as participants in the FL process.
In addition, it is expected that HAPS-enabled FL can achieve faster convergence and better model accuracy than its terrestrial counterparts due to the improvement in wireless channel quality and the participation of a large number of users in the FL training process. Recently, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the strategic position of HAPS is leveraged for fast and efficient FL for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. Essentially, HAPS is introduced to facilitate the global aggregation of local models received by high-speed orbiting satellite clients. In contrast, our work focuses on an FL system that uses a single HAPS as a server to facilitate collaborative learning among a large number of terrestrial clients. As a result, our approach is designed to cater to a larger number of terrestrial clients, while FedHAP is designed to cater to satellites that are moving. This fundamental difference in the network architecture leads to distinct design and optimization challenges, which we address in our work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In fact, the integration of FL into HAPS networks can offer potential use cases. For example, in the smart city context, HAPS can be utilized for traffic management and surveillance, where FL models can be trained on data collected from sensors and cameras across the city. Autonomous vehicles and drones can also benefit from FL over HAPS networks for real-time decision-making based on local data. In the healthcare sector, FL over HAPS networks can be utilized for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis, where privacy-preserving FL models can be trained on patient data collected from wearable devices distributed in wide geographical regions and sent to HAPS for aggregation. In augmented reality and virtual reality applications, FL over HAPS networks can enable real-time processing of large amounts of data collected from sensors and cameras to create large-scale immersive experiences. Moreover, FL over HAPS networks has the potential to provide more efficient and reliable solutions for various use cases. In the case of autonomous vehicles, the use of HAPS networks can facilitate better hand-off between base stations, enabling more efficient and reliable communication during the hand-off process. Furthermore, HAPS networks can provide a platform for large-scale FL systems over wide geographical scales, which is especially relevant for use cases such as disaster response, where a large number of participants may be spread over a wide area.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions can hinder convergence speed in FL and negatively impact accuracy even with a large number of participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, a novel mechanism is required to control the number of selected clients based on their data distributions. For instance, in healthcare applications, different hospitals may have vastly different patient demographics and medical conditions, leading to non-IID data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Our proposed mechanism optimizes the selection of clients to achieve the best possible balance between FL delay/convergence speed and accuracy, even in highly non-IID scenarios. By carefully controlling the number of selected clients, the accuracy of the FL model can be significantly improved while minimizing the end-to-end FL delay. Our study is the first to propose a joint participant selection and resource allocation design strategy in the context of a HAPS-enabled FL system, considering both delay and accuracy perspectives.

It is important to note that our proposed framework is applicable to any HAPS, but we focus on the stratospheric platform in this paper to illustrate its unique features and advantages, such as large coverage areas, stable and long-duration flight, and line-of-sight communication channels. Nevertheless, the framework is easily extendable to other types of HAPS with varying altitudes and coverage areas. The analysis and solutions presented in this paper are independent of the specific type of HAPS used, making the framework adaptable to different HAPS based on application requirements.</p>

FedAvg consists of alternating between a number of local gradient updates at clients, followed by a model averaging update at the server. Specifically, CCRA-FL uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer to generate local updates on each client. One disadvantage of batch gradient descent is that it performs redundant computations for large datasets by recomputing gradients for similar examples before each parameter update. SGD, on the other hand, eliminates this redundancy by performing one update at a time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. This makes SGD usually much faster than gradient descent and more suitable for large-scale datasets where computational efficiency is crucial. Further, in the CCRA-FL algorithm, the FedAvg parameters are optimized by solving the network resource optimization problem, which is developed in Section III, subject to communication and computation constraints.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Under the assumptions mentioned above, we present an upper bound on the convergence rate of the CCRA-FL algorithm in Theorem 1. Specifically, Theorem 1 provides an upper bound on the difference between the final loss of the CCRA-FL algorithm and the optimal global model. This difference represents an upper bound on the convergence rate of the FL system and is a commonly used metric for measuring the performance of such systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. It is worth noting that the loss function for the optimal global model is always less than or equal to the loss function for any global model since the optimal global model is the one that minimizes the global loss function. Hence, the difference between the final and optimal loss in Theorem 1 is always positive, representing the upper bound on the convergence rate of the CCRA-FL algorithm.

However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased utilization of network resources, higher delay, and more energy consumption. It is important to note that this dependency on the number of selected clients is unique to HAPS-based FL, as it is a result of its large footprint, providing the luxury of choosing different numbers of participants for each round of communication.</p>

effects and follows the Rician block fading model. We adopt a block fading channel model where channel gains are constant within a communication round but vary independently from round to round. The channel variation across rounds is characterized by the Rician model, which captures small-scale fading, and the average path loss, which accounts for large-scale fading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

The HAPS server can adapt its data rate by adjusting its broadcasting power according to the channel quality of the selected clients. This is achieved by adapting the data rate to the client with the worst instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, the corresponding instantaneous achievable downlink rate at each communication or global FL round can be determined as</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ FLSTRA: Federated Learning in Stratosphere" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and the intrinsic large footprint of HAPS, a massive number of accessible clients can be invited to the FLSTRA process through single-hop communications, thus leading to a higher FL convergence rate. Moreover, Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ FLSTRA: Federated Learning in Stratosphere" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> indicates a trade-off between the communication (and computation) efficiency and the FL convergence rate. Hence, in this work, we aim to improve the FL convergence rate by optimizing the number of selected clients and optimizing the resources while minimizing the end-to-end FL delay at every communication round. This delay includes both communication and computation times at both uplink and downlink at each communication round. In this section, we first formulate the end-to-end delay minimization problem for FLSTRA. Secondly, due to the non-convexity of the corresponding problem, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve it.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed FLSTRA framework for single HAPS can be extended to a multi-HAPS scenario for FL where huge databases are located geographically far apart. Consider a scenario in which a network of HAPSs covers a set of unique geographical areas where each HAPS employs Algorithm 1 for FL. Each HAPS, after learning the area-specific global model, exchanges its model parameters with other HAPS to learn a final global model. To generate a final global model, HAPSs need to cooperate with each other such that all the area-specific global model parameters of HAPS must be aggregated. The aggregation can be performed in a decentralized fashion. As a result, a final global model is available in all geographical areas without sharing or compromising the huge databases. The FLSTRA can be extremely useful in applications such as self-driving vehicles, modern healthcare, and smart cities, where independent databases can be located in several large cities. To implement the FLSTRA for multi-HAPS scenarios, Algorithm 1 can be conveniently used at each HAPS. To arrive at a final global model, however, we need to develop an end-to-end decentralized, resource-aware inter-HAPS learning algorithm that minimizes delay.</p>

The term ”radio resources” encompasses a range of available wireless communication resources, such as transmit power, bandwidth, and computational capacity, that are utilized by the clients to transmit their local model updates to the HAPS. The optimization of radio resources enables the clients to better utilize the available wireless resources and improves the efficiency of the FL process. Furthermore, it is important to note that in this algorithm, the FL server is co-located with the terrestrial cloud server, which further enhances the processing and computational capabilities of the system.</p>

The increase in the delay trend of all algorithms is due to two main reasons. Firstly, as the client participation increases the HAPS server needs to process an increased number of data; thus, computing delay increases. Secondly, the allocated bandwidth among the clients decreases with the increasing number of selected clients. Consequently, the uploading rate reduces and the uploading time increases. However, the proposed algorithm for FLSTRA has the lowest increase in the delay trend. Specifically, compared with the TERR-FL with RAN-SEL algorithm, the proposed CCRA-FL algorithm shows a decrease up to <math id="S4.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p6.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mo id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p6.2.m2.1.1.2">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p6.2.m2.1c">20\%</annotation></semantics></math> in end-to-end FL delay behaviour due to the presence of LOS link and the single-hop communication between clients and the HAPS server.</p>

However, the issue of bad channel quality is mitigated in the proposed CCRA-FL algorithm by employing the client selection strategy (i.e., step-2 in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Proof. ‣ II-B Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model ‣ FLSTRA: Federated Learning in Stratosphere" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

The former may be preferable when many clients are available, but each has very limited upload bandwidth which is a setting common in practice.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduced a novel idea of FLSTRA, which leverages the unique features of HAPS that allows large-scale FL. FLSTRA improves convergence rate and model accuracy but also increases delay. Hence, we developed a CCRA-FL algorithm with the aim to achieve the delay-accuracy trade-off. Particularly, we formulated a delay minimization problem to jointly optimize the communication and computation resource allocation (including uplink and downlink resources), client selection, and FL parameters. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decomposed it into four sub-problems and solved it in an iterative fashion. For some of the sub-problems, we also derived closed-form solutions. Our simulation results showed that to achieve the same level of model accuracy, the FLSTRA system significantly reduces the FL delay compared to the terrestrial benchmarks. Moreover, the proposed CCRA-FL algorithm for the FLSTRA is shown to be tolerant to HAPS undesirable displacement. Further, studying the impact of data distribution (i.e., non-IIDness level) on HAPS-enabled FL systems with more complex and larger datasets, such as CINIC-10 and CIFAR-10, and more sophisticated channel models is an interesting future direction. Additionally, considering multi-antenna devices as well as optimizing the 3D placement and beamforming of the HAPS server as part of the problem formulation will lead to improved performance of the FL system and reduction of the total end-to-end delay.</p>
