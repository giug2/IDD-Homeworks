<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</em> (FL) has recently emerged as a promising technology to enable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed mobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination of an edge server. To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL, <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</em> allows a large number of mobile devices to concurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property of wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model aggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among all devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">relay-assisted cooperative FL</em> scheme to effectively address the straggler issue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively assist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The nature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints that are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems. Moreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the optimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an alternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay operation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in a single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller error than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and the relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical insights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive numerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art schemes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the proliferation of mobile devices, such as smartphones, wearable devices, and sensors, mobile data traffic is growing at an unprecedented rate. The massive amounts of mobile data stimulate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge of wireless networks and trigger the emergence of a new paradigm termed <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge intelligence</em> (EI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, including edge learning and edge inference. With the support of mobile edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, EI pushes the training and inference processes of AI models from central cloud servers to the network edge, i.e., edge servers and mobile devices. Due to the close proximity and fast access to data sources, EI significantly reduces network bandwidth/energy costs and improves privacy preservation.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a promising framework to achieve edge learning by exploiting the increasingly powerful computational capabilities of mobile devices. Under the coordination of an edge server, e.g., a base station (BS) or a wireless access point (AP), FL enables mobile devices to collaboratively train a shared model without transmitting the raw data to the edge server. Specifically, the edge server shares a global model with mobile devices for distributed on-device training using their local data. Then, the mobile devices upload their local model updates to the edge server to update the global model as a weighted sum of the local models. Compared with traditional centralized learning approaches that collect all data at a central server, FL avoids prohibitive data transmission delay and potential privacy disclosure. Nonetheless, the communication cost remains the main bottleneck in FL since the learning process critically relies on iterative model exchanges between the edge server and the distributed mobile devices over limited radio resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To relieve the communication bottleneck in FL, over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> has been introduced to support concurrent model uploading over the same radio resources by exploiting the signal-superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. With proper pre-equalization and transmit power control at the mobile devices, the local models received at the edge server are aligned as a linear combination that combats the wireless fading and achieves the desired weighted sum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Unlike conventional orthogonal multiple access schemes that allocate orthogonal channels to multiple mobile devices for independent transmissions, the required bandwidth or communication latency of over-the-air computation is independent of the number of devices, significantly enhancing the system scalability and improving the communication efficiency. Despite the above advantages, over-the-air model aggregation inevitably suffers from distortion caused by communication noise and wireless channel fading. To align the uploaded local model updates at the edge server, the devices with better channels have to lower the transmit power, making the aggregation error dominated by the devices with weak channels, i.e., the communication stragglers. Existing work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> avoided large model aggregation errors by excluding the stragglers from concurrent model uploading. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a truncated-based power control approach to discard devices with deep fading channels. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors considered joint device selection and beamforming design to maximize the number of selected devices under a target mean-square-error (MSE) requirement. However, discarding devices from training often decreases the number of exploited training data, which inevitably slows down the FL convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the straggler issue and avoid potential learning performance loss, an alternative approach is not to exclude the communication stragglers but to enhance their communication qualities by advanced communication technologies. For example, relay-assisted communication has been a cost-effective technique to combat the effects of channel fading in wireless communications systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Specifically, we can deploy a set of relays as intermediate nodes to cooperatively assist data exchanges between the mobile devices and the AP, i.e., the edge server, which extends the coverage of the AP and enhances the transmission reliability of the devices far away from the AP. Inspired by this, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> built a relay network to improve the energy efficiency in FL, where the mobile devices cooperatively form a relay network to help each other upload the model updates to the AP. Recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a two-tier relay-assisted FL framework and designed a partially synchronized parallel mechanism, where the models and local gradients are transmitted simultaneously and aggregated at relay nodes. Note that Refs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> assume that each device only connects to one relay node and cannot leverage the benefits of the <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cooperative diversity</em> of relay networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> exploited the cooperative diversity with multiple relays for over-the-air computation and proposed a hierarchical communication framework to minimize the communication MSE. Nonetheless, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> considered a general over-the-air computation task and did not examine the effectiveness of the design in FL systems. More importantly, similarly to the relay-assisted design in conventional communication systems, the above work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> assumes that the devices do not transmit to the edge server directly. Instead, the local model uploading in each communication round is divided into two phases. The devices transmit their model information to the relays in the first phase, and rely on the relays to forward the information to the server in the second phase. This restriction, however, leads to sub-optimal learning performance in FL systems, as the AP fails to exploit the information carried in the direct transmission by the devices. Notice that the signals received at the AP from multiple transmitters can be coherently aligned as a weighted sum for over-the-air model aggregation. Therefore, with proper configuration of device-side and relay-side pre-equalization, the AP can aggregate the signals received from the mobile devices and the relays across the two time slots to achieve cooperative diversity gain. Such cooperation of devices and relays can significantly enhance the performance of over-the-air model aggregation, especially when the relay-only design is insufficient. Notably, the design of the device-relay cooperative system requires joint optimization of the equalization factors at the devices, the relays, and the server.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate the design of the relay-assisted cooperative FL system. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Relay-Assisted Cooperative Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the system comprises an AP, a set of half-duplex relays, and a set of mobile devices. The devices upload the local model updates to the AP with the assistance of the relays. In particular, the relays adopt the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy to assist the devices for over-the-air model aggregation in a cooperative manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the cooperative diversity of devices and relays for FL model aggregation. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel two-phase AF-relay-assisted cooperative model aggregation framework to exploit the cooperative diversity and enhance the communication efficiency in FL systems. Specifically, in the first phase of local model uploading, the devices concurrently transmit their local model updates to both the relays and the AP. In the second phase, the devices and the relays simultaneously send the local model updates and the amplified received signals, respectively, to the AP. We then analytically derive the model aggregation error as a function of the transceiver design in the relay-assisted FL system.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the FL convergence, we investigate the joint optimization of the pre-equalization scalars at the devices/relays and the receive scalars at the AP to minimize the model aggregation error. The joint optimization problem is challenging because of the strong coupling among the variables. We propose an effective algorithm based on alternating optimization to alternately optimize the transmit scalars at the devices, the relaying scalars, and the receive scalars at the AP. This allows us to solve the problem in polynomial time by deriving analytical solutions of the relaying scalars and the receive scalars at the AP.</p>

The analysis provides a useful guideline on how to deploy the relays in FL systems so that the relay assistance becomes beneficial.</p>

In particular, the proposed scheme achieves a smaller model aggregation error and higher learning accuracy, and performs very close to the ideal case with error-free communication channels. Moreover, the proposed scheme is more robust to the change of the transmit power, the locations, and the number of relays thanks to the cooperative diversity harvested from the relays and devices.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose that the relays are half-duplex, implying that they cannot transmit and receive at the same time. Correspondingly, we divide the local model uploading in each communication round into two phases. In the first phase, the devices concurrently transmit the model signals to both the relays and the AP over one radio resource block. In the second phase, the devices and the relays respectively send the model signals and the amplified received signals to the AP over another radio resource block. Since the transmission time of each symbol is fixed, the duration of each communication round in the proposed two-phase scheme is twice that in the scheme without relays in Section II-B. However, we will show in Section V that the proposed scheme still converges in a shorter time due to the relay assistance design.

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our analysis reports that inserting a relay, in general, does not necessarily give rise to performance improvement for over-the-air model aggregation. This is because the received signal at the relay in the first phase contains the communication noise in the device-relay channels; see (<a href="#S2.E15" title="In II-C Relay-Assisted Cooperative Model Aggregation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Relay-Assisted Cooperative Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>). This noise is coupled with the transmitted signals in the second phase as it is amplified together with the model signals, which potentially distorts the signal alignment at the AP. As detailed in the sequel, we show that the proposed single-relay-assisted cooperative FL achieves a smaller MSE than the one without relays, given that the transmit power at the relay is sufficiently large and the relay channels are sufficiently strong.</p>

That is, when the transmitted signals are received by either the relay or the AP, the minimum received SNR at the relay from the devices should be no less than that at the AP. On the other hand, the condition in (<a href="#S4.E45" title="In Theorem IV.1 ‣ IV Performance Analysis on the Single-Relay Scenario ‣ Relay-Assisted Cooperative Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">45</span></a>) guarantees that in the second phase the signal transmitted from the relay to the AP achieves a sufficiently high SNR so that the additional noise in the AF operation does not impair the final model aggregation. The combination of these two conditions assures that the relay does improve the model aggregation accuracy in our design. Note that the relay transmit power is typically larger than the device transmit power. Therefore, the conditions in (<a href="#S4.E44" title="In Theorem IV.1 ‣ IV Performance Analysis on the Single-Relay Scenario ‣ Relay-Assisted Cooperative Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">44</span></a>) and (<a href="#S4.E45" title="In Theorem IV.1 ‣ IV Performance Analysis on the Single-Relay Scenario ‣ Relay-Assisted Cooperative Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">45</span></a>) can be easily met by placing the relay at an intermediate position between the devices and the AP so that the average channel condition of each relaying link is better than that of the corresponding direct link.</p>

We see that the baseline without relays suffers a large aggregation error in this case. As the training proceeds, the accumulated aggregation error leads to an increasingly inaccurate global model in this scheme, which degrades the test accuracy. Thanks to the effect of relaying, the baseline in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> achieves a relatively smaller NMSE, but it still suffers from a low convergence rate.

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The above simulation results show that our relay-assisted scheme has significant performance gains in the low-to-intermediate SNR regime.

The baseline in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> achieves significant performance improvement when the single relay is close to the AP, but the test accuracy tends to decrease as the single relay is farther away from the AP and finally becomes worse than the scheme without relays. In contrast, the effect of the relay location on the test accuracy of the proposed scheme is marginal and almost negligible. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed scheme is robust to the relay locations.</p>

Similar to the single-relay case, the conventional scheme suffers from accuracy degradation because of its large model aggregation error. As shown by the red and green curves, the relays help overcome such an issue. Moreover, compared with the baseline in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, our method further improves the learning accuracy by exploiting the cooperation of the devices and the relays.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel relay-assisted cooperative model aggregation framework in FL systems and studied the transceiver design in this framework. We then formulated an optimization problem to jointly optimize the transmit scalars at the devices and relays and the de-noising receive scalars at the AP for model aggregation error minimization. We proposed an alternating minimization algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex problem with low complexity. Moreover, we rigorously analyzed the performance of the proposed relay-assisted cooperative FL design in a single-relay case and derived conditions on the relay such that our scheme achieves a smaller model aggregation error than the conventional scheme without relaying. The analysis provides a useful guideline on relay deployment to ensure beneficial relay assistance. Extensive simulations show that the proposed design achieves more accurate model aggregation and higher accuracy than the existing schemes. Furthermore, the proposed design is robust to the choices of the transmit power, the locations, and the number of relays as it exploits the cooperative diversity among the relays and devices.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we conclude the paper with some interesting future directions of relay-assisted cooperative FL. First, the proposed cooperative FL scheme can be extended to systems with full-duplex relays, where the relays can simultaneously transmit and receive. In this case, we need to address new challenges, such as self-interference cancellation at the relays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and additional model aggregation error caused by the delay in relaying the model signals. To this end, new designs on transceivers and relaying operation are needed to incorporate full-duplex relaying into cooperative FL. Second, it is challenging to extend the single-cell FL system to multi-cell communication systems as it requires further investigations on effective inter-cell interference mitigation as well as the relaying design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Moreover, although the proposed relay-assisted design effectively reduces the model aggregation error, the proposed relaying operation inevitably amplifies and forwards the communication noise it has received. We shall investigate how to exploit de-noising techniques, such as relay-side decompression, to further improve the performance of relay-assisted FL.</p>
