<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Data is the lifeblood of the modern world, forming a fundamental part of AI, decision-making, and research advances.
With increase in interest in data, governments have taken important steps towards a regulated data world, drastically impacting data sharing and data usability and resulting in massive amounts of data confined within the walls of organizations.
While synthetic data generation (SDG) is an appealing solution to break down these walls and enable data sharing, the main drawback of existing solutions is the assumption of a trusted aggregator for generative model training.
Given that many data holders may not want to, or be legally allowed to, entrust a central entity with their raw data, we propose a framework for collaborative and private generation of synthetic tabular data from distributed data holders.
Our solution is general, applicable to any marginal-based SDG, and provides input privacy by replacing the trusted aggregator with secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols and output privacy via differential privacy (DP).
We demonstrate the applicability and scalability of our approach for the state-of-the-art select-measure-generate SDG algorithms MWEM+PGM and AIM.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data, i.e. artificial data generated using a purpose-built synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to share microdata while mitigating privacy concerns. Synthetic data generation (SDG) with differential privacy (DP)
has received considerable attention from the research community (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Jordon et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; McKenna et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Tao et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and references therein). This generated data fits any data processing workflow designed for the original data,
while providing formal privacy guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Tabular data is ubiquitous in many domains ranging from healthcare, to humanitarian action, education, and socioeconomic studies Differentially private synthetic tabular data can be used for machine learning tasks and data analysis, as well as enable answering an arbitrary number of statistical queries. While many methods have been proposed in the literature to generate differentially private synthetic tabular data (DP-SD), such as GAN-based (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jordon et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Xu et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>) and marginal-based (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McKenna et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>) approaches, benchmarking studies have shown that marginal-based synthetic data generators often generate high quality tabular data with strong privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tao et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. These marginal-based synthesizers often follow the common template of ‘select-measure-generate’ to generate synthetic data. The ‘select’ step involves choosing which marginals to measure from the data. The ‘measure’ step adds noise to perturb the measured marginals to preserve privacy. Finally, the ‘generate’ step employs algorithms to estimate a data distribution from the perturbed marginal measurements, and to sample synthetic data that closely preserves these measured marginals.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Problem.</span> Existing SDG approaches operate in <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the centralized paradigm</span>, i.e. they assume that the real data needed to train the synthesizer resides with one data holder, or, if the data originates from different data holders, that the latter are able to send their data to a trusted aggregator who in turn will use it as input for SDG algorithms. Large amounts of valuable data however are under the control of data holders (companies, hospitals, biomedical research institutes etc.) who cannot show their data to each other or to a central aggregator without raising privacy concerns. This is the bottleneck that we address, namely <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to generate synthetic data based on the combined data from distributed data holders who are not able to disclose their data</span>.
This includes data that is horizontally distributed, such as data across different hospitals who each have their own patients, as well as data that is vertically distributed such as in scenarios where a patient’s data is distributed across multiple entities (hospitals, companies, labs, etc.). In addition to the cross-silo scenarios described above, our proposed solution would also make a scenario practical where millions of users (patients) could provide their data to produce a synthetic dataset in a way that private, individual data would never be exposed in plaintext (i.e. without being encrypted) to any entity – practically implementing a ‘synthetic data as a service’ model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There is a substantial gap in the literature on solutions for SDG from distributed data sources.
While approaches such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xin et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>; Behera et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which are based on federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, seem to provide a viable solution for this problem, with the caveat that they work either for horizontal (HFL) or for vertical (VFL) data partitioning, not both. Moreover, they rely on a single honest-but-curious aggregator, hence a single point of failure. Decentralized paradigms such as peer-to-peer solutions that remove the need of central entity, adapt approaches based on local differential privacy (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kasiviswanathan et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> or distributed differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite> which are known to result in utility loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pasquini et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Ramesh et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a></cite> proposed to use secure multi-party computation combined with specialized hardware (a trusted execution environment) to generate synthetic data from distributed sources.To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no solutions that can generate differentially private synthetic data from distributed data sources using marginal-based synthesizers that work for (a) arbitrary data partitioning (horizontal, vertical, or mixed), (b) provide utility at par with that of the centralized paradigm (c) do not rely on a single trusted entity and (d) do not need specialized hardware.</p>

We observe that SDG techniques based on the ‘select-measure-generate’ template only need to perform computations on the private data in the ‘select’ and ‘measure’ steps. The outputs of these
steps are protected with DP guarantees.

Following this observation, it is sensible to (1) encrypt the data, (2) carry out the ‘select’ and ‘measure’ steps with differential privacy in secure multi-party computation protocols (DP-in-MPC) over the data while it stays encrypted, and (3) publish the perturbed marginals for consumption by the ‘generate’ step.

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.3" class="ltx_p">We capture this idea in a framework called <span id="S1.p7.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ CaPS: Collaborative and Private Synthetic Data Generation from Distributed Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) to generate differentially private synthetic tabular data from distributed data holders that works for any kind of data partitioning (horizontal, vertical, or mixed). <span id="S1.p7.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> uses MPC to provide <span id="S1.p7.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">input privacy</span> by replacing the trusted entity from the centralized paradigm with MPC servers. Unlike in the traditional central paradigm, these computing servers that execute the MPC protocols never see the private data of the data holders in an unencrypted manner. To provide <span id="S1.p7.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">output privacy</span> guarantees, <span id="S1.p7.3.5" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> uses differential privacy as in the centralized paradigm. The crucial difference however is that perturbations to provide DP are performed <span id="S1.p7.3.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">within</span> the MPC protocols,
effectively having the MPC servers simulate the role of a trusted entity implementing differential privacy mechanisms. This ‘DP-in-MPC’ approach achieves utility at par with the centralized paradigm as shown in our experiments.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.4" class="ltx_p">We designed <span id="S1.p8.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> to be modular. The individual algorithms for each of the select, measure, and generate steps can be replaced. Thus, the MPC protocols for the select and measure steps can be replaced or switched. This means that <span id="S1.p8.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> can be easily adapted to any SDG algorithm by simply replacing or designing the MPC protocols for the given select and measure steps. Moreover, the underlying MPC primitives in the protocols can also be replaced with primitives for different adversarial models and schemes or with much more efficient primitives in the future. To illustrate this, we apply <span id="S1.p8.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> to create privacy-preserving collaborative counterparts of the state-of-the-art SDG algorithms MWEM+PGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mckenna et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and AIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McKenna et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. We design MPC protocols for the select and measure steps of these algorithms and develop pipelines to generate tabular synthetic data. We evaluate these pipelines for performance, measuring runtime and communication cost. We assess the quality of the synthetic data by reporting the average workload error on benchmark datasets.
We also assess the utility of the generated synthetic data for downstream machine learning (ML) tasks by reporting AUC and F1 scores obtained with logistic regression and random forest models trained on the benchmark data. Our evaluations demonstrate that <span id="S1.p8.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> generates differentially private synthetic data of the same level of quality as in the centralized paradigm, while in addition providing input privacy, making it suitable for collaborative SDG from distributed data holders.

These servers run MPC protocols to jointly perform computations over the secret shares, in our case computations for generating synthetic data. As all computations are done over encrypted values, the servers do not learn the values of the inputs nor of intermediate results, i.e. MPC provides <span id="S2.p4.5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">input privacy</span>.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Threat Model.</span> MPC protocols are designed to prevent and detect attacks by an adversary corrupting one or more parties to learn private information or to cause the result of the computation to be incorrect. The adversary – which we assume to be static – can have different levels of adversarial power. In the <span id="S2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semi-honest</span> model, even corrupted parties follow the instructions of the protocol, but the adversary attempts to learn private information from the internal state of the corrupted parties and the messages that they receive.
MPC protocols that are secure against semi-honest or <span id="S2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“passive”</span> adversaries prevent such leakage of information. In the <span id="S2.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">malicious</span> adversarial model, the corrupted parties can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol specification. Providing security in the presence of malicious or <span id="S2.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“active”</span> adversaries, i.e. ensuring that no such adversarial attack can succeed, comes at a higher computational cost than in the passive case.
The protocols that we propose in Sec. <a href="#S3" title="3 CaPS: Collaborative and Private SDG ‣ CaPS: Collaborative and Private Synthetic Data Generation from Distributed Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> are sufficiently generic to be used in settings with passive or active adversaries. This is achieved by changing the underlying MPC scheme to align with the desired security setting. We evaluate our protocols in an honest-majority 3-party computing setting out of which at most one party can be corrupted (3PC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Araki et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Dalskov et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, an honest-majority 4-party computing setting with one corruption (4PC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dalskov et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and a dishonest-majority 2-party computation setting where each party can only trust itself (2PC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cramer et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

This is a direct optimization in a vertical distributed setting when the selected query is a 1-way marginal. However, the advantage of generating noise in MPC is that the noise is added in a correct and private manner, such that private inputs cannot be reconstructed back. One can also optimize the MPC primitives to generate the secret shares of noise as we consider in Protocol <a href="#alg5" title="Algorithm 5 ‣ 3.4 Measuring Answer to the Selected Query ‣ 3 CaPS: Collaborative and Private SDG ‣ CaPS: Collaborative and Private Synthetic Data Generation from Distributed Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

To measure the average time to generate synthetic data in CDP and <span id="S4.p5.8.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span>, we run experiments in a simulated environment on Azure D8ads_v5 8 vCPUs, 32Gib RAM.

For AIM, the vertical setup takes comparatively less time. This is because AIM requires computation of one-way marginals before the selection step, which can be done by the data holders in a vertical distributed scenario. In the horizontal setup, computation of one-way marginals has to be done in MPC, generating additional overhead in computation of marginals compared to the vertical setup.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, there are only a handful of works on generating synthetic data from multiple private data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xin et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>; Behera et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zhao et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Ramesh et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Ghavamipour et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. These methods either work only for a given data distribution scenario or rely on specialized hardware. In contrast with existing work, we focus on generating synthetic data with the “DP-in-MPC” paradigm for SDG algorithms that follow the select-measure-generate template, in a manner that works for any arbitrary distribution and does not require specialized hardware. In the general modular framework that we have introduced to this end, one can
plug in other protocols from the MPC literature, including protocols for sampling noise, see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wei et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Pettai &amp; Laud, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Zhao et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.3" class="ltx_p">We introduced a general framework <span id="S6.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> that enables collaborative and private generation of tabular synthetic data based on real data from multiple data holders. <span id="S6.p1.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> follows the select-measure-generate template to generate synthetic data regardless of how the real data is distibuted among the data holders, i.e. horizontally, vertically, or mixed.
We leverage the idea of “DP-in-MPC” to provide input privacy by performing computations on secret shared (i.e. encrypted) data, and applying differential privacy mechanisms within MPC itself. Letting MPC servers emulate a trusted central entity allows us to provide the same level of output privacy and utility as in the centralized paradigm, however without having to sacrifice input privacy.
We demonstrated the applicability of <span id="S6.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">CaPS</span> for the state-of-the-art marginal based synthetic data generators AIM and MWEM+PGM. We consider generating synthetic data using “DP-in-MPC” for other data modalities and their state-of-the art generation algorithms as a future research direction.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Impact of our work</h2>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work advocates for responsible use of sensitive and private data while benefiting different tasks of data science. In our paper, we propose a general framework that generates synthetic data from multiple sources. We believe that synthetic data is a multi-advantageous solution for data sharing while mitigating privacy concerns. Our work contributes to generation of synthetic data based on training data from multiple private data sources, thereby improving the quality and diversity of generated data. We envision a scenario where our framework can be used to generate synthetic data in sensitive domains such as healthcare. Organizations can use the generated synthetic data to augment their local datasets, perform data imputations or train effective and fair ML models.
We build upon the existing state-of-the art algorithms to generate synthetic data. Our proposed framework is limited by the disadvantages and affects of these existing algorithms (such as fairness and robustness of generated synthetic data, and vulnerability to adversarial privacy attacks). Users must be aware of such limitations/disadvantages and validate the suitability of the algorithm to generate synthetic data when considering our framework. We additionally note that our framework provides privacy and utility at the cost of runtime and communication, so choosing the framework for time-sensitive scenarios is left to the user’s discretion.
In our experiments we use publicly available datasets thereby adhering to the ethical guidelines for data usage.
