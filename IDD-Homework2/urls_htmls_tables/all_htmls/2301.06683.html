<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The release of numerous chest x-ray datasets has spearheaded the development of deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, they have limited interoperability due to class-heterogeneity – a result of inconsistent labeling schemes and partial annotations. Therefore, it is challenging to leverage these datasets in aggregate to train models with a complete representation of abnormalities that may occur within the thorax. In this work, we propose surgical aggregation, a federated learning framework for aggregating knowledge from class-heterogeneous datasets and learn a model that can simultaneously predict the presence of all disease labels present across the datasets. We evaluate our method using simulated and real-world class-heterogeneous datasets across both independent and identically distributed (iid) and non-iid settings. Our results show that surgical aggregation outperforms current methods, has better generalizability, and is a crucial first step towards tackling class-heterogeneity in federated learning to facilitate the development of clinically-useful models using previously non-interoperable chest x-ray datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has revolutionized the field of radiology in recent years, especially for its utility in screening life-threatening conditions using chest x-rays (CXRs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As a result, numerous large-scale CXR datasets have been released for the purpose of training high-performing models with expert-level detection of diseases in the thorax <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since each dataset is curated at different sites using different acquisition parameters and image processing techniques, large-scale CXR datasets are heterogeneous and not independently and identically distributed (iid). Moreover, these datasets are <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">class-heterogeneous</em> due to inconsistent labeling schemes and partial annotations. In other words, each dataset focuses only on detecting a subset of findings that could be present in a patient and annotations present in one dataset may not be present in another – limiting their interoperability. For example, the NIH Chest X-ray 14 and CheXpert datasets contain 14 and 13 disease labels respectively, with only seven in common, making it challenging to leverage these datasets in aggregate to train large-scale models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Interoperability between these datasets is crucial as models trained on larger, diverse, multi-institutional datasets yield higher performance and better generalizability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In the context of bias and fairness, models trained on multi-institutional datasets tend to the least biased towards under-served patient populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Therefore, there is a critically unmet need to address interoperability between large-scale CXR datasets, in order to train clinically-useful models with a complete representation of abnormalities that may occur in the thorax – even with the presence of class-heterogeneity.</p>

In the aforementioned example, surgical aggregation can leverage the NIH and CheXpert datasets in aggregate to train a large-scale model that can simultaneously predict the presence of all 20 unique disease labels across both datasets – while performing as well as models trained individually on both datasets. We validate our framework by conducting a series of empirical experiments with varying levels of class- and data-heterogeneity to evaluate their stability using simulated iid datasets. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our framework in real-world settings using two large-scale non-iid datasets. Our main contributions are three-fold:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The prevalent approach to leverage knowledge from the myriad of CXR datasets is training models individually on each dataset. While they yield high-performance in isolation, individually trained models often do not generalize well in the real-world due to domain shift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Cohen <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> demonstrated that the poor generalizability of individually trained models stemmed from not just shift in imaging data, but also from shift in labels due to factors like inconsistent labeling schemes and clinical biases. Furthermore, this siloed approach would result in an ever increasing number of models as more datasets get curated in the future for novel tasks (e.g., detection of COVID-19).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Various groups have explored the idea of leveraging multiple datasets in aggregate to yield high-performing and highly-generalizable models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, aggregating multi-site data in a centralized training setup is impractical due to patient data privacy. Federated learning (FL) was proposed as promising collaborative learning paradigm to mitigate this problem. Consisting of a central server with multiple clients, FL can train a global model on distributed datasets by aggregating ”knowledge” (i.e., model weights) learned by local models at each client using a strategy like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. It has enabled training of large-scale models using medical imaging data distributed across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive patient data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, class- and data-heterogeneity pose a significant challenge to FL.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to data-heterogeneity, local models may learn features that differ significantly from each other (Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Surgical Aggregation: Federated Class-Heterogeneous Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Thus, different strategies have been proposed in literature for aggregating knowledge from non-iid datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, there is a significant gap in literature addressing class-heterogeneity. Most approaches focus on either detecting 1) the presence of an abnormality, or 2) the disease labels shared across all datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

However, this approach learns a multi-class classifier, i.e., the model can predict the presence of only one disease – even if other diseases may be present. Furthermore, an additional dataset is required for distillation at the central server.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the release of countless CXR datasets has spearheaded the utility of deep learning for expert-level detection of diseases in the thorax, the lack of interoperability due to class-heterogeneity has limited their utility beyond training ”narrowly” focused models. Therefore, there is a significant gap in literature for methods that address class-heterogeneity and enable training of large-scale models by leveraging non-interoperable datasets in aggregate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our results demonstrate that surgical aggregation enables interoperability between distributed class-heterogeneous datasets to collaboratively develop a global multi-task model. In the absence of class-heterogeneity, surgical aggregation performs on par with well-established approaches in literature. However, in the presence of class-heterogeneity, our method continues to maintain high-performance and performs on par with, or in some cases outperforms, the baselines. More importantly, in the presence of class-heterogeneity, surgical aggregation scales well across both iid and non-iid settings. On the other hand, existing methods fall short and scale poorly in non-iid settings. For example, while FL with partial loss is a close second in terms of performance with iid data, its performance significantly degrades with non-iid data. This is primarily due to feature shift between task-specific weights at each client as local updates from a client for non-local classes leads to client drift and degradation of performance on non-shared classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the selective aggregation of task-specific weights is critical to tackle class-heterogeneity in non-iid settings and is the crux of our method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Another advantage of surgical aggregation is its ability to learn a singular multi-task global model that can predict the complete set of classes observed in the network. In stark contrast, the PFL paradigm entails <math id="S6.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> clients learning <math id="S6.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> personalized models. While it is popular approach to tackle non-iid data, PFL has interesting implications in the clinical environment. First, each personalized model will yield different predictions for the same CXR, thus, raising the question of which model’s prediction should be trusted. Second, PFL emphasizes local optimization over generalization, thus making personalized models susceptible to poor generalizability on unseen data and shift in labeling schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These advantages enable surgical aggregation to not just facilitate greater collaboration between institutes focusing on different tasks in the same domain, but also enable the countless ”narrowly” focused datasets (e.g., those curated for competitions) to be leveraged to collectively train clinically-useful models with a complete representation of abnormalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite our results demonstrating the advantages of surgical aggregation, our work has certain limitations. First, surgical aggregation is designed primarily for multi-label classifiers and may not scale for medical image segmentation – a fundamentally different and more difficult problem to solve. Second, due to limited literature for class-heterogeneous settings in FL, there are no established benchmarks to compare our method against beyond external validation. Third, our method requires all clients to share the same architecture for the representation block, an important consideration for clients with different computational resources. Finally, the empirical experiments are conducted on a simulated FL setup – lacking validation in real-world FL networks. For future work, we intend to explore solutions for these limitations and further validate our framework for real-world applications.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Surgical aggregation is a crucial first step towards tackling class-heterogeneity in FL, especially between large-scale CXR datasets. Our results show that surgical aggregation can train high-performing models that simultaneously predict the presence of all disease labels present across the datasets and facilitate the development of highly-generalizable models using previously non-interoperable CXR datasets.</p>
