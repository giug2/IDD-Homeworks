<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Many application scenarios call for training a machine learning model among multiple participants. Federated learning (FL) was proposed to enable joint training of a deep learning model using the local data in each party without revealing the data to others. Among various types of FL methods, vertical FL is a category to handle data sources with the same ID space and different feature spaces. However, existing vertical FL methods suffer from limitations such as restrictive neural network structure, slow training speed, and often lack the ability to take advantage of data with unmatched IDs. In this work, we propose an FL method called self-taught federated learning to address the aforementioned issues, which uses unsupervised feature extraction techniques for distributed supervised deep learning tasks. In this method, only latent variables are transmitted to other parties for model training, while privacy is preserved by storing the data and parameters of activations, weights, and biases locally. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate and demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> technologies, many human-level intelligent applications empowered by AI have emerged, such as object recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, playing video games <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and playing Go <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To obtain a deep learning model with superior performance, a big dataset is one of the prerequisites in many applications. However, obtaining such a big dataset is a difficult task. The situation gets even worse for supervised tasks using labeled data since it may involve expensive human effort for labeling the data. It is very hard for a single party to gather enough training data. To avoid manually collecting all data by just one party, one may form a big dataset by combining the data and resources from distributed parties. Take health care as an example, data such as symptoms, medical records, and patient profiles can contribute to the AI medical diagnosis. However, different person may seek a doctor at different hospitals. Each hospital tends to keep the data locally, and thus the complete medical records are scattered. They may refuse to publish or share the data with others since personal and sensitive information may be revealed from the data and forbidden by rules and regulations. As a result, although combining the dataset may enhance the AI model, the data are still dispersed in different parties and forms data silos. Therefore, the isolated data problem and data privacy issues have to be carefully addressed for improving the AI model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many privacy-preserving computing technologies have been proposed to address the privacy issues in data sharing, namely, Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation.
Differential Privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> enables sharing general information of the dataset without leaking individuals information in the dataset. However, there is a trade-off between the security level and accuracy.
Homomorphic Encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is an encryption technique that allows computation to be performed over encrypted data without decryption. The decrypted result is equal to the results that are computed without any encryption. Thus, the encrypted data can be combined to form a large dataset without information leakage.
Secure Multi-Party Computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a method to enable jointly compute a function with input from different parties while the inputs are kept private.
However, the above technologies cannot entirely support privacy-preserving joint training of a neural network-based model with distributed data sources due to their high computational cost and limited tool chain support.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the data privacy issues in machine learning, Google introduced a privacy-preserving machine learning framework called federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, allowing different parties to jointly train a model without data sharing. Each party retains a copy of the model and trains the model using their local dataset. For each training iteration, only gradients are transmitted to other parties so that the parties cannot acquire the raw data from these parameters. This method is effective for parties with homogeneous data, i.e., the data with the same feature space. However, the feature space of the data stored in different parties may not always be the same. For example, a hospital may have a patient’s medical record while the smart wearing device keeps track of the heartbeat rate and blood pressure. The data in different parties can be heterogeneous such that sharing of model parameters using the aforementioned method is not applicable in these cases. Developing an efficient FL method for heterogeneous data remains challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, homomorphic encryption-based FL approaches are introduced to handle the heterogeneous data. In these approaches, a deep neural network is partitioned into two parts: feature extractor and classifier. Each guest party feeds their data to the feature extractor locally, and the encrypted outputs are provided to the classifier at the host party. The error and gradients are then computed based on the label data at the host. In the backward propagation stage, the encrypted gradients are sent back to the guests for their respective parameter updates. The intermediate results exchanged in different parties are homomorphicly encrypted or noise masked such that other parties cannot infer the raw data. However, these approaches suffer from some drawbacks. First, the design of the neural network structure is restricted due to the partitioning of the feature extractor and classifier in the guest and host, respectively. Second, the processing speed of these approaches is quite low due to the intensive homomorphic encryption and decryption among the parties. Finally, the data with unmatched IDs are discarded and wasted. Therefore, it is a promising research direction to develop a new FL approach that addresses the limitations for privacy-preserving multi-party machine learning problems with heterogeneous data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Consider the data is homogeneous, implying the feature spaces of data in different parties are the same. The learning task in this scenario can be categorized as horizontal federated learning. For example, two regional hospitals may have patient medical records in the same feature space. The group of the patient may be diverse so that the intersection of the dataset is small. In this case, combining the dataset is generally beneficial to the AI model training by increasing the number of samples. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, each party trains a local deep learning model using their local dataset and uploads the trained parameters to the server as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-A1 Horizontal Federated Learning ‣ II-A Federated Learning ‣ II Related Work ‣ Privacy-Preserving Self-Taught Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The server updates the global model by calculating the average of the parameters and broadcasts the updated global model to the parties in each iteration. Using this method, the global model is equivalent to being trained by all the data in the parties, while the data itself is stored locally without sharing to other parties. The only parameters sharing with the server are the gradients. The parties cannot infer the raw data based on gradients. Hence, the data privacy is preserved in this algorithm.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning is usually used to deal with heterogeneous data, which refers to the machine learning tasks where the data in the parties contain the same IDs, but different feature spaces. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a privacy-preserved machine learning framework based on homomorphic encryption is introduced. Based on the findings in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> extend the capability of the framework to support the scenario where the data and labels are distributed in different parties. The training of deep neural network carries a partly unencrypted and partly encrypted strategy between different parties to avoid learning on encrypted data directly. There are two stages in the training: forward propagation and backward propagation as shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-A2 Vertical Federated Learning ‣ II-A Federated Learning ‣ II Related Work ‣ Privacy-Preserving Self-Taught Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ II-A2 Vertical Federated Learning ‣ II-A Federated Learning ‣ II Related Work ‣ Privacy-Preserving Self-Taught Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, respectively. The former is responsible for forwarding the encrypted activations from the guests to the host, while the later is responsible for propagating the noise masked gradient to the guests for model update. The reason of encrypting or noise masking the intermediate information is that one may infer other’s data by stacking the information of activations, model weights, and gradients. Since the parties cannot get the unencrypted intermediate information, they cannot infer other’s data during the training process by using this approach. Hence, the data privacy issue is addressed by this approach.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated transfer learning is designed for the scenario where both the ID and feature space are different. The joint training without overlapping in either ID or feature space is different from the above-mentioned algorithms, and thus techniques in transfer learning are usually applied. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a secure feature mapping is used to transform the uncommon feature spaces of the parties into common ones before applying horizontal federated learning to the homogenized data. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> developed a federated transfer learning framework via model distillation to allow the parties to have their unique neural network model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors incorporate additively homomorphic encryption and secret sharing into the federated transfer learning framework for transferring knowledge from source to target domain. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a model called federated adversarial domain adaptation is proposed to transfer the learned knowledge in the domains of the parties to an unlabeled target domain while persevering the data privacy in each party. The target model parameters are updated from the aggregation of the gradients of the separately trained local model using a dynamic attention mechanism.</p>

Firstly, a flexible vertical federated learning framework will be developed for admitting any neural network models and training algorithms. Secondly, the framework will be homomorphic encryption free to enhance the processing speed while preserving data privacy. Finally, the framework should leverage non-overlapped and public data of individual parties during the training process.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by self-taught learning, we propose a vertical FL framework called self-taught federated learning (STFL), which uses unsupervised feature extraction for distributed supervised machine learning tasks. Self-taught learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a machine learning framework for supervised tasks that use random unlabeled data to enhance performance. The motivation of self-taught learning is that it is hard to collect a large number of labeled images for the supervised classification tasks. Therefore, it uses unlabeled random images to pre-train the model and obtains high-level features based on sparse coding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Then, the pre-trained activation functions are transferred to the model to compute the features for the classification task. Hence, the classification performance is significantly improved with the same amount of labeled data. We employ the same concept for high-level feature extraction using additional unlabeled data for vertical FL.</p>

It contains a neural network and encoders. The input data of host, neural network and label (in blue) are known to the host only while input data of guest and encoder (in red) are known to the corresponding guest only. Latent variables are the information shared from guest.
The detailed algorithm is shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ IV-A Self-Taught Federated Learning ‣ IV Methodology ‣ Privacy-Preserving Self-Taught Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
To preserve data privacy in the training process, each guest first trains a local encoder using their non-overlapped or public data based on feature extraction techniques such as variational autoencoder (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. We replace the high-level feature extraction technique from sparse coding in self-taught learning to VAE, which improves the security level. This reason will be provided in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Security Analysis ‣ IV Methodology ‣ Privacy-Preserving Self-Taught Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>. The guests then output the latent variables from the encoder of VAE instead of directly output the data to other parties for model training.
More specifically, the VAE has the following loss function to minimize the KL-divergence and the reconstruction error:</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">After training of the VAEs in the guests, the encoder can be used to encode the data to the latent space for joint training. The host and guests perform intersection protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to compute the intersecting ID set among the parties without leakage of the set information. Only the data with the intersected ID will be used in the joint training. For the host, it is responsible for designing the master model, such as the neural network structure based on the data structure of the parties. It trains the model using the guests’ input of latent variables and its own data with the same ID in each iteration. The training algorithm can be designed and implemented by the host while the guests only transmit latent variables from the encoder. The rest of the training is the same as common supervised learning. This algorithm preserves data privacy in each party as the raw data is not shared with others. The raw data cannot be inferred from the shared intermediate information.

For “cancer” dataset, FATE trained by all data has the highest accuracy while all other methods have a similar accuracy. From the experiments of using “cancer” dataset, we can see that STFL is robust to the data size since it contains very small (228) data samples for training the VAE as compared to other two large datasets.
For “payment” dataset, the centralized method trained with all data has the highest accuracy when compared to other methods. In general, most of the methods have similar accuracy except FATE has a lower accuracy. For “credit” dataset, the hierarchical method has the highest accuracy when compared to other methods. In general, the accuracy of all methods is similar. We can see that although STFL cannot achieve the highest accuracy, it is not the method with the lowest accuracy. It has similar accuracy with other state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, fixing the parameters in the guest’s network during training without gradient back-propagation does not significantly decrease its prediction accuracy since it has been pre-trained.</p>

For different datasets, the time is different since the data size of each dataset is different. The larger the dataset, the longer the required training time. FATE requires much more training time compared to STFL for the three datasets. The main reason is that FATE uses homomorphic encryption for the shared information, which is computationally expensive. On the other hand, STFL avoids using homomorphic encryption and use a self-trained encoder of VAE to transform features from the data to the latent space which can be computed in a much shorter time. Therefore, the computational time of STFL is much short than that of FATE.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL can facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing among data owners to enhance AI modeling and applications. However, state-of-the-art FL technologies for heterogeneous datasets suffer from extremely low training speed which is impractical for real-world applications. Inspired by self-taught learning, we propose a new FL method for heterogeneous datasets called STFL to exploit unsupervised feature extraction techniques for the federated learning with heterogeneous datasets while preserving data privacy. Experiments on different datasets were preformed to evaluate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that STFL dramatically reduces the required training speed while maintaining a similar level of prediction accuracy in the experiments.</p>
