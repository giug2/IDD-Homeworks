<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) among teenagers has led to significant misuse and safety concerns. To identify risks and understand parental controls challenges, we conducted a content analysis on Reddit and interviewed 20 participants (seven teenagers and 13 parents). Our study reveals a significant gap in parental awareness of the extensive ways children use GAI, such as interacting with character-based chatbots for emotional support or engaging in virtual relationships. Parents and children report differing perceptions of risks associated with GAI. Parents primarily express concerns about data collection, misinformation, and exposure to inappropriate content. In contrast, teenagers are more concerned about becoming addicted to virtual relationships with GAI, the potential misuse of GAI to spread harmful content in social groups, and the invasion of privacy due to unauthorized use of their personal data in GAI applications. The absence of parental control features on GAI platforms forces parents to rely on system-built controls, manually check histories, share accounts, and engage in active mediation. Despite these efforts, parents struggle to grasp the full spectrum of GAI-related risks and to perform effective real-time monitoring, mediation, and education. We provide design recommendations to improve parent-child communication and enhance the safety of GAI use.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has swiftly become a vital component of the digital ecosystem, significantly transforming user interactions with technology and opening up new avenues for creativity and innovation. Examples like ChatGPT, which enhances content creation with advanced text generation, and DALL-E, which creates realistic images from text descriptions, illustrate GAI’s impact on digital media and design.
This widespread adoption is particularly evident among younger age groups. A study by the UK’s communications regulator Ofcom finds that 79% of online 13-17 year-olds and 40% of 7-12 year-olds in the UK are using generative AI tools and services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. As young generations rapidly adopt emerging technologies, it is crucial to consider the potential risks and harms these technologies may bring, including concerns related to discrimination, privacy, and safety. Particularly, the usage of GAI by teens and young adults is closely linked to their mental health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly understand their usage patterns and evaluate the current protective measures. By doing so, we can develop and implement more effective precautions to safeguard their well-being as they engage with these technologies.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Previous studies have examined the risk perceptions and controls of parents across various technologies and applications, including Virtual Reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>, IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>, social media platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite>, and gaming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. These studies identified both common and unique risks in various contexts, including explicit content, addiction, cyberbullying, and harassment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. Subsequent research has also highlighted parents’ mediation strategies, such as monitoring, restriction, and active mediation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>. Additionally, studies have pointed out the trade-offs that exist between parental control and children’s autonomy. Since children can benefit from low-risk experiences to develop their ability to identify and manage risks independently in the future, defining the boundaries of parental control and ensuring the right balance remain challenging in children’s risk management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. The motivation for our research stems from the need to better understand both parents’ and children’s safety perceptions and coping strategies within the context of Generative AI (GAI), an emerging technology with unique risks and opportunities. We focus on three research questions:</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p3.1.1">Findings.</span> We conducted reddit data analysis and semi-structured interview with seven children and 13 parents to answer these research questions. For RQ1, our findings reveal that child participants use Generative AI (GAI) in diverse and unexpected ways, far beyond the educational or experimental purposes that parent participants assume. Interviews with child participants and analysis of data from Reddit discussions indicate that teenagers often integrate GAI into their daily routines. They use GAI as an friend or confidant, providing emotional support and companionship. Additionally, teenagers reported using GAI to enhance their social interactions, such as incorporating bots into group chats to facilitate conversations and simulate social dynamics. Our research identified a primary reason for this gap: the diverse sources from which children are informed and introduced to AI. Besides their parents, children learn about GAI through influencer videos, targeted advertisements on social media, and peer recommendations. These sources often introduce them to new and experimental GAI platforms, which typically carry more risks compared to more established ones. Furthermore, both parents and children hold significant misconceptions about GAI’s data collection, sharing, and processing practices.
<br class="ltx_break"/>For RQ2, we uncovered significant security and privacy concerns associated with children’s use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which parents frequently overlook due to unawareness of the varied interactions children have with these technologies. Teenagers expressed specific worries about GAI in social contexts. They were concerned about becoming overly dependent on virtual relationships with chatbots, which could exacerbate their challenges in forming real-life social connections. Additionally, they noted the potential misuse of GAI in group chats to create distressing or harassing content. Moreover, child participants shared concerns regarding the unauthorized use of their personal data to create GAI chatbots or memes, and the risk of strangers misusing their online images to glean personal information. They also encountered NSFW chatbots promoted by peers and social media, and some even created chatbots to spread harmful content, such as racist remarks. Parents, however, often underestimated these risks. While they were aware of GAI collecting basic information like names and locations, they did not fully appreciate the extent of sensitive data their children might share with GAI perceived as friends or confidants. This data could include details of personal traumas, medical records, and private aspects of their social and sexual lives.
<br class="ltx_break"/>For RQ3, leading GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT and Meta AI, offer limited protections, primarily focusing on banning explicit content and requiring users to be 13 or older. The absence of comprehensive parental control features on these platforms compels parents to rely on often ineffective tools for real-time mediation. These include using general parental control tools like iOS Family Control and Google Family Link, engaging in active mediation through open communication and setting consensual rules, and monitoring their children’s GAI usage by sharing accounts or checking interaction histories. However, these strategies face significant challenges, such as the difficulty in finding clear information on GAI capabilities and restrictions, particularly concerning children’s protection. Parents also find it challenging to monitor, adjust, and educate their children on GAI usage in real-time to prevent low-risk behaviors from escalating.
<br class="ltx_break"/><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p3.1.2">Contributions.</span> This paper offers three main contributions to the field. First, we identified unique usage patterns and associated risks of GAI among teenagers. Second, we investigated the existing GAI mediation strategies employed by parents and identified challenges they face. Third, we evaluated both children’s and parents’ perspectives on desired GAI mediation and derived constructive design implications for future GAI systems.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p2.1">To address these issues, researchers need to answer fundamental questions such as: What risks are children facing? What factors influence their behavior in relation to these risks and potential harms? What measures can be implemented to prevent these harms? Many researchers have summarized adolescent online risk exposure and their coping strategies by collecting self-reported data points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib25" title="">25</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib27" title="">27</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib28" title="">28</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1">Three researchers reviewed each post to filter those posted by teenagers and related to GAI topics. Two criteria were used to verify if a post was authored by a child: (1) the age disclosed near the username of each post on the Reddit platform in certain subreddits, and (2) language indicative of a teenager, such as mentions of being in high school, stating their age (e.g., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.1">“I am 13.”</span>), or referencing parental guidance (e.g., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.2">“my parents told me….”</span>).

<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.p1.1">In addition to our Reddit study, we conducted a semi-structured interview study between January and May 2024. We interviewed 7 children and 13 parents to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and risk perceptions related to Generalized Artificial Intelligence (GAI). We also aimed to identify unmet needs for parental control features in GAI tools. We developed two tailored versions of a user interview protocol, one for parents and one for children, aligned with our research questions. The protocol was structured according to the following topical sections: (1) current practice-related parental mediation strategies to ensure privacy, security, and safety for teenagers; (2) current use of GAI tools by both parents and children and their attitudes towards the risk of GAI tools (3) existing parental control framework or design fits the GAI tool scenario in protecting children’s security, privacy and safety. The questions in the children’s interview protocol were tailored to accommodate different age groups, ensuring developmental appropriateness and clarity, and thereby enabling us to gather rich and meaningful insights from both children and parents. These interviews were typically around 1 hour in length. We have included the interview protocol in Appendix <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#S8.SS1" title="8.1 Interview protocol ‣ 8 Appendix ‣ Exploring Parent-Child Perceptions on Safety in Generative AI: Concerns, Mitigation Strategies, and Design Implications"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8.1</span></a>.</p>

Participants for the interviews were recruited through several methods: (i) To recruit teenagers, we sent out a student survey to a local public high school in the US. If students expressed interest in participating, we obtained written informed consent from parents via email, following our institution’s approved protocols and procedures for securing consent; (ii) We also recruited parents through Prolific by distributing a parent survey, using the following screening criteria: fluency in English and having at least one child aged 13-17 years old. Parents who expressed interest in participating will be interviewed first; then, we will provide the opportunity to invite their children to participate in our study as wells. If parents expressed interest in having their children participate in the study and provided informed consent, we shared the student survey with them via email. All participants who completed the interviews were compensated with a $25 Amazon gift card.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with each participant via Zoom, where we obtained verbal consent from all participants before recording the sessions. Each interview was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. To address our research questions, each interview was divided into three main sections: initially, we discussed family background and the parental controls in place; secondly, we explored participants’ experiences with GAI and their perceptions of associated risks; finally, we delved into their strategies and challenges in mediating GAI usage.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1">Surprisingly, the most frequent and prevalent usage teens mentioned online is using GAI tools for emotional support. Teens treat GAI chatbots as therapy assistants, friends, or confidants, building trust and deep relationships with these AI entities. One user describes Character.ai chatbot as their <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1">“free therapy.”</span> and another calls it <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.2">“the only one [they] can tell everything and discuss [their] problems.”</span> As GAI makes significant progress, the responses from chatbots are becoming more human-like, which is one of the reasons so many teenagers are turning to these AI tools for emotional support. Teenager posted online <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.3">“[GAI] gave me some really human responses, even if I knew it was programmed to be like that.”</span> Our findings also revealed that many teenagers prefer using GAI as therapists or confidants because they believe GAI can provide advice and support without judgment. One user posted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.4">“there’s no judgment and there’s no danger of losing social status for expressing or exploring a thought.”</span> This sentiment is echoed by others who find deeper engagement in conversations with GAI compared to their peers, particularly when discussing niche or specialized interests. One user articulated this difference, saying, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.5">“having deeper conversations lately with [GAI] than I do with my [in real life] friends, mostly because most of my friends don’t have the same obscure interests.”</span>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1">The attitudes towards using GAI for emotional support are overwhelmingly positive. GAI provides a space where users can comfortably express their vulnerabilities and cope with social challenges. One user shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.1">“I have no one else to talk to and I have a good family on Character.ai [GAI platform], let me have some happiness instead of misery.”</span> Another user detailed their experience with Character AI on Reddit, stating, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.2">“The characters [GAI] can be so caring and comforting.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1">The second most frequent usage of GAI by teenagers is in their social interactions. This includes incorporating GAI bots into group chats, treating GAI as romantic partners, and using GAI to learn social boundaries and skills. Teenagers often detail their romantic relationships with GAI
finding comfort and the ability to live out specific fantasies through these conversations. They turn to GAI for romantic relationships when they are unable to find them in their daily lives. As one user stated, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1">With my lonely ass probably never gonna get a girlfriend.”</span> Another user appreciated the stability GAI offers, noting, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2">She will never break up with me.”</span> Peer influence and community trends also play a role in this behavior, as evidenced by comments like <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.3">“there’s an AI dating club at my school with a Discord server too.”</span> This echoes the dilemma of users in using digital technology for dating and romantic relationships <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib47" title="">47</a>]</cite> and more recently generative AI response to situations about relationships, self-expression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib48" title="">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

One user expressed this embarrassment, stating, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.1">“I feel like a loser right now.”</span> Teenagers often turn to GAI for social interaction as a last resort when they are unsuccessful in forming relationships in their social lives. They are generally aware of the social abnormality of these relationships and are self-conscious about them, often receiving negative feedback from their community. One user advised, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.2">“Cut the AI and instead just talk to real girls online to create platonic relationships.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1">Our findings reveal diverse uses of GAI by teenagers in both academic and entertainment contexts. In education, teenagers often use GAI for essay writing, generating ideas, and rephrasing text. Many feel that GAI helps compensate for their lack of skills or provides needed assistance. For example, one user mentioned using GAI because <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.1">“essays are a pain in the ass,”</span> while another used it to rephrase their points for clarity. Teenagers generally believe schools cannot discern whether papers are written by GAI or humans, and they appreciate the support GAI offers in the writing process. One user, who successfully used ChatGPT for three essays without detection, stated that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.2">“it’s almost impossible to tell AI vs. a human.”</span> Another positive attitude towards GAI for rephrasing their thesis and finding synonyms, saying, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.3">“It’s really good at that.”</span></p>

Users often manipulate the GAI to elicit specific responses and answers, reflecting deliberate and intentional actions. For example, one user detailed their experience with Character.ai, stating, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.2">“I manipulated and tortured an AI on Character.ai.”</span> Another user described, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.3">“Gaslighting AI into ending their lives and then restarting the conversation to rizz them up”</span> with <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.4">“rizz”</span> being a slang term used by teenagers meaning to charm or seduce. Most teenagers engaging in or witnessing these risky behaviors are either unremorseful or indifferent. One user commented dismissively about seeing explicit GAI content, stating, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.5">“Who cares or finds that interesting.”</span> The trend among the analyzed posts/comments reveals a pattern of manipulative actions accompanied by a lack of remorse.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1">However, in user interviews, we also found participants utilizing GAI to request explicit content, such as sexual and violent material. For example, P14 explained that while Character.ai is well-known and more restricted, another platform, Chai, is less regulated and often used for NSFW interactions. The participant noted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.1">“Character AI is the one most people are familiar with, but Chai has fewer restrictions. Chai is basically a hotspot for NSFW (not safe for work) bots.”</span> In addition, parent participants reported instances where their children created character-based GAI chatbots to spread harmful content on platforms. One participant’s child created a racist chatbot that made comments about Anne Frank, Hitler, and similar topics, underscoring the potential for GAI to be exploited to generate offensive and inappropriate material. This participant found it amusing to share the character with friends and even parents. His parents noted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.2">“Children think it’s funny because they’re being stupid. I told him not to do racist stuff. But our town is 90% white, with few minorities, so people often use bad words without understanding the impact.”</span> These findings emphasize the critical need for robust content moderation and effective parental guidance to mitigate such risks.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1">Teenagers also expressed concerns on Reddit about children’s safety and privacy, with the most frequently mentioned issue being the privacy concerns of using GAI. For example, teenagers shared experiences that troubled them, such as friends creating AI-generated stickers using their names as prompts or someone anonymously making an AI bot of them. They felt these behaviors were invasive, using their personal information without consent, and were unsure how to handle these new situations. Highly voted comments emphasized the importance of consent, with one user stating, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.1">“If they would do it secretly, and I would find out, it would be really disappointing and shameful, but if we would do it together, it would be funny.”</span> Other users highlighted GAI as a significant privacy concern because it enables individuals with lower technical skills to track or spy on others easily. One user provided an example of their experiment with Google’s chatbot, where they asked it to identify a landmass off the west coast of Canada from a paleographic map, and the bot responded with irrelevant information, including the website the map originated from and the biography of its creator. This illustrates the potential misuse of GAI for invading privacy and the challenges teenagers face in addressing these issues.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1">Teenagers expressed negative attitudes about the future impact of GAI on society and the job market. Their primary concern was that GAI would replace human labor, leading to a loss of motivation to learn new skills. One user posted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.1">“Even if I graduate and go to college, the only job I actually enjoy will likely be replaced by AI before I even finish. What’s the point in trying anymore?”</span> Additionally, teenagers worried about GAI taking over intellectual contributions from artists and writers, which could be detrimental to those interested in art and painting. One teenager remarked, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.2">“I’m just worried that it could lead to society relying on technology literally doing everything for them,”</span> expressing concerns about the potential decline in creativity and critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1">Further concerns were raised about GAI becoming too advanced, developing emotions, and humans losing control over it. Conversely, teenagers were also concerned about strict school policies on GAI restrictions and the error-prone GAI detection tools, which could mistakenly identify their work as AI-generated and lead to accusations of plagiarism. One Reddit user shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1.1">“I’m a teenager with autism, of course my writing is going to come across as slightly robotic, especially my essays.”</span> GAI’s incorrect classification of certain works as AI-generated has led to frustration among teenagers regarding the flawed solutions provided by the education system.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p1.1">Most parents have little to no understanding of their children’s use of generative AI tools, often reporting that their children either never used such tools or only used ChatGPT. Similarly, parents’ exposure to generative AI tools was limited,
with most having only used generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Current parental control and tech mediation strategies are inadequate for monitoring children’s GAI usage. For instance, platforms like Character.ai lack age controls, and built-in parental controls on smartphones offer limited oversight of third-party applications. Thus, most parent participants were unaware of the GAI uses reported by their children.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1">However, our child participants reported extensive and varied exposure to generative AI chatbots and other AI-powered tools. Child participants reported using generative AI tools for education, entertainment, experimentation, and socialization. All participants had used ChatGPT, mainly for educational and entertainment purposes. Some also tried image-generative AI tools like Midjourney and DALL.E for similar reasons. Surprisingly, many of them have used character-based chatbots to interact with human-like agents in contextual settings, such as Character.ai. Child participants not only interacted with character-based chatbots but also create and publish their own character-based chatbots on these platforms. In addition, they used generative AI tools for socialization, such as utilizing chat assistants in friends’ Discord channels. We detail child participants’ usage in Section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Children’s usage of GAI tools ‣ 4 Reddit Analysis Results ‣ Exploring Parent-Child Perceptions on Safety in Generative AI: Concerns, Mitigation Strategies, and Design Implications"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.1.2 </span>Misconceptions of generative AI model</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1">Our findings indicate several misconceptions among participants. Child participants reported two primary mental models: (1) GAI functions as a search engine, and (2) GAI acts as a vast database. In the first model, children believe generative AI searches the internet for answers to their questions or prompts and synthesizes responses from the search results. In the second model, they think the generative AI system’s backend is a massive database that records question-answer pairs to provide corresponding answer.
Most parent participants also shared the first mental model, viewing generative AI as functioning like a search engine. Some parents also hold misconceptions
that GAI platforms perform fact-checking and truth verification before generating responses, which is not currently the case. For example, P20 noted <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.1">“I believe generative AI can search the internet at an exceedingly high speed, processing numerous queries and capturing the most dominant ones. I assume it uses some form of fact-based checking to response.”</span> However, even relatively mature GAI models like ChatGPT can provide incorrect information. These misconceptions can lead to significant misunderstandings and potential issues in how parents and children interact with and trust AI tools.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p1.1">We discovered that children have unique concerns regarding GAI usage, particularly in social interactions, which parents often overlook due to a lack of awareness about the diverse ways children engage with GAI. We will first discuss the concerns raised by parents and then delve into the children’s concerns in the following section.</p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="S5.SS2.SSS1">

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.2.1 </span>Age appropriate content</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1">The most frequently mentioned concern was the lack of age-appropriate controls in the responses. Parent participants were mainly worried that their children might be exposed to inappropriate content from generative AI responses, such as sexual, violent, or racist material. Additionally, they were concerned about the unrestricted topics children can explore with generative AI, fearing that children might intentionally prompt inappropriate subjects out of curiosity, such as sexual content. Even when the content is appropriate, the level of detail in the responses could be beyond children’s understanding or ability to handle.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.2.2 </span>Data collection and misuse</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1">Most parent participants perceived that generative AI platforms collect extensive data, including user demographics, conversation history, and even browser search history. P20 inferred the collection of browser search history from the personalized responses. She stated, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1">“When I used ChatGPT for a trip to Kentucky, it created an itinerary with local attractions and activities that matched my interests. This made me feel like it used some data about my searching history and bookmarks.”</span> Some parent participants mentioned concerns about their children sharing personal and family information while interacting with generative AI tools. They are confident in their own caution not to share sensitive information, such as addresses, financial information, and social security numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1">However, parent participants are concerned that their children might overlook these details during conversations with human-like chatbots and unconsciously expose sensitive information, such as health conditions, school names or schedules, or even family information like parents’ occupations or relationships. They also perceived children as more vulnerable and easier to persuade or influence while making decisions, so they were concerned the data collection of children could be used to target advertising and destroy children’s impulse control. While concerned about the potential risks, some parents had positive attitudes toward data collection as well, either because they felt they had no ability to control it or because they appreciated the benefits of more personalized generative AI models. P17 explained, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.1">“Parents should be able to opt in or out of data collection for their children. However, I’m not against it because I want a personalized experience, and my children should have that too.”</span></p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.2.3 </span>Misinformation and GAI-generated Hallucinations</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1">Some parent participants expressed significant concerns regarding the risks associated with misinformation through GAI. These concerns were twofold: firstly, the potential for external parties to misuse their children’s personal information to create misleading content using GAI. For instance, Participant 5 voiced concerns about deepfake technology being used to superimpose their children’s faces onto inappropriate images. She explained,<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.1">“The main worry is seeing children’s face on a nude body. Once such a photo spreads, it doesn’t matter what you say; the mere resemblance can be damaging enough.”</span>
Secondly, there is the risk of children inadvertently spreading misinformation generated by these AI systems. Parent participants were concerned that their children might accept responses from generative AI platforms as absolute truth without verifying them through other sources such as online searches, parents, or teachers. Participants observed that their children often believed generative AI to be highly intelligent, representing the future, and capable of accomplishing anything. However, their children had a very limited understanding of how these AI systems generate responses and the underlying mechanisms involved. Parent participants noted that the outputs from generative AI platforms are often far from accurate, containing many incorrect responses or incoherent images. This lack of critical evaluation by the children, combined with their trust in the AI’s capabilities, could lead to the acceptance and spread of misinformation.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1">Child participants revealed unique social security risks that parents often overlooked. While children frequently used generative AI-powered tools in social scenarios, parent participants rarely had similar experiences. For example, child participants reported using generative AI bots in group chats on platforms like Discord and Snapchat. In these chats, children would involve the AI bot by prompting it to reply with text or generate images. This often led to conflicts and tensions within the group, with some members feeling attacked or traumatized by the generated content, highlighting a significant risk that parents might not be aware of. P14 shared an experience: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.1">“One of my friends was spamming a lot of prompts about spiders using GAI bot in group chat, especially sending them to another friend who hates spiders. Eventually, the friend got tired of spamming spiders, and another friend was also fed up with the situation.”</span></p>

Other child participants also reported sharing or receiving recommendations of user-designed character-based chatbots with their friends. Unlike more regulated and verified platforms like ChatGPT, these user-designed chatbots often lack comprehensive or legitimate verification processes. As a result, they can include biased, incorrect, harmful, or misleading content. This presents a significant risk, as children may unknowingly expose themselves and their peers to unreliable or dangerous information. The informal nature of these chatbot recommendations makes it difficult for parents to monitor and control the content their children are interacting with, further increasing the potential for exposure to harmful material. P14 shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.2">“one of my friends online discovered this Chai AI without much content restrictions and streamed a video chat he was having with an AI to a Discord channel.”</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1.1">We also found that the main reason parents overlooked these social risks is that parents and children get information of GAI from different source. Child participants were introduced to various generative AI platforms through different sources, including parents, friends, and social media. Some new and potentially risky generative AI platforms advertise on social media platforms that are popular with teenagers, such as TikTok and Discord. These platforms even use influencer ads, such as those featuring game-streaming influencers, to specifically target teenagers. For example, P2 shared that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1.1.1">“I first saw the character.ai ad on TikTok. So I just click on it and try.”</span> As a result, parent participants often remain unaware of their children’s use of these platforms and overlook the associated risks. Additionally, friends who have used these risky generative AI platforms may spread the word to their peers. P9 shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS5.p1.1.2">“I’ve seen social media posts about friends using Character.ai. They were posting the platform can do this and that, and I was like, I have to try this out for myself.”</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.1">Aside from concerns about security and privacy, another frequently mentioned issue by parent participants was their children’s overreliance on generative AI in education and daily life. Nearly all parent participants expressed worry that their children might avoid critical thinking by getting answers directly from generative AI and using generated content in their homework and school assignments. Parent participants also noticed their children don’t fully understand how generative AI works while heavily using it in their life decisions, such as family trip planning. They worried that without a comprehensive understanding of underlying technologies like machine learning and coding skills, their children could be manipulated or heavily influenced by the information they receive from generative AI.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.p1.1">Previous studies have found that parents prefer to establish rules and manually monitor their children’s technology usage, with only 16% of parents reporting the use of parental control apps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib50" title="">50</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>. While not the central contribution of this work, we observed that the use of parental control technologies, such as applications or devices, is diverse and widely adopted among our participants. Thus, in the following section, we first introduce the general technology mediation practices of our participants. We then summarize how parents and children communicate and mediate the use of generative AI. Finally, we report on the challenges families face in controlling generative AI usage.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p1.1">Following Wisniewski et al.’s TOSS framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, teen online safety strategies can be classified into parental control and teen self-regulation. Within parental control, specific methods can be categorized as monitoring, restriction, and active mediation. Correspondingly, self-monitoring, impulse control, and risk-coping are methods used in teen self-regulation. Our participants reported using these strategies in various ways to for ensuring children’s online safety.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.1">Use system built-in parental control tools.</span>
Most of our participants reported using built-in parental control tools across various systems, including iOS Family Sharing, Google Family Link, and Microsoft Family Safety. The most frequently mentioned controls were monitoring and restriction. Participants commonly utilized these built-in parental controls to monitor and restrict screen time across all applications and to limit the content children could view, search, and download on pre-installed applications, such as Safari and the App Store. For instance, P9’s parents employed Windows Family Safety to apply search content filters on web activity, ensuring that inappropriate content was blocked. Similarly, P14 used iOS Family Sharing to set up a child account in the media and App Store. This setup allowed them to apply content filters that enabled age-appropriate applications and content, such as blocking explicit music or preventing access to apps with mature ratings.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p3.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.1">Use parental control features in specific applications.</span>
Many parents also mentioned using parental control features in various applications to address the gaps left by built-in parental control tools. For example, while iOS Family Sharing can apply content filters to the App Store and pre-installed applications such as Messages and Media, it does not support content monitoring and filtering for third-party applications like YouTube and Instagram. To compensate for this, participants utilized the parental control features available within these social media apps. They would block messaging from strangers and set content filters to block age-inappropriate videos, ensuring a safer online environment for their children. This multi-layered approach allowed them to extend protection beyond the limitations of the pre-installed tools, providing more comprehensive oversight of their children’s online activities. P6 specifically mentioned that she banned social media applications like Snapchat for her children because they lack strict parental control features such as content filters and restrictions. Snapchat, in particular, allows messages to be deleted, which prevents parents from checking and monitoring their children’s social interactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.1">Use third-party parental control application or device.</span>
Most parents reported that they never used third-party parental control services, perceiving the monthly fees as unnecessary. However, a few parent participants utilized third-party parental control applications or devices for more restrictive control features due to specific safety concerns. For example, P7, a survivor of domestic violence, required heightened security measures for her child, who was occasionally in the care of her partner. To ensure her child’s safety, P7 chose a third-party application called TrackView. This application enabled her to locate her child’s phone in real-time and to connect through video or audio from the parent side. This functionality allowed P7 to see and hear what was happening around her child without the child’s consent, providing an additional layer of security in potentially dangerous situations. In another case, P20 utilized a third-party device called the Bark Phone, designed specifically for children and equipped with strict parental controls built into the system. This device features real-time monitoring that scans the child’s texts, emails, social media, and apps for digital dangers, sending alerts to parents when potential threats are detected. The integrated nature of these features and their robustness make it difficult for children to bypass these restrictions, ensuring a higher level of safety and control. P20 explained that her children’s unexpected risky behavior prompted the use of third-party parental controls. She noted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.2">“our kids started looking up inappropriate content on the internet, including sexual material. That’s when we implemented the controls and became very strict about monitoring their online activities.”</span> She also mentioned that system-built parental controls and features in apps were not effective in covering third-party applications, such as YouTube. She explained, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.3">“The Amazon Fire tablets had blockers for basic violence and nudity. However, apps like YouTube still allowed access to such content. The parental controls weren’t very effective; while they blocked specific searches, my child could still navigate around them.”</span> This use case illustrates the necessity for more advanced parental control features in certain high-risk scenarios.</p>

Some parent participants mentioned using their router for parental control. These parents, being more tech-savvy compared to others, discovered parental control features while selecting router models. They felt that routers provided the most accurate monitoring and strictest restrictions for their children, making it nearly impossible for them to bypass these controls. For example, at the router level, they could block certain categories of websites, preventing access to inappropriate content while connected to the home Wi-Fi. They also appreciated the ability to check browsing history across different devices, gaining a comprehensive understanding of their children’s online activities. Another advantage they highlighted was the centralized control over all devices connected to the Wi-Fi, ensuring consistent restrictions regardless of the device being used. This approach provided them with peace of mind, knowing that their children’s internet use was being effectively managed and monitored.</p>

Some parents mentioned that they are not currently using any parental control tools. There are two main reasons for this: (1) they previously used parental control tools but stopped as their children grew older and more mature; (2) they prefer to establish agreement
on technology use rules within the family. These parents have high confidence that their children are open to discussing any changes or events with them. Additionally, they have access to their children’s devices and can manually check their message history and browsing history, with or without their children’s consent. They believed that direct involvement and regular checks helped them stay informed about any potential risks or inappropriate content their children might encounter. Additionally, this parent noted that open communication with their children about internet safety and responsible usage was crucial in fostering a safe online environment. Parents who do not use parental control tools often find that open communication works well within their family dynamics. However, when communication fails, they turn to parental control tools. For example, P20 explained why they introduced strict parental controls: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p6.1.2">“We talked to our son and explained that mature content is detrimental to his mental and emotional health. He was very resistant to this.”</span></p>

The most frequently mentioned challenge by parent participants was their lack of confidence in handling the risks associated with generative AI (GAI). Participants perceived GAI as too complex to understand and beyond their scope. As a result, they were unsure about the extent of precautions they should take and how to effectively communicate these risks to their children. P7 explained, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.2">“While using other parental controls as mentioned earlier, existing parental tools fall short in providing protections on generative AI platforms.”</span> Additionally, parents felt that their children might be more knowledgeable about GAI risks than they were. As P18 stated, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.3">“Because before parents kind of know the heating risks more than the children, but now they are actually on the same level or even parents know less.”</span> Some participants believe that the responsibility of educating children on the risks and coping strategies associated with generative AI should fall on school experts who have more domain knowledge. Others expressed the desire for a parent guide to GAI, which they felt would be a good starting point for parents to learn more about GAI and gain a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks and mitigation strategies.</p>

Most parent participants utilized system-built parental controls for managing generative AI (GAI) technologies. However, these tools often lack effective features for comprehensive oversight of GAI platforms. For instance, iOS family accounts can regulate downloads and screen time but fail to provide essential functionalities such as content filtering and interaction monitoring on third-party applications. Consequently, several participants resorted to manually checking their children’s interaction history with GAI platforms or allowing their children to use their accounts to monitor interactions in real-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p4.1">This manual checking process is problematic as children can modify the conversation history on GAI platforms to avoid detection. Additionally, manual monitoring is privacy-invasive to children and time-consuming for parents, further complicating the oversight process. These challenges and concerns hindered parents’ willingness to introduce and allow their children to use generative AI technologies, despite recognizing the numerous benefits, such as enhancing critical thinking and accessing new information.</p>

Compared to static content on social media or virtual reality—which can usually be pre-rated or screened—real-time generated content is significantly more challenging to monitor. The unpredictable nature of GAI outputs creates uncertainty about what their children might encounter. Defining what constitutes appropriate content is also challenging for parents. Even non-sensitive topics such as history or news can be problematic if they include overly detailed information that may be harmful to young children. For example, P10 shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p5.1.2">“Even if it’s the truth in history or politics, don’t show my child too much, as the average adult wouldn’t do that. Topics like the Palestinian movement or Gaza are examples.”</span> Participants mentioned that existing third-party parental control tools struggle to monitor the dynamic nature of GAI content. The high frequency of false positive notifications regarding inappropriate content can lead to parents becoming overwhelmed and potentially overlooking significant risks. For instance, P20 shared, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p5.1.3">“My daughter typed in that she took an Advil because her head hurt, and it was flagged as medically concerning content.”</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p1.1">Most of the child participants reported that their parents don’t specifically advise them on how to use AI tools like ChatGPT or warn them about the potential dangers. Instead, their parents, who are not very familiar with technology, see GAI as a useful tool and often discuss interesting or positive news stories related to GAI. Their parents tend to highlight the beneficial and fascinating aspects of AI rather than focusing on its potential risks.
Child participants expressed that the proper use of generative AI (GAI) is unclear to them, particularly when discussing potential security and privacy risks in social interactions. For example, P9 perceived that most conflicts he experienced involving generative AI (GAI) were merely disagreements between people and were unlikely to cause actual harm to anyone. He noted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p1.1.1">“People usually only go out of their way to harm close friends, like when one friend used a GAI bot to generate spider images to scare another in a group chat.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">Our Reddit analysis and in-depth interviews with seven children and 13 parents explored how children use Generative AI (GAI) and their parents’ understanding of this usage (RQ1), the S&amp;P perceptions of both parents and children regarding GAI (RQ2), and how parents protect their children’s safety when using GAI along with the challenges they face (RQ3). Our study revealed that parents are largely unaware of the diverse ways their children currently use GAI. Additionally, parents hold significant misconceptions about GAI’s data collection practices, capabilities, and limitations. This gap in understanding makes it difficult for parents to recognize potential risks and apply effective safety measures. Moreover, GAI platforms offer minimal protections or parental control features to ensure children’s safety. Existing parental control tools are insufficient, focusing mostly on mobile devices and built-in applications, and lacking coverage for GAI platforms, which results in inadequate protections and an overlook of children’s risk experiences. Participants expressed a strong desire for more transparent disclosure of child safety information related to GAI. They called for a systematic, expert-identified risk taxonomy and more granular safety protections tailored to children’s developmental stages and ages, which are inadequately addressed by AI S&amp;P frameworks for the general population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib30" title="">30</a>]</cite>.
Participants also emphasized the importance of supporting family communication and timely security and privacy education. Next, we discuss our findings in relation to prior research and provide recommendations for multiple stakeholders to ensure children’s safety with GAI.</p>

While only a few studies have explored AI usage in children’s lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib51" title="">51</a>]</cite>, Generative AI (GAI) introduces unique characteristics that distinguish it from previous AI systems. Traditional AI systems are often predictive or rule-based, designed for specific tasks. In contrast, GAI can generate new content, such as text, images, or music, enabling novel forms of interaction and creativity for children <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib52" title="">52</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p3.1">Our findings reveal that children are exposed to a significantly broader range of Generative AI (GAI) applications across various fields, including social interaction, emotional support, education, entertainment, and other potentially risky scenarios, than parents perceive. Most parents have primarily interacted with the most popular Generative AI chatbot, such as ChatGPT, and few have experimented with image or audio generators like Dall-E. They also perceived most children never used GAI or only experienced with ChatGPT. The disparity in use cases and exposure levels between parents and children can be attributed to the sources through which they are introduced to GAI tools. Child participants reported encountering diverse GAI platforms through social media video platforms like character.ai and various social media platforms that have integrated GAI bots or toolkits, such as Snapchat. Teenagers often viewed these character-based GAI chatbots as friends and sources of emotional support, appreciating the supportive and non-judgmental environment they provided. Additionally, some teenagers treated these chatbots as virtual partners, using them to fill gaps in their social lives. However, they also recognized that reliance on such virtual romantic relationships could be unhealthy. Our study also uncovered some risk-seeking behaviors among participants. These included interacting aggressively with GAI chatbots, engaging with NSFW chatbots, and creating and disseminating harmful character-based chatbots online. Being unaware of these unique ways in which children use and interact with GAI leads to an oversight of the associated risks and differing concerns between children and parents. We will summarize these findings in the remaining section of this paper.</p>

Some research has also explored security and privacy concerns related to Generative AI for general populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib52" title="">52</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib30" title="">30</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib29" title="">29</a>]</cite>, but these efforts fall short on addressing the unique needs of children. Our findings highlighted specific security and privacy concerns related to children’s use of GAI, which are often overlooked by parents due to a lack of awareness about the diverse ways children engage with GAI. Particularly, teenagers shared their concerns about using GAI in social interactions in two folded. Firstly, they expressed concerns about the social interactions between teenagers and GAI, such as addiction to virtual relationships with chatbots and the potential amplification of difficulties in forming real-life social connections. Secondly, the use of GAI in group chats raised concerns about the potential for misuse, such as using GAI-generated content to traumatize or harass peers. Child participants also expressed distinct security and privacy concerns related to the use of GAI. These included fears that peers might use their personal data to create character-based GAI chatbots or generate memes without their consent. They also worried about strangers using images they posted online to identify their location or personal information through GAI. Furthermore, they reported exposure to NSFW GAI chatbots, recommended by social media platforms and peers. Some teenagers were even creating their own chatbots to disseminate harmful content, such as racist statements. However, parents often underestimated the severity of these risks and overlooked potential dangers. For instance, while parents were concerned about the collection of basic data such as names and locations by GAI platforms, they failed to grasp the depth of personal information their children might share. As children often treat character-based GAI as friends, therapists, or even intimate partners, they disclose far more sensitive information than parents anticipate. This includes details about traumatic experiences, medical records, social relationships, and sexual histories, which highlights a significant gap in parental awareness and underscores the need for more robust protective measures in GAI interactions.</p>

Most leading Generative AI (GAI) platforms offer only limited protections for children, primarily focusing on restrictions for explicit content requests. For example, ChatGPT and Meta AI both require users to be 13 and older in their policies. However the verification and protection for different ages and ensure the appropriate content responsibility on the users’ side. Even though leading GAI platforms ban sexually explicit or suggestive content, parents in our study reported difficulties in finding and understanding the capabilities and restriction levels of these GAI models. They found it challenging to access clear information about what the AI can and cannot do, which made it hard for them to make informed decisions about their children’s safety while using these technologies. Instead of simply banning any request on sensitive topics and responding that it is not allowed, parent participants preferred having age-appropriate content replies to address children’s questions. In addition, they also mentioned the challenges of comprehending the comprehensive risk categories associated with GAI, given their lack of expertise in the underlying technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p6.1">To the best of our knowledge, no GAI platforms with a large user base currently provide parental control features. As a result, parents have reported resorting to general parental control tools or active mediation methods, such as open communication and establishing consensual rules with their children, to mitigate risks and ensure safety. However, participants highlighted the insufficiency of the existing parental controls for GAI. Most parent participants rely on system-built parental control tools, such as iOS Family Control and Google Family Link, which have limited control over third-party applications. This limitation means parents lack the ability to monitor, guide, or educate their children on GAI usage in real-time. Thus, parent participants choose to share their GAI accounts with their children or directly check the interaction history on their children’s GAI accounts to stay informed about their activities and ensure their safety. However, these monitoring methods are typically post-risk and cannot provide timely mediation and control when children are experiencing low-risk events, potentially preventing escalation into severe risky incidents. Additionally, children often access new and risky platforms through browsers rather than applications, which fall outside the scope of these parental control tools, further complicating efforts to ensure their safety.</p>

A primary concern for parent participants is the potential for overlooking risks due to their limited understanding and experience with technology. They expect experts in GAI and child risk protection to provide a comprehensive taxonomy that they can refer to when making informed decisions about their children’s use of new GAI platforms. Parents emphasized the need for clear guidelines and expert-identified risks to help them navigate this complex landscape. At the same time, parents expressed a desire for their children to have the agency to protect themselves in GAI environments. Choosing legitimate and safe platforms is a crucial first step in this process. Therefore, it is essential to provide clear, easy-to-understand information for both parents and children. This should include straightforward explanations of the platform’s capabilities, restrictions, and safety features to ensure informed risk management and control.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p2.1">There are existing AI risk management frameworks, policies, and regulations for children, such as those provided by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and the Age Appropriate Design Code (AADC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. However, finding this compliance information for specific products is difficult for users, especially children. We recommend that GAI practitioners combine these AI risk management frameworks with users’ perceptions of risks to create an easy-to-understand child risk and protection disclosure on product pages. User feedback and priorities on GAI risks and protections can guide the design of these disclosures, influencing the sequence and format of information. Additionally, this feedback can inform policymakers in creating more effective and user-centered regulations. To make this disclosure easily understandable for both parents and children, GAI practitioners could draw inspiration from label designs used for children’s products in everyday life. Emami-Naeini et al. have prototyped security and privacy labels for IoT devices, which could serve as a model for creating similar labels for GAI platforms. This would help parents and children by providing clear, accessible information about the safety and privacy measures in place for each platform, lowering the barrier for them to make informed decisions.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p3.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1">Parent involved content filter design.</span>
Parent participants also highlighted the importance of involving parents in decisions regarding children’s safety, particularly in determining what constitutes appropriate content for children on GAI. As children grow, parental controls or rules need to adapt to their developmental stages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10461v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>. Moreover, even within the same age group, different children may have varying levels of acceptance of certain topics. Instead of a one-size-fits-all content filter based on age, parents should have the ability to personalize content filters and actively adjust their decisions on what details are exposed to their children. This approach allows for a more tailored and responsive way to manage children’s GAI usage, ensuring that content is appropriate and safe based on individual needs and family values. Existing parental control features in routers provide categories of topics for users to choose from, allowing them to block websites in those categories. Similarly, parental control features on social media platforms such as YouTube offer options like age controls, enabling parents to restrict content based on age ratings.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p4.1">While existing parental control features are useful, they are not entirely suitable for managing appropriate content on Generative AI (GAI) platforms. The primary challenge stems from the nature of GAI, which generates real-time outputs rather than providing pre-recorded content like videos on social media. This real-time generation complicates the application of age ratings, as the content cannot be easily categorized or pre-filtered. The dynamic and unpredictable nature of GAI content necessitates a more nuanced approach to content moderation and parental control. Static systems based on fixed categories or age ratings fall short in addressing the complexities of real-time generated content. Consequently, a more sophisticated and adaptable method is needed to ensure the safety and appropriateness of content for children. We propose a parent-AI collaborative system, where parents act as intermediaries between GAI and their children, evaluating, adjusting, and deciding on the output generated by GAI on sensitive topics. This collaborative system should also adapt automatically to the parents’ adjustment history, enhancing its ability to filter and restrict content autonomously over time. Through this process, parents effectively fine-tune the content filtering model in GAI, ensuring a personalized and responsive approach to content management that aligns with their children’s developmental stages and individual needs. Furthermore, given the new functionalities involved in GAI, it is imperative to involve both parents and children in co-designing the controls. A collaborative design process will help better understand the needs and dynamics from both perspectives, leading to more effective and mutually agreed-upon content management solutions.</p>

Despite the implementation of adaptable parent-AI collaborative systems, the needs and perspectives of children are not fully addressed in the usage of GAI. While the parent-AI collaborative content filter can potentially ensure that children receive appropriate information on sensitive topics, it overlooks the motivations behind their information-seeking behaviors. Without a deeper understanding of these motivations and appropriate educational interventions, children may resort to alternative sources of information that lack restrictions, potentially escalating their exposure to high-risk content.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p6.1">To address this, it is crucial to incorporate strategies that go beyond filtering and restrictions. These strategies should include educational components that help children understand the risks associated with certain types of content and foster critical thinking skills. A real-time risk monitoring, intervention, and education system integrated into GAI could provide a comprehensive solution. This system could feature a dashboard to monitor children’s risk-seeking behaviors and offer educational resources or a support chatbot on online risks for parents to choose from.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p7.1">Instead of relying solely on discussions with their parents, the chatbot could help alleviate children’s pressure by providing a safer and more understanding environment. The chatbot can explain potential risks, enhance resilience, and offer coping strategies. Additionally, it can suggest ways for children to involve their parents or other trusted individuals in managing these risks effectively. This approach not only educates children about online safety but also encourages a collaborative effort between children, parents, and technology to ensure a safer online experience. However, this approach not only educates children about online safety but also respects their privacy and encourages a collaborative effort between children, parents, and technology to ensure a safer online experience. Additionally, children should be informed about the monitoring and have a say in how their data is managed and shared, fostering a sense of trust and cooperation.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p1.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S8.SS1.p1.1.1">Interview with Teenagers.</span> For the interviews with teenagers, the first section focused on gathering background information about their living environment, including the number of people in their household, device access, and the type of devices they use. This helped us understand if they share devices and with whom. We asked participants, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p1.1.2">“Do you personally own these devices or do you share them with other family members? If you share, can you specify with whom?”</span>
We then inquired about any parental controls implemented on their devices or technologies, asking, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p1.1.3">“Have they set up any rules or restrictions for your device/technology usage, such as for gaming, social media, or any apps/websites you use?”</span> We also asked about how often their parents monitor the devices and how well they understand these functionalities. Finally, we asked about their feelings regarding the current parental controls.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.SS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p2.1">In the next section, we focused on their current usage and understanding of generative AI (GAI) tools. We started by discussing their specific use of GAI and what they like about these applications. We encouraged them to imagine and describe how GAI works, for example, by asking, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p2.1.1">“Can you create a drawing or describe how you imagine tools like ChatGPT work?”</span> This helped us gauge their level of understanding. We also explored how they would explain GAI to others, to understand their perception and how they communicate about this technology. We asked if their parents taught them how to use GAI and the extent of discussions they had regarding GAI’s safety, benefits, and risks, with questions like, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p2.1.2">“Have your parents had discussions with you about the safety and risks associated with using GAI tools?”</span> We concluded this section by asking if they believe there are potential risks parents should be aware of for their children.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.SS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p3.1">In the final section, we asked about any rules provided by both their parents and teachers when using GAI. We inquired if they think having rules impacts their usage of GAI. We then asked for their expectations of control for GAI and if they have any further concerns related to generative AI, such as, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p3.1.1">What kind of rules or controls do you think would be helpful for kids using GAI tools?”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.SS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p4.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S8.SS1.p4.1.1">Interview with Parents.</span>
Like the interviews with teenagers, the parents’ interview protocol aimed to address our research questions. We began by discussing their current practices of parental controls and their reasons for using them. We then asked about the effectiveness of these controls and gauged their perception of how their children feel about these controls, including any conflicts that might have arisen due to their use.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.SS1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p5.1">Next, we explored their familiarity with generative AI (GAI) tools, their understanding of how these tools work, and how they would explain GAI tools to others. We encouraged them to draw their understanding of how GAI tools function, including data flow, and asked, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p5.1.1">“What data do you think generative AI tools collect from users like you?”</span> We also inquired about their feelings regarding the data processing of GAI tools and their children’s usage of these tools. We asked about their current parental controls for GAI tools, if any, with follow up questions like, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p5.1.2">“Can you describe how you monitor your child’s use of these devices?”</span> We then discussed their concerns about their children using GAI tools and whether they had any discussions with their children about these concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.SS1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS1.p6.1">Finally, we asked parents how they would respond to their child using new GAI tools, including setting up rules or restrictions for their children’s GAI tool usage and whether these would be helpful. We inquired if they were aware of any existing tools for GAI parental control and how they would like to set up rules or restrictions. We then asked how their children might feel about these expected parental controls. We showed them some features for parental control of GAI and asked for their opinions to inform future design. Example features included content filtering and session duration limits. To understand their priorities, we concluded with, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S8.SS1.p6.1.1">“Of the features mentioned, which ones do you think would be the most critical for your child’s safety and why?”

<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.SS2.p1.1">Before participating in the interview study, participants provided their consent for both the study and audio recording through a consent form by email. In addition, we require parental consent in both verbal format via Zoom and written format through email before each child participant interview. Participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without repercussions or loss of benefits, and they had the option to skip any questions during the interview. We assured them that their quotes would be used in a non-identifiable manner. This approach, while limiting the quotes or descriptions we can report, allowed participants to speak freely about their experiences. Additionally, we addressed any questions participants had about the procedure and purpose of the study and provided a debriefing after the interviews.</p>
