<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text">The development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for the promotion of deep neural network (DNN)-based applications. However, the large amount of parameters and computational complexity of DNN makes it difficult to deploy it on edge devices which are resource-constrained. An efficient method to address this challenge is model partition/splitting, in which DNN is divided into two parts which are deployed on device and server respectively for co-training or co-inference. In this paper, we consider a split federated learning (SFL) framework that combines the parallel model training mechanism of federated learning (FL) and the model splitting structure of split learning (SL). We consider a practical scenario of heterogeneous devices with individual split points of DNN. We formulate a joint problem of split point selection and bandwidth allocation to minimize the system latency. By using alternating optimization, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems and solve them optimally. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our work in latency reduction and accuracy improvement.</span></p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of deep learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, many artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been widely used in practice, such as face recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, augment reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In AI applications, machine learning (ML) models including convolutional neural network (CNN) or deep neural network (DNN) are trained by rich data generated by network edge (like sensors and internet-of-thing (IoT) devices), and the principle is to update the parameters of the model to minimize the error of the output results and finally establish a mapping function to make predictions on unknown data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, data is usually privately sensitive (such as medical and financial data), and as a result, enterprises or individuals may resist sharing their data to service providers to centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As devices always have a certain level of computing capability, distributed learning enabling local training at device is more attractive since raw data of device is used for local training but kept at device locally to reduce privacy leakage risks. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a promising distributed learning framework, in which a ML model is obtained with a central server aggregating local models trained by distributed devices. Specifically, each device first downloads a global model from server. Then each device trains a local model based on its local data and then transmits local model to server. Finally server aggregates all received local models to update global model. The above device-server iteration continues until convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL brings up new challenges over wireless/edge networks, due to the limited computing and communication power on devices. On the one hand, ML model especially DNN often requires huge amount of parameters and calculation of the model. For example, AlexNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> needs more than 200 MBytes of memory to store parameters, while that of VGG16 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is as high as 500 MBytes. The intensive computation of DNN on devices such as IoT sensors and smart phones is not so effective. On the other hand, as DNN parameters are usually high-dimensional and thus the DNN transmission from devices to server suffers from high energy consumption and delay.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Split learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is another distributed learning method to deal with the challenges raised by FL. According to the fact that DNN is composed of multiple layers, DNN can be partitioned into two parts vertically where the front-end part and the back-end part are executed on the device and server respectively. In training phase, device processes its raw data through the front-end part of DNN, and then sends the intermediate result to server to complete the forward propagation stage. Then, in backward propagation stage, server updates the parameters of the back-end part and sends back the intermediate gradients to device to finish the parameters update of the front-end part. In the whole process, the transmission between device and server is only the intermediate result of the split point, instead of the whole DNN parameters. By doing so, most of the computation is offloaded to server whose computing power is much stronger than that of device, so that the computing cost will be greatly saved. In addition, device does not need to transmit huge DNN model parameters but small intermediate result of a certain layer of DNN, the communication load will also be reduced.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">By integrating the collaborative training framework of FL and neural network splitting structure of SL, split federated learning (SFL) is showed to be more communication efficient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, these work only evaluate the performance of SFL experimentally, how to split DNN and improve communication efficiency for SFL is largely unknown.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive works focus on delay and energy minimization, i.e., communication efficiency for FL. The transmission of DNN parameters from devices to server requires a great deal of communication resources, and DNN model compression can reduce communication load <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose a topology-optimized scheme to improve the both communication and computation efficiency.

As devices are energy constrained, resource allocation for energy efficiency is studied for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on above related work, it is found that most effort on communication efficiency is devoted to either FL or SL, and how to improve communication efficiency for SFL has few attention. This problem is non-trivial due to two-folds: First, compared to DNN splitting used for inference, in SFL the sub-models need to be aggregated at server, and thus the selection of split points significantly affects the convergence performance. Second, due to the heterogeneity of multiple devices, including local data, fading channels, and communication-computing capacity, the resources of devices should be jointly optimized together with the split points.</p>

The server connects with devices via wireless channels. Due to the limited computing capacity, the devices need to offload part of the training tasks to the server. In SFL, the devices and server collaboratively train a common DNN model but they only train a portion of the DNN model, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ II-A Split Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model and Problem formulation ‣ Accelerating Split Federated Learning over Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>. Specifically, on each device the DNN is split to two parts, where the front-end part is deployed on the device and the other is deployed on the server. This implies that each device has an individual split point of the DNN, due to the fact that the devices have heterogeneous computing and transmission capacity. To tackle the issue of different split points of devices, for easy implementation, we assume that the server only aggregates the parts that are common to all back-end sub-models.

Note that FL only needs to transmit once in each round while SFL needs multiple transmissions. However, the computation time saved by SFL compared to FL is significant, because most of the computation is done by the server, whereas in FL all the computation is undertook by the resource-limited devices. Therefore, even if SFL requires multiple local updates in a round, SFL can be more efficient than FL.</p>

In following, we focus on latency in one iteration, thus the indices of iteration <math id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p1.4.m4.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> are omitted for brevity.</p>

Therefore, in next section we decompose P1 into two sub-problems, solving the optimization of split points and bandwidth ratios respectively. However, searching the split point is tightly coupled with the bandwidth allocation for the goal of latency minimization, because both of these variables affect the transmission latency. Therefore, we use alternating optimization to solve the two variables.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the latency performance of our proposed system with different DNN models by experiment. In our experiment, AlexNet is considered as structures with 20 layers. We first calculate the amount of MACs and transmitting data of each layer for AlexNet, as showed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Computation Amount of DNN Model ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Accelerating Split Federated Learning over Wireless Communication Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. We can observe that the Convolutional layers have the most amount of computation, which occupies more than 90% of the total amount. In contrast, the computation amount of Activation layers (relu) and Normalization layers (norm) is much lower. On the other hand, it is noted that the amount of data transmitted shows a downward trend with the increase of layer number.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to test the effect of the proposed scheme, we compare the latency performance of the proposed SFL scheme and FedAvg, where Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-E SFL v.s.

We follow the previous experimental settings and assume that there are 1,500 training objects locally for each device. It can be seen that the computing latency of the proposed SFL has a huge gain over the classical FedAvg. For VGG16, both of the computing and transmitting latency are much lower than that of FedAvg, which saves more than 75% latency. For AlexNet, although the communication latency of the proposed SFL scheme is a little higher than that of FedAvg in the case of better channels, the computing latency is greatly reduced, which makes the overall latency significantly lower than that of FedAvg.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studied the problem of joint split point selection and bandwidth allocation to minimize the total latency in SFL.
We proposed an alternating optimization to solve the problem efficiently.
We obtained the following insights: First, split points of DNN is crucial in SFL, which affects the time efficiency and model accuracy. Second, compared to FL, the proposed SFL can significantly save the latency. Third, the SFL outperforms FL on test accuracy in the same time.</p>

Therefore, the transmission latency reduces if device is allocated with more bandwidth. In this way, the devices which have higher latency should be allocated with more bandwidth, from which have lower latency. To the end, the optimal solution of P2 can be achieved if and only if all bandwidth is allocated and all devices have the same finishing time. As a result, the optimal bandwidth allocation ration should satisfy the following equation:</p>
