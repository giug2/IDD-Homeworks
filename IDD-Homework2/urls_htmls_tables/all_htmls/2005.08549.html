<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Understanding the association between injury severity and patients’ potential for recovery is crucial to providing better care for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Estimation of this relationship requires clinical information on injury severity, patient demographics, and healthcare utilization, which are often obtained from separate data sources. Because of privacy and confidentiality regulations, these data sources do not include unique identifiers to link records across data sources. Record linkage is a process to identify records that represent the same entity across data sources that contain similar individuals in the absence of unique identifiers. These processes commonly rely on agreement between variables that appear in both data sources to link records. However, when the number of records in each file is large, this task is computationally intensive and may result in false links. Blocking is a data partitioning technique that reduces the number of possible links that should be considered. Healthcare providers can be used as blocks in applications of record linkage with healthcare datasets. However, providers may not be uniquely identified across files. We propose a Bayesian record linkage procedure that simultaneously performs block-level and record-level linkage. This iterative approach incorporates the record-level linkage within block pairs to improve the accuracy of the block-level linkage. Subsequently, the algorithm improves record-level linkage using the accurate partitioning of the linkage space through blocking. We demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides improved performance compared to existing Bayesian record linkage methods that do not incorporate blocking. The proposed procedure is then used to merge registry data from the National Trauma Data Bank with Medicare claims data to estimate the relationship between injury severity and TBI patients’ recovery.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States, especially among adults over the age of 65 (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Faul et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gardner et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>). The high incidence rate coupled with evidence of demanding medical and post-acute care poses a growing and potentially costly public health concern (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thompson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dams-O’Connor et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>). Understanding a patient’s potential for functional improvement and regaining independence during post-acute care is critical to discharge planning and identifying long term health needs. Heterogeneity in trauma characteristics and pre-injury factors can greatly impact the functional recovery and long term health outcomes of patients (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yue et al. (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Peters and Gardner (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>). Previous studies have either examined detailed injury and acute clinical information but focused on short term health outcomes such as mortality (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Clark et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Aitken et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dinh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>), or investigated functional outcome assessments without accounting for injury or treatment information (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Buchanan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>). A major factor contributing to the lack of research that examines how pre-existing medical conditions and functional status impact long term post-acute health outcomes is the lack of a complete dataset that includes detailed injury and clinical data, functional status assessments, patient histories, and long term health outcomes. This data can be obtained by linking records from Medicare enrollment and claims data to records from the National Trauma Data Bank registry. However, data confidentiality restrictions limit the availability of unique identifiers to link records from these two datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage is the process of identifying entries across two files that represent the same entity. Record linkage methods can be broadly classified into deterministic and probabilistic techniques. Deterministic techniques identify links by examining whether data elements existing in both files agree in value (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gomatam et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite>). These methods yield a high proportion of true links among record pairs that are linked. However, deterministic techniques may miss a large number of true links when the data elements are subject to typographical errors, differences in coding systems, or missingness (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Campbell et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>). Probabilistic record linkage leverages a mixture model proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fellegi and Sunter (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1969</a>)</cite> to calculate probabilities that a pair of records from the two datasets represent a true link. This approach commonly employs a greedy algorithm to select the record pairs with the highest probabilities of being true links. Record pairs below a probability cutoff value are either sent for clerical review or classified as non-links. Both deterministic and probabilistic linking methods may utilize optimization procedures to obtain one-to-one linking configurations (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jaro (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite>). These optimization steps enforce a dependency structure among possible links using linking probabilities that are estimated independently. This process may result in suboptimal linking configurations (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Belin and Rubin (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite>). Furthermore, many deterministic and probabilistic methods do not provide a mechanism to quantify the uncertainty in the linking process when analyzing the linked datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Bayesian record linkage procedures are probabilistic record linkage techniques that were proposed as possible solutions to address these limitations. These Bayesian procedures introduce a missing linkage structure that is sampled together with model parameters. Constraints can be placed on the linkage structure to directly obtain one-to-one linking configurations, eliminating the need for additional post-processing steps. One type of Bayesian record linkage procedure relies on models that describe similarity measures between variables appearing in both files using a mixture of matches and non-matches (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fortini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Larsen (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>). A different set of Bayesian methods relies on measurement error models to describe a set of observed discrete matching variables rather than similarity measures (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>). Both types of Bayesian methods rely on variables contained in both files, but do not consider variables that appear in only one of the files. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gutman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> proposes an approach that utilizes relationships between variables that appear in only one of the files, as well as those appearing in both files to link records. One attractive property of Bayesian record linkage procedures is that they account for errors in the linking process by using samples from the posterior distribution of the linkage structures. These samples can then be used to obtain unbiased point estimates and statistically valid interval estimates (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gutman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Identifying all entities across two datasets can be computationally complex, especially with large numbers of records in each file. Blocking, or indexing, is commonly implemented in record linkage to reduce computation and improve the scalability of linkage algorithms by only considering record pairs that agree on a set of blocking fields (e.g. address, gender, etc.) (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Newcombe and Kennedy (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">1962</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fellegi and Sunter (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1969</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Newcombe (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">1988</a>)</cite>). A major limitation of blocking, similar to that of deterministic linking, is that variables used to block records may have different values across files (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jaro (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Winkler (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite>). These differences may place records in the wrong block, resulting in missed true links and possible false links. To address this limitation, blocking methods that partition record pairs into groups based on similarity of the blocking fields rather than exact agreement have been proposed (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Baxter (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Christen (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>). These methods prioritize reducing the dimension of the linkage problem while maintaining a high proportion of true links that are identified. These blocking procedures are sensitive to errors among the blocking fields, and they do not adjust for potential errors in the blocking process in a subsequent analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Dalzell and Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> extended the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gutman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> to account for possible errors within blocking variables. The extended method assumes that the values of blocking fields may be recorded with errors, and it allows for individual records to shift between blocks. Multiple blocking variable values and linkage structures are sampled from the posterior distribution in order to propagate the errors in the blocking and linking processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">All of these blocking methods assume that the blocking variables are recorded in both files. However, they do not address cases where the blocking variable represent similar entities in both files, but unique identifiers are not available to match blocks across files. Specifically, in healthcare settings, patients receive care according to providers (hospitals, nursing-homes, physicians, etc.). These providers create a natural blocking scheme. However, because of confidentiality restrictions, providers’ identifiers are unique to each file. Thus, patients receiving treatment from the same provider can be identified within each file separately, but the providers cannot be easily linked across files. In scenarios with limited discriminating information, leveraging the information that entities received care from similar providers can improve linkage accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a Bayesian multi-layer record linkage method that identifies providers and the corresponding entities treated within each provider. This method has improved linkage accuracy when providers’ and individuals’ linking variables are limited in their quality of information or are prone to error. The algorithm generates multiple linked datasets, which propagates the uncertainty generated from the linking processes, resulting in valid statistical inferences. We implement the proposed method to examine the associations between functional status assessments and TBI patients’ ability to be independent following their injury by linking records from Medicare enrollment records and claims data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to patient records in the National Trauma Data Bank.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.14" class="ltx_p">Linking two files is not commonly the goal of many studies; instead, researchers seek to estimate associations between variables that exist within the merged dataset. The proposed linking algorithm is computationally intensive. Moreover, performing both record linkage and the subsequent analysis within the Bayesian framework is even more computationally intensive. One possible solution is to use a multiple imputation algorithm to average over estimates of the linkage structures (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gutman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>). Specifically, we generate multiple linked datasets using the proposed procedure, analysis is performed separately on each dataset, and overall point and interval estimates are obtained through common combining rules (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rubin (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>). This procedure properly propagates the error in the linkage while reducing the computation.

Area income is compared by determining whether the absolute difference between two blocks was less than 500. The continuous age values are converted to date of birth (DOB) with a year, month, and day of birth. We performed two simulation configurations for linking DOB. Day of birth is included in the linkage process in one configuration, while it is withheld in the other to mimic confidentiality restrictions. We present the results when day of birth is withheld in this section, and provide results when it is included in Appendix D.</p>

This suggests that when the information among record-level linking variables is weak (e.g. large errors among identifying variables), and there are no errors among blocking variables, it may be advantageous to separate the block-level and record-level linkage to prevent the record-level errors from negatively impacting the block-level linkage. However, with the introduction of errors in the blocking variables, MLBRL performs significantly better than CIBRL even in scenarios with large errors in the record-level linking variables.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Figure 2 shows the average log-probability matrix among the true block pairs and true link record pairs using MLBRL, CIBRL, and BRL across 100 datasets that includes day of birth as a linking variable and without error there is 40% error among Region, Area Income, and DOB month. In an ideal scenario, we would expect the diagonal values to be close 0, which would indicate probabilities close to 1 for the correct classification of true linking block and record-level pairs. Figure 2a shows that the block-level classification when using CIBRL can be inaccurate as some of the off-diagonal block pairs also have log-probability values that are close to 0, whereas MLBRL is robust to errors in the block-level variables (Figure 2b). Because BRL does not constrain the record-level linkage to blocks, it results in records within one block being linked to records from multiple blocks in the other file (Figure 2c). This indicates poor record-level linkage when the error rate is high. Figure 2d shows that CIBRL is able to estimate the record-level linkage well within block-pairs that are correctly identified, but the record-level estimation suffers in blocks with significant uncertainty that are incorrectly paired. MLBRL estimates the blocking structure well even with high block-level errors, and it estimates the record-level linkage accurately (Figure 2e).</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A large portion of older patients with TBI requiring post-acute care are discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which are designed to provide constant nursing care and assistance with daily activities for its residents (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tepas et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lueckel et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>). This group often has lower functional status and worse clinical measures than those that are discharged home directly. While the number of older patients with TBI who are discharged to SNFs has steadily increased, a discharge policy that outlines the types of patients with TBI that should be released to SNF does not exist. In order to examine the recovery potential within SNFs, it is necessary to estimate the relationships between a patient’s pre-existing and injury-related clinical characteristics and their health outcomes following admission to SNF. To assess these relationships, we link TBI inpatient admissions that occurred between 2011-2015 among patients 65 and older within a well defined sample of burn bed hospitals (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Klein et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>) from two data sources: the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), and Medicare enrollment and claims data.</p>

Data is submitted by a trauma registrar and includes details of facility characteristics, individual demographics and comorbid conditions, all ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes pertaining to the injury, and discharge disposition. Additionally, the registry contains standardized injury severity indices including the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), which is an assessment of consciousness recorded at emergency department admission, and the head Abbreviated Injury Scale (hAIS), which catalogues the severity of head related trauma injuries.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While the point estimate for the number of linked records obtained by BRL and CIBRL is not significantly different, the true link composition given by BRL is different from the links estimated by CIBRL and MLBRL. Under CIBRL and MLBRL, the records within each hospital in the NTDB can only be linked to records from one hospital in the Medicare file at each MCMC iteration. Using BRL, an average of 60.3% of linked records from hospitals in the NTDB belong to the most frequently paired hospital from the Medicare file (95% CI: [58.4%, 62.0%]). The remaining 39.7% of linked records comprise an average of 9.52 different hospitals among the posterior samples, with a 95% credible interval of [9.16, 9.87]. This suggests that BRL may produce linkage estimates with high error levels.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to BRL and CIBRL, MLBRL yields a higher average number of linked records with a wider credible interval. The incorporation of the patient-level linkage in making linkage decisions between hospitals enables MLBRL to better link hospitals of similar patient sizes. This translates to more true links being identified in blocks that are correctly paired.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For each imputed complete dataset obtained using BRL, CIBRL, and MLBRL, we form an analytic sample of individuals who are Medicare fee-for-service 100 days following their initial hospital admission. The outcome of interest is whether an individual admitted to SNF following TBI is able to return to the community within 100 days after discharge from a hospital. We examine the association between the outcome and hAIS and tCGS measures separately. To estimate this association, we adjusted for demographic characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions as listed in Table 4. Excluding the variables that are exclusive to the NTDB, we use the Medicare reported values for all of the remaining variables in our analysis. Two logistic regression models were examined for hAIS and tGCS separately:</p>

Table 6 provides the summaries for the estimated marginal odds ratios and 95% credible intervals of hAIS and GCS using the three linkage methods. Overall, hAIS and GCS are not found to be significantly associated with successful discharge from SNF after 100 days in any of the three linkage methods. The odds of returning to the community among individuals with high AIS scores (e.g. more severe injury severity) are estimated to be 0.987, 0.993, or 0.990 times less than those with low AIS scores (e.g. more mild injury severity) using linked samples from BRL, CIBRL, and MLBRL respectively. All three methods estimate that the odds of returning to the community are higher for individuals with lower functional status, as recorded by the tGCS. The estimated odds ratio with MLBRL is similar to those obtained by BRL or CIBRL (1.004 vs 1.002 or 1.001). Narrower interval estimates for the odds ratios are obtained by data linked using MLBRL than those obtained using BRL or CIBRL, which is a result of the higher number of linked records.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing Bayesian record linkage methods work well when the linking variables are informative with low error rates. However, their performance can suffer when the linking information is limited with potential errors. These scenarios occur frequently in applications involving large public health datasets. We present a multi-layer Bayesian record linkage approach that simultaneously estimates the linkage of unlabeled block partitions between the two files and the individual records nested within each block. This approach results in higher accuracy when estimating both the record-level and block-level linkages. The algorithm also enables researchers to obtain point estimates and interval estimates that reflect the uncertainty in the block-level and record-level linkages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Using simulations, we compare the performance of our newly proposed algorithm to an existing Bayesian record linkage method and an algorithm that considers blocking and linking independently. In simulations, the proposed method generally provides the highest TPR, PPV, F1 score, and block accuracy across different configurations of error rates among the blocking and linking variables. This demonstrates that the record-level linkage can greatly benefit from incorporating blocking structure constraints. Even without any errors in the block-level and record-level variables, MLBRL and CIBRL reduce the number of false links identified compared to BRL. When linking variables are recorded with errors, MLBRL and CIBRL identify more true links compared to BRL. These results appear in the real data analysis where many patients receiving care in the same hospital in one file are linked to patients from multiple hospitals in the other file. CIBRL has lower TPR and F1 score compared to MLBRL when errors exist in the blocking fields. This implies that CIBRL relies heavily on the accuracy of block-level variables, and the assumed independence between the block-level linkage and the record-level linkage may limit this method to scenarios where the block-level variables are recorded with high accuracy. MLBRL correctly identifies the blocking structure with higher accuracy when errors exist among block-level variables. This suggests that incorporating the record-level linkages within block-level linkage results in an algorithm that is more robust to errors among blocking variables. CIBRL performs more favorably with large amounts of error among record-level variables and little error among block-level variables. This is because large error among the record-level variables may negatively impact the relatively accurate block-level linkage when using MLBRL. Commonly in health related datasets, different instruments are used to record providers’ characteristics and their values may differ across files. Thus, expecting little error in block-level variables may not be plausible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We did not find significant associations between different injury scores and release to the community. Point estimates show that higher tGCS may indicate lower odds of returning to the community after 100 days. While these associations might be contrary to our expectations, the head abbreviated injury severity score and Glasgow coma scores are taken at the beginning of patients’ traumatic brain injury at hospital admission. Thus, these may not be reflective of the treatment a patient receives and their recovery during their inpatient stay. Our models show that these scores are not good predictors of recovery among individuals who are assigned to SNF.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While the method described in this paper present a novel approach to increase robustness to record-level linkage, several future extensions can be pursued. In the current approach, we assume that the record-level linking parameters do not vary across blocks. A possible extension is to adopt principles from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Larsen (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite> and allow linking variables to vary between blocks using hierarchical prior distributions. Another extension is to incorporate relationships between variables that are exclusive to one file in the block-level linkage and the record level linkage. Lastly, the current algorithm is computationally intensive and development of more computationally efficient algorithms that propagate the errors in the linkage is an area of further research. Possible approaches may rely on the algorithms proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zanella (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, we propose a new record linkage approach that simultaneously estimates block-level and record-level linkage. This new procedure results in improved linkage accuracy and propagates the errors in the linkage status in subsequent analysis through a multiple imputation approach. This algorithm can be used in other settings with limited linking information where there is a known partitioning structure (e.g. individuals within families) within each file that cannot be linked using unique identifiers.</p>

<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Trauma hospital linking characteristics include: hospital region, bed size, hospital trauma level, and the presence of pediatric beds. In addition, we derived block-level variables that indicate the presence of rare or severe traumatic injuries and procedures commonly associated with these injuries using the ICD-9-CM codes for all hospitalization events occurring at that facility among individuals 65 and older in 2015. These codes were identified in the NTDB and Medicare files using patient level information. The variables were defined as 1 if at least one patient record treated at the hospital included these codes, and 0 otherwise. Appendix Table 7 details the diagnosis and procedure codes that were derived from ICD-9-CM codes, as well as the codes used to identify traumatic brain injury.</p>
