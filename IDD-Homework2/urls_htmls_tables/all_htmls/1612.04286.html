<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage is the process of identifying records that refer to
the same entities from several databases. This process is challenging
because commonly no unique entity identifiers are available. Linkage
therefore has to rely on partially identifying attributes, such as
names and addresses of people. Recent years have seen the development
of novel techniques for linking data from diverse application areas,
where a major focus has been on linking complex data that contain
records about different types of entities. Advanced approaches that
exploit both the similarities between record attributes as well as the
relationships between entities to identify clusters of matching
records have been developed.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this application paper we study the novel problem where rather than
different types of entities we have databases where the same entity
can have different roles, and where these roles change over time. We
specifically develop novel techniques for linking historical birth,
death, marriage and census records with the aim to reconstruct the
population covered by these records over a period of several decades.
Our experimental evaluation on real Scottish data shows that even with
advanced linkage techniques that consider group, relationship, and
temporal aspects it is challenging to achieve high quality linkage
from such complex data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage, also known as entity resolution, data matching or
duplicate detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, is the process of
identifying and linking records about the same real-world entity from
one or several databases. This process is widely used in the data
preparation phase of data mining projects that require data from
various sources to be integrated before they can be analyzed.
Traditionally, record linkage has been employed in the health sector
and for national censuses, while more recently it has seen application
in a wide range of areas including e-commerce, the social sciences,
crime and fraud detection, and national
security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Much research in record linkage is based on bibliographic data (with
the aim to identify which publications have been written by the same
authors) due to the easy availability of large bibliographic databases
when compared to personal data about people (such as health or
government records) that are often sensitive or
confidential <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Bibliographic data also have the advantage of containing several types
of entities (like authors, publications, and venues). These provide a
complex information space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> that allows graph-based and
clustering techniques to exploit both attribute similarities (such as
similar publication titles) as well as relationships (for example two
authors have co-written several publications). Several advanced graph
and collective linkage techniques have been developed for
bibliographic data in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The question of how to employ such advanced linkage techniques on
personal data (such as names, addresses, dates of birth, etc.) has
however so far only seen very limited research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
A major reason for this is the lack of available real-world databases
about people.
Most approaches used to link personal data are still based on
traditional techniques that only consider pair-wise record
comparisons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. These techniques classify each record pair
individually as either a <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">match</em> (assumed to refer to the same
entity) or a <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-match</em> (assumed to refer to different entities)
without considering relationships between records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have seen a significant increase in interest on how to
efficiently and effectively link large databases about people, with
the aim to reconstruct populations for social science and health
research, or for use as a valuable resource for governments and
businesses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The emerging field of <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">population
informatics</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> is aimed at the linkage and analysis of
large and dynamic databases that contain information about
people, such as the health, education, financial, census, location,
shopping, employment, and social networking records of a large
proportion of individuals in a population.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to bibliographic data with their different types of entities,
population databases contain records about people where the role of an
individual can change over time, and where different databases contain
different types of information about the same individual. Furthermore,
the different roles of individuals lead to various types of
relationships and diverse constraints (with regard to roles, time, and
number of individuals involved in a link).</p>

Sect. <a href="#S5" title="5 Experiments and Discussion ‣ Application of Advanced Record Linkage Techniques for Complex Population Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. For each of the pairs of roles shown (for
example <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Baby–Bride</em>), different attributes (fields) are
available for calculating the similarities between records, different
temporal constraints are possible (for example, a <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Baby</em> can only
become a <em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Bride</em> after a certain age), and different 1-to-1 or
1-to-many linkage restrictions need to be considered (a <em id="S1.p7.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Baby</em>
can be a <em id="S1.p7.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Bride</em> in one or more marriages, but each <em id="S1.p7.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Bride</em>
can only have been a <em id="S1.p7.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Baby</em> once).</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The linkage of such data is challenging due to people moving around
(address changes), changing their names (either in the form of small
spelling variations or errors, or full name changes due to marriage),
and other data quality issues such as transcription or scanning errors
when these certificates were converted from their original handwritten
into digital form (as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Application of Advanced Record Linkage Techniques for Complex Population Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). People in
the 19th century also did not always know their exact date of birth or
even their true age, leading to inaccurate age values in certificates.
Additionally, the variety of personal names was much more limited (as
Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.6 Result Fusion ‣ 4 Complex Population Linkage ‣ Application of Advanced Record Linkage Techniques for Complex Population Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows for our data sets), and often only a few
common names covered a large proportion of a population. This means
that, compared to many modern databases, the use of attribute
similarities does not provide enough information to distinguish
between individuals.</p>

<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the various types of relationships can help improve

similarity to a <em id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Bride</em> and her parents in a marriage

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The challenges of how to link records about the same entities within
and across databases have been investigated in various research
domains since the 1950s. Several recent books provide an overview of
the topic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
In the following we describe related work specifically aimed at
linking complex data. These approaches include group, graph and
collective techniques that consider data that contain temporal
aspects, or that are specific to linking (historical) census and
similar types of personal data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional record linkage techniques only consider the similarities
between record attributes mainly using approximate string comparison
functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, followed by the individual
classification of each compared record pair as a match or a non-match.
On et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> were the first to investigate how to link groups
of records in the context of bibliographic data (such as groups of
papers written by the same author) using a weighted bipartite matching
approach. While this approach still classifies each pair of groups of
records independently from all others, recently developed collective
techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> additionally also consider the
relationships between entities. They build a graph of all compared
records that is clustered such that each cluster refers to one entity.
For bibliographic data, the available relationships include authors
who have co-authored together, or who work at the same institution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These group and graph-based techniques have been developed in the
context of bibliographic data, where several types of entities are
available. Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> were the first to investigate how
group linkage techniques can be employed in the context of
(historical) census data by using household information to group
records with the aim of linking individuals by first linking similar
households. Experimental results showed that this approach can lead
to a significant reduction of ambiguous links between individuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While most record linkage techniques do not consider temporal aspects,
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and Chiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> investigated
temporal information in the context of bibliographic data where
authors can change their affiliations over time. Their approach
adjusts similarity weights depending upon the temporal differences
between two records. Christen and Gayler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> developed a
similar approach for personal data where temporal likelihood values,
such as how likely it is that somebody moves address over a certain
period of time, are learned from a large population database. In our
approach we also consider temporal relationships between records, for
example that a birth has to occur before any other records of the
same person, or that a marriage or birth of a child can only occur
once a person has reached a certain age.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To improve linkage quality, various supervised learning techniques
have been developed specifically aimed at linking (historical) census
data. Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> investigated multiple instance learning by
first linking individuals with high confidence, and then using those
to link households over time. More recently, the same
authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> exploited information in households that does not
change over time (such as the age differences between a husband and
wife) within a graph-matching approach to improve the quality of
linking census data over time. Antoine et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> used a
support vector machine classifier to successfully link two large
Canadian census data sets from 1871 and 1881.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The main drawback of supervised approaches is their reliance on
training data, which generally have to be manually prepared by domain
experts in an expensive and time consuming process. Our approach, on
the other hand, is unsupervised and aims to exploit the relationships
between individuals and their changing roles over time to achieve
high linkage quality.</p>

compared or not, similar constraints can also be applied at the level
of linking pairs of certificates in the relational and group linkage
steps. At this level, temporal constraints ensure that certificate
links are limited to valid time periods. For example, a marriage and a
census certificate can be linked in different ways. One is to link the
bride and her parents to an earlier census certificate of this family,
while another way is to link the bride and groom to a later census
certificate as a new family.</p>

linked. For example, a birth and marriage certificate can be linked in
the following three ways: (1) a baby girl is linked to her marriage,
(2) a baby boy is linked to his marriage, and (3) a baby’s parents are
linked to their marriage. For each such linkage type, we define the

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of real Scottish
data sets that cover the population of the Isle of Skye over the
period from 1861 to 1901. These data sets have been extensively
curated and linked semi-manually (using database queries to extract
tables of possible links) by demographers who are experts in the
domain of linking such historical data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The linkage approach taken by the demographers followed long
established rules for family reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, leading to
set of linked certificates that are heavily biased towards certain
types of links (as we discuss further below). As an example, a first
step in family reconstruction is often to link babies who had died
very shortly after birth (as these do not exhibit much variation or
changes in the names and addresses of their parents), followed by the
linking of birth certificates to their next census certificate (less
than ten years in the future for our data sets).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We thus have a set of manually generated links that allow us to
compare the quality and coverage of our automatically identified links
to those identified by the domain experts. We like to emphasize that
<em id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">we do not have a gold standard of all true links in these data
sets</em> (neither do the demographers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>). All results
presented here therefore only indicate the overlap between manual and

advanced relational similarity methods. For group linkage, no clear

including missing attribute values seems to lead to slightly better

and limiting census links to the closest temporal census certificates
can improve linkage quality. Finally, applying 1-to-1 and 1-to-many
constraints does significantly improve the quality of group linkage,
however it does not lead to improvements for relational linkage
methods.</p>

However, it seems advanced linkage techniques developed for
bibliographic data cannot be directly used for linking complex
personal data, such as the ones we aim to link in our work. More
development of new linkage techniques that better exploit the
contents, roles, temporal aspects, and relationships between
individuals and groups, is therefore required.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a novel approach to link complex personal data from
(historical) birth, death, marriage, and census certificates. Our
approach combines individual, group, and relational linkage methods,
and incorporates temporal, as well as 1-to-1 and 1-to-many linkage
constraints. An experimental evaluation on real Scottish data
highlighted the challenges of linking such complex data, where no
approach achieved high linkage quality compared to a careful manual
linkage as conducted by domain experts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. For these
specific data sets, we see the main reason for this to be the large
number of intrinsically difficult to link cases that were manually
linked by the domain experts despite not having high attribute,
relational, or group similarities; or having highly ambiguous name or
address values.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As future work we aim to improve each step of our automatic linkage
approach, starting with pair-wise similarity calculations that are
suitable for the highly skewed frequency distributions of attribute
values. We plan to explore different blocking techniques, such as the
sorted neighborhood method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, to improve the scalability of
our approach, and we aim to incorporate a fully relational collective
entity resolution approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and evaluate how this can
improve linkage quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While currently the role pair types used to limit pair-wise individual
comparisons are set manually based on domain expertise, we plan to
investigate if association or pattern mining algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>
can help to automatically identify role pairs that are likely to
correspond to true changes of people’s roles over time. Finally, we
plan to refine the temporal linkage constraints by calculating
fine-tuned temporal similarity adjustments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Our
overall goal is to develop highly accurate, scalable, and automatic
techniques for linking large-scale complex population databases.</p>
