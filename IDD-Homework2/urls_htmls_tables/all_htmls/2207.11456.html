<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Privacy, security and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the integration of cross-silo data, which inherits the development of the Internet of Things.
Federated learning is proposed to ensure that all parties can collaboratively complete the training task while the data is not out of the local.
Vertical federated learning is a specialization of federated learning for distributed features.
To preserve privacy, homomorphic encryption is applied to enable encrypted operations without decryption.
Nevertheless, together with a robust security guarantee, homomorphic encryption brings extra communication and computation overhead. In this paper, we analyze the current bottlenecks of vertical federated learning under homomorphic encryption comprehensively and numerically.
We propose a straggler-resilient and computation-efficient accelerating system that reduces the communication overhead in heterogeneous scenarios by 65.26% at most and reduces the computation overhead caused by homomorphic encryption by 40.66% at most. Our system can improve the robustness and efficiency of the current vertical federated learning framework without loss of security.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data fuels the growing popularity of the Internet of Things.
With the ubiquitous deployment of dedicated and multi-purpose sensors, collecting real-time information about our environment is becoming more convenient.
However, due to the specific limitations of dedicated sensors, information collected by different industries tends to have divergent feature dimensions.
This divergence makes cross-silo training and inferring challenging.
The traditional method is to establish a centralized data center led by relevant authorities.
Although this can break the data isolation, it is not feasible today.
Because of the tremendous value of this real-time information, such convenient access to monitor surroundings makes people concerned about the leakage and abuse of their private and sensitive data.
Apart from the individual privacy concern, the implementation of user privacy laws such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> has set a strict limit on the usage of the collected data.
Therefore, cross-silo data sharing becomes challenging, which hinders the development of the Internet of Things.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve this dilemma, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> was proposed by Google in 2016.
FL ensures that all parties can collaboratively complete the training task while the data is not out of the local, which is an ideal framework to alleviate privacy concerns.
However, most FL research focuses on the sample partitioned scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, where all cooperators share the same feature dimension.
The feature partitioned federated learning is rarely explored in literature, which is an equally important issue in real industrial scenarios, such as recommender system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, credit evaluation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a specialization of federated learning for distributed features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, economic and medical institutions have divergent feature dimension.
They build a federated model together without exchanging raw data.
To further preserve privacy, federated model is in safekeeping by a third-party authority, which prohibits each institution from getting model structure of others.
Unlike conventional FL (or noted horizontal FL) for distributed samples, which has been researched a lot due to its continuous line with traditional distributed learning, VFL is under-studied for the lack of datasets and benchmarks.
Apart from the lack of related infrastructure, communication redundancy in VFL is considerably larger than in conventional FL.
Because not only gradients are transmitted during cooperation, intermediate results such as labels and loss are needed to be exchanged due to distributed features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Homomorphic encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, a common privacy-preserving technology, is applied to provide secure protection of exchanged information.
Apart from HE, differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and coded computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> can be applied to preserve the privacy as well.
However, they are vulnerable to aggressive Bayesian restoration attacks due to their randomization privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
Considering that cooperators in VFL training need to have fruitful data features for effective collaborative training, they tend to be competitive enterprises in certain fields, such as industry, finance, medicine, etc.
Such a potential adversarial relationship resorts to the most strict privacy preservation for these precious data.
HE ensures security by allowing encrypted operations without decryption and thus providing cryptographic privacy protection.
Consequently, HE is studied as our focus of privacy preservation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, in addition to the robust security guarantee, HE leads to two orders of magnitude size inflation of the original data after encryption, which burdens the communication and incurs massive delays.
For example, a few-minute local training task will take dozens of minutes or even hours to complete in VFL under homomorphic encryption.
This extra delay, together with the common heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> existing in cooperation learning, damages the runtime performance of VFL.
To make matters worse, unlike conventional FL, parties in vertical federated learning can not compute gradients locally due to the lack of labels.
To compute the gradient, they need to exchange the encrypted intermediate results.
Computational costs under homomorphic encryption are much higher than that under plain text.
Huge computation overhead further slows down vertical federated learning under homomorphic encryption.</p>

As for communication overhead, we use a straggler-resilient scheme based on backup worker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to alleviate the overhead caused by heterogeneity.
For computation overhead, we compress the input matrix based on the principal component analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and reduce the computational redundancy caused by homomorphic encryption.
Our system reduces the communication overhead in heterogeneous scenarios range 13.99%-65.26% with different network situations and backup worker settings, and reduces the computation overhead caused by HE range 21.95%-40.66% with different degrees of compression.
Our system can significantly improve the efficiency of the current vertical federated learning without loss of security.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from conventional FL, each cooperator has a different feature dimension in vertical federated learning.
Apart from distributed features, in order to preserve privacy, labels of cooperators will not be shared with others.
In other words, only the cooperator who seeks collaboration owns the labels.
We note that the cooperator seeking collaboration and owing labels as Guest.
And those who attend the collaboration are called Hosts.
The lack of labels and features directly leads to the fact that cooperators can not compute loss locally and thus fail to compute gradients.
So conventional federated learning procedure is not feasible in vertical federated learning.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hardy et al. propose a secure cooperative learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for vertical data using additional homomorphic encryption.
The framework is as precise as a naive non-private solution that brings all data in one place and scales to problems with millions of entities with hundreds of features.
It consists of two parts.
The first part is encrypted entity alignment.
Considering that data samples of different partners are not the same, the system utilizes many encryption allocation schemes to locate these common data samples in multiple parties.
In this process, the data information that does not coincide with each other will not be disclosed.
The second part is encrypted model training, which is the focus of our work.
After encrypted entity alignment, it can be assumed that the data samples of all parties are consistent, but the feature spaces of all parties do not coincide.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A Vertical Federated Learning Architecture ‣ II Background and Motivation ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, before the training, the authoritative arbiter randomly generates the private key and public key.
Then the arbiter distributes the public key to each cooperator for encryption.
Note that cooperators have no right or opportunity to obtain the private key.
That is, cooperators have only the right to encrypt, but not the right to decrypt, which ensures that the interactive data is presented in ciphertext.
During one iteration, each cooperator first completes the forward propagation and obtains the intermediate results in plain mode.
After encrypting the intermediate result with their own public key, cooperators exchange the encrypted intermediate results.
Then they can gather a complete encrypted loss, containing the data feature information of other parties and label information.
They use the encrypted loss to compute encrypted gradients and send encrypted gradients to arbiter for decryption.
After decrypting their respective gradients, the arbiter will return the separated gradient parameters to each cooperator.</p>

Similarly, the result of ciphertext exponentiation after decryption is equivalent to plaintext multiplication.
Note that the size of ciphertext tends to be excessively bigger than the size of plaintext.
For example, the commonly used plaintext is 8-bit or 16-bit, while the shortest ciphertext is 2048-bit till 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
Homomorphic encryption will greatly increase the complexity of the operation, especially for multiplication.</p>

to show the performance bottleneck intuitively.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-C Performance Bottleneck ‣ II Background and Motivation ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, vertical federated learning mainly consists of four parts, namely <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Computation, Encryption, Communication</em> and <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Other</em> operation.
<em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Other</em> operation is the time of IO operations and task scheduling.
Since encryption has a negligible impact on IO operations, we can reasonably assume that time consumption of <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Other</em> is static (100s) in all three modes, and use it as a comparing reference.
Plain mode stands for vertical federated learning without homomorphic encryption and heterogeneity, where <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Other</em> covers the most running time.
Encrypt mode stands for vertical federated learning under homomorphic encryption without network heterogeneity, which means that no straggler will appear.
In encrypt mode, <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Computation</em> consumes most of time, <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Encryption</em> consumes second.
Hetero-encrypt mode is vertical federated learning in practical deployment, where both homomorphic encryption and heterogeneity are involved.
In hetero-encrypt mode, <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Communication</em> surpasses in reverse.
Among those three bottlenecks, the increase in encryption time is common, which has been widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
So we dive into those two specific bottlenecks: computation overhead and communication overhead.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the horizontal federated learning, the parameters transmitted in the vertical federated learning are not only gradients, but also intermediate results.
Moreover, due to the potential competitive relationship, all parties do not have the authority to decrypt the parameters to preserve privacy.
This means that homomorphic encryption not only brings the redundancy contained in the encryption and decryption computation itself, but also forces all parties to do computation on ciphertext instead of plaintext.
And the ciphertext computation of homomorphic encryption is very time-consuming, especially for multiplication.

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneous networks and huge geographical spans are the main reasons for communication overhead.
More specifically, multiple institutions with different features may be distributed in all corners of the earth, and their geographical positions are generally considerably different.
Moreover, the network condition of a single organization is difficult to ensure stability due to the network heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
Because each institution itself has limited communication resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, such as carrier, bandwidth, e.t.c.
These resources may be allocated to other jobs, as cooperators do not exist exclusively for federated learning.
These services will bring huge network traffic during the peak hours, and even lead to network congestion.
What is worse, homomorphic encryption will expand the data size, which amplifies the impact of network fluctuation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above two bottlenecks cause much idle time in vertical federated learning.

As mentioned in Section <a href="#S2" title="II Background and Motivation ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>,
the network environment is likely to be heterogeneous and volatile. The existing synchronization framework
will lead to much idle time, which will damage the efficiency and robustness of the training process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The simple idea is to discard the unreachable parameters, which is effective in distributed learning because only gradients are transmitted from partial workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
But considering the difference between VFL and conventional distributed learning, such an arbitrary drop scheme may not perform well in VFL. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A Vertical Federated Learning Architecture ‣ II Background and Motivation ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, cooperators in VFL exchange gradients with arbiter to decrypt gradient instead of aggregating gradients.
This means that dropping gradients can block the learning progress or degrade the clients to training locally without collaboration.
Variables transmitted between cooperators are encrypted intermediate results, which will be used for gradient computation.
So arbitrary discard will inevitably damage training performance. The disadvantage of this method is magnified in the longitudinal federated learning, because some clients will accumulate such damages and turn into performance stragglers, which means its misleading drags the global performance.</p>

The backup scheme can be various, such as average, local prediction and so on. For the convenience of discussion, the simplest method is chosen, that is, to fill the unreceived parameters with the results in the previous iteration. The experimental part below shows that even this simple scheme has better effects than the arbitrary discard scheme.</p>

Backup worker allows distributed workers to use older, stale versions of model’s values (gradients and logits).
This significantly helps workers to spend more time on computing instead of idle waiting.
Furthermore, the SSP model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> can ensures the correctness of ML algorithm by limiting the maximum age of the stale values.
Considering a nearly half proportion of encrypted computation in VFL training (shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-C Performance Bottleneck ‣ II Background and Motivation ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), common network fluctuation (the best network bandwidth is within one magnitude of the worst) will not incur the age of stale value <math id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\geqq" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">≧</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1b"><geq id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1"></geq></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1c">\geqq</annotation></semantics></math> 2.
In this circumstance, the SSP model can perform on par with vanilla synchronous training.
Note that our system does not use any intelligence client selection mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, but is compatible with above techniques.
These techniques can be injected to further ensure the upper bound of the stale age.</p>

The computation overhead of plaintext is nearly negligible compared to that of ciphertext multiplication.
And our compression behavior is recoverable by storing the PCA matrix locally.
It avoids the inexplicability caused by compressing features on the air, and ensures that the algorithm can perfectly fit the existing VFL framework without enormous modification.</p>

We evaluate our system performance under two different heterogeneous network environments with a baseline bandwidth of 10Mb.
The degree of heterogeneity is quantified by the possibility of slow down, i.e., reaching the bottom bandwidth (1/10 of baseline bandwidth) during network fluctuation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

The conventional backup scheme ignoring the unreceived parameters has a noticeable loss of convergence performance in three datasets.
This is because some critical information of the global training loss is dropped, leading to a huge deviation when computing encrypted gradients.
In contrast, compensating the unreceived parameters with the stale variants can effectively narrow the deviation when the staleness age is limited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and perform on par with vanilla VFL.</p>

Origin means vanilla VFL without optimization.
PCA converts the input dimension to the target compressed dimension.
In Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-C Principle Component Analysis ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> (a) and (c), our feature compression scheme that reduces the feature dimension to 60% does not cause a significant loss of accuracy on <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MIMIC-III</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">NUS-WIDE</span>.
It even converges faster due to the pre-analysis brought from PCA.
While on the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Epsilon</span> dataset shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-C Principle Component Analysis ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Accelerating Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> (b), training performance under PCA compression leads initially but fails a little when convergence.
In other word, although the data after the initial dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis performs better than the original method, the final training performance still suffers a certain degree of accuracy loss.
With the increase of compression degree, the loss of accuracy will become more apparent.
Reducing the feature dimension to 60% on <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Epsilon</span> will lose nearly 3% precision when convergence.
Such a ‘dataset affinity’ may come from the limitations of the principal component analysis, which compressed the feature dimension before training.
The compression degree of which should be cautiously decided according to the intrinsic correlation of datasets.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to get rid of the computation and communication redundancy caused by homomorphic encryption,
Hu et.al propose a novel vertical federated learning framework on the assumption of shared labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This assumption may be valid within a
single cilo. But when the scenario is extended to cross-cilo cooperation, many labels shall not be shared due to privacy regulation and corporate competition,
limiting it to be applied in large-scale industrial scenarios.
Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, VFL under homomorphic encryption is still the safest framework for cross-silo cooperating training except from multi-party secure computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, the efficiency of which is far from usability in practical.
Some works have been proposed to make homomorphic encryption more suitable for federated learning.
In the horizontal scenario, Wang et.al designed a new coding scheme
for the homomorphic encryption scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, which greatly reduces the redundancy of the homomorphic encryption scheme. However, the
assumption that all parties can decrypt data and calculate in local plaintext is difficult to hold in vertical federated
learning. Therefore, it can not solve the huge bottleneck of encrypted computation in vertical federated learning.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneity is the main bottleneck of cooperative learning. Conventional distributed learning adopts many efficient schemes to
eliminate the overhead caused by heterogeneity.
One traditional way is to reduce the impact of heterogeneity by increasing the degree of parallelism, such as pipeline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or selecting those similar clients or data to prevent heterogeneity ahead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Asynchronous training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> is another common paradigm. It solves the heterogeneity problem at
the cost of introducing the staleness, which damages the convergence performance of training. However, in the typical VFL framework, jobs are limited to be trained in a synchronized way. So common asynchronous optimization comes out of effect.
A new paradigm called backup worker was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we dive into the bottleneck of vertical federated learning under homomorphic encryption, and propose a practical and effective optimization system to accelerate current vertical federated learning through backup worker and principal component analysis.
The backup scheme improves the
efficiency and robustness of the communication network in the heterogeneous scenarios. Principal component analysis alleviates the computation overhead caused by homomorphic encryption.
Our system dramatically accelerates current vertical federated learning and promotes its practical deployment in safe cross-industry cooperation.
We will further optimize the performance and efficiency of vertical federated learning in the future, mainly in the following four directions.</p>

of FATE is completely redeveloped to ensure security. Hence, model hyper-parameters that perform well in traditional distributed learning can not be applied directly.

Auto-ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> can be used to automatically adjust parameters, so that the potential of VFL can be maximized.</p>

This tradeoff between computational efficiency and model accuracy is related to the tradeoff between privacy preserving and model accuracy for horizontal federated learning, which has been theoretically investigated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.

They tend to be competitive enterprises in certain fields, such as industry, finance, medicine, etc.
Attracting these enterprises to build collaboration is non-trivial.
The incentive mechanism design for VFL is a promising research topic to pave the way for practical VFL.
For example, rewarding the model owners based on their marginal contributions can ensure the stability of a federation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
And how to measure the reliability and contributions of the cooperators is a sophisticated optimization problem as well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Those important topics researched in conventional FL are equally meaningful in the VFL scenario.
We will design a reasonable and efficient incentive mechanism for modern VFL in the future.</p>
