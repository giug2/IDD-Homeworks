<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning approach where multiple parties can train a single model without sharing their raw training data.
Federated learning typically requires the utilization of multi-party computation techniques to provide strong privacy guarantees by ensuring that an untrusted or curious aggregator cannot obtain <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">isolated</span> replies from parties involved in the training process, thereby preventing potential inference attacks.
Until recently, it was thought that some of these secure aggregation techniques were sufficient to fully protect against inference attacks coming from a curious aggregator.
However, recent research has demonstrated that a curious aggregator can successfully launch a <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">disaggregation attack</span> to learn information about model updates of a target party.
This paper presents <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span>, an <span id="id2.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">efficient privacy-preserving federated learning framework</span> for addressing the lack of transparency that enables isolation attacks, such as disaggregation attacks, during secure aggregation by assuring that parties’ model updates are included in the aggregated model in a private and secure manner.
<span id="id2.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> proposes a decentralized trust consensus mechanism and incorporates a recently proposed decentralized functional encryption scheme in which all parties agree on a <span id="id2.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">participation matrix</span> before collaboratively generating decryption key fragments, thereby gaining control and trust over the secure aggregation process in a decentralized setting.
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DeTrust-FL outperforms state-of-the-art FE-based secure multi-party aggregation solutions in terms of training time and reduces the volume of data transferred. In contrast to existing approaches, this is achieved without creating any trust dependency on external trusted entities.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training machine learning (ML) models that generalize well and have good predictive accuracy requires good quality training data.
Traditionally, to train ML models, data is collected in a central place by the entities that run the training process.
This data oftentimes includes private information, whose use and transmission have been restricted by regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
To address privacy concerns and satisfy regulatory compliance, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising learning paradigm, where multiple parties can collaboratively train a single machine learning model without sharing any of its training data.
In other words, while traditional machine learning systems require the transmission of all training data to a single place, FL ensures that each data owner or party can maintain possession of their own data.
For this reason, FL represents a substantial privacy improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, an entity called <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregator</span> is introduced to orchestrate the learning process among multiple parties who own private data.
To train a model in FL, the aggregator sends an initial model to all parties, which then continue training it locally using their private data. Then, each party sends to the aggregator model parameters, e.g., gradients, which are known as <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model updates</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
The aggregator then combines or fuses all model updates received creating a single shared ML model.
These steps are repeated multiple <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rounds</span>, and in each of them, the aggregator shares with the parties a new model and parties train and send back model updates. Private data is never transmitted from the party; only model updates are shared with the aggregator.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In FL all training data remains with the party who owns it, providing basic privacy.
However, this simple FL setup still leaves room for <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inference attacks</span> that enable adversaries to obtain
information about the training data used by each party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
The risk of private information leakage may be intolerable in some scenarios, and hence, multiple defenses
to prevent these threats have been proposed including differential privacy (DP) and secure multi-party computation (SMC).
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">SMC approaches protect privacy of the input through cryptographic techniques
to ensure that a curious or mistrusted aggregator cannot see individual model updates.
Popular SMC approaches include (partial) homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, threshold Paillier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, functional encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and pairwise masking protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, to mitigate inference attacks that use the final model or model updates,
DP injects a carefully tuned amount of noise into model updates using differentially private mechanisms.
While DP provides strong privacy guarantees, approaches relying on DP are notorious for producing noisy models with lower accuracy.
Other solutions to prevent data leakage cleverly combine DP and SMC techniques to provide strong differential private guarantees while still enabling good model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, existing SMC techniques are not sufficient to prevent inference threats for the following reasons.
First, the lack transparency in the aggregation process results in an absence of
guarantee that all of the received model updates will be included in a certain round of the FL process.
Hence, a malicious aggregator can avoid including a target model update(s) in the secure
aggregation process leading to multiple problems.
Besides enabling inference attacks, a model produced by ignoring certain model updates may not generalize well for all participants or lead to unfairness in its predictions.
In an <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">isolation attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,
a malicious aggregator may try to segregate certain replies
by ignoring some of the received model updates to later on infer private information from a target party, thus violating its privacy. These attacks completely overthrow the purpose of SMC.
Additionally, secure aggregation techniques are vulnerable to <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">disaggregation attacks</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, where a malicious aggregator can take advantage of the multi-round nature of federated learning to construct a system of equations to ultimately solve for the model updates of a target party.
In summary, using existing crypto-based secure aggregation systems,
parties cannot be sure that all the received model updates have been aggregated as expected and are vulnerable to potential disaggregation leading to inference attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the previously described limitations, we propose <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span>, an efficient, scalable, and secure aggregation based privacy-preserving <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">f</span>ederated <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">l</span>earning <span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">de</span>centralized <span id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">trust</span> approach, that solves the dilemma of secure multi-party aggregation efficiency and centralized trust.
<span id="S1.p6.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> still follows the direction of advanced cryptography based approach to maximize simplicity and efficiency in terms of communication and computation, and is built on a recently proposed decentralized functional encryption (FE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> design in which each party generates the functional decryption key collaboratively.
The aggregator can only obtain the aggregated result from the received encrypted parties’ model updates using the functional decryption key.
As a result, <span id="S1.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> overcomes the limitation of previous state-of-the-art cryptography-based secure aggregation solutions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of SMC schemes is to protect the privacy of the inputs. In the FL setting, this means ensuring that nothing is revealed by the aggregation process other than the aggregated model.
Attacks that compromise the privacy of existing SMC schemes stem from the ability of the aggregator to <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i)</span> analyze the log of aggregated results or <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ii)</span> manipulate the data that is fed to the SMC procedure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A curious aggregator may launch a <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">disaggregation attack</span> by analyzing the outputs of the SMC over the training rounds. A matrix containing these outputs across training rounds and the knowledge of what parties participated in each round is used to build a system of equations that can be used to solve for the outputs of one of the parties. Note that this curious aggregator does not deviate from the training process and simply analyzes the matrix.
To prevent this attack, it is necessary to ensure that the resulting matrix does not enable the construction of equations that can be solved to isolate a single input.
Existing techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> only work for very large federations and are not appropriate for consortia with a small number of participants.</p>

Isolation attacks consist of selectively inputting model updates to the SMC process in such a way that certain model updates can be isolated. Isolation attacks violate privacy and may lead to biased models.
Techniques to prevent this attack have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> where an <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inference prevention module</span> is introduced to prevent potential malicious behaviors during the secure aggregation procedure; however, this module is deployed by a fully trusted authority which is difficult to embody in real-life scenarios.</p>

Both isolation and replay attacks are active attacks and are very difficult to detect. A potential solution is using specialize trusted hardware that is typically expensive and unavailable to federations.

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Preliminaries of Decentralized Functional Encryption:</span>
Functional encryption (FE) is a family of cryptosystems that allows the computation of functions over encrypted data and as a result the final function value is obtained in plaintext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FE schemes have shown promising efficiency improvements to address the secure multi-party aggregation challenge compared to existing homomorphic encryption-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, FL systems made use of a functional encryption scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that enabled the computation of inner product using a TPA.
Unlike the functional encryption scheme used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, this paper uses the recently proposed decentralized multi-client functional encryption (DMCFE) schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Threat Model and Assumptions</span>.
The objective of <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust</span> is to ensure that the FL training process can provide privacy of the <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">input</span>, which guarantees the privacy of each party’s local model, and the <span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">output</span>, which ensures the privacy of the aggregated global model.
The input privacy is achieved via secure aggregation, which allows the aggregator to learn only the aggregated model, and the output privacy is achieved through differential privacy.
We assume that a malicious aggregator may attempt to infer private information of a target party during or after the training process.
We focus our attention on disaggregation, isolation, and replay attacks described in Sec. <a href="#S2" title="2 Motivation and Preliminaries ‣ DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, and refer to the aggregator as <span id="S3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semi-trusted</span>.
Moreover, we assume that the aggregator may collude with <span id="S3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a subset of parties</span> of bounded size
to acquire private information of the other parties.
We assume that parties are honest-but-curious, and do not consider attacks where malicious parties manipulate the model updates to poison the ML model or reduce its accuracy or to create a denial of service attack.

Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, <span id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> adopts advanced cryptography-based secure aggregation to achieve privacy-preserving FL coupled with a consensus mechanism

</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Before training starts, <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> performs a decentralized consensus through its decentralized trust consensus (DTC) module.
The DTC module enables each party to inspect and negotiate the <span id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">participation matrix</span> that
dictates what parties model updates will be input into the SMC process and with what weights during each round of training. Initially, the aggregator proposes a participation matrix to determine which parties will be selected for each training round. Parties engage in a protocol that enables them to agree on a matrix that does not allow for inference.
At the end of DTC process, each party agrees on an updated participation matrix and uses it to generate the functional decryption key fragments, which represent its trust on the FL training process.
Training can only proceed after the successful completion of the DTC.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">At each training round, each party trains a local model, encrypts the model update using the DMCFE cryptosystem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and sends the encrypted model updates to the aggregator.
As part of the encryption, each party <span id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cryptographically labels</span> its model update with the current training round.
The aggregator then computes the new <span id="S3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global model</span> by aggregating all encrypted inputs.
The aggregator can execute secure aggregation by decrypting the set of encrypted model updates if and only if it receives all functional key fragments from parties for each training round.
In addition, for the decryption to be successful, the aggregator can use the cryptographic key only for the current round, as the encrypted model updates are labeled with that round.
Once the aggregator performs the decryption, it returns the new global model to each party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Importantly, while our <span id="S3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> solution utilizes the same functional encryption family as previous PPFL approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, it does not introduce any additional entities (e.g., the online trusted third-party authority suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>).
Thus, <span id="S3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> is architecturally equivalent to the standard FL paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, <span id="S3.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> supports both <span id="S3.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average</span> and <span id="S3.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">weighted</span> fusion methods directly, whereas the majority of secure aggregation approaches support just the former.

As a result, one limitation of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is that all parties needs to fully trust the third-party entity.

Our adoption does not change any algorithms of the DMCFE scheme.
According to formal security proof presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the encrypted model in <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> has ciphertext indistinguishability and is secure against adaptive corruptions under the classical DDH assumption.

We implement the underlying cryptosystem, i.e., the decentralized MCFE scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> in Python based on the <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gmpy2</span> library.
We also incorporate the techniques for final discrete logarithm computation as used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> in our implementation.
To integrate our proposed solution with the IBM-FL framework, we implement <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> privacy-preserving <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global fusion handler</span> and <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local training handler</span> classes for both aggregator and parties that respectively inherited the <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IterAvgFusionHandler</span> class and <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">LocalTrainingHandler</span> class of IBM-FL.

However, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HybridAlpha</span> relies on a centralized and trusted third-party authority to do so while <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> does not.

The underlying cryptosystem and reduced communication interactions contribute to this improvement in training time efficiency, as the <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span> utilizes decentralized multi-input client encryption with more efficient encryption and decryption algorithms, and only requires one round of interaction per secure aggregation.</p>

As shown in the first two figures of Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2.2 Performance of DeTrust-FL ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we report the model accuracy curve and training time for CIFAR10 dataset.

Theoretically, we believe that the slight improvement in accuracy is due to the encoding operation that converts the model weights between integers and floating-point numbers, which discards some information and could be considered as a type of pruning.
However, we left it as an open question to be investigated further in the future.</p>

In our experimental setting, each party’s training samples are assigned randomly; thus, the model accuracy improvement is not as significant as if they were more unbalanced, which often occurs in practice.
Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2.3 Impact of Numbers of Parties ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> also shows the training time results over 20 global training rounds.
The training time increases along the number of parties.
Each party in the IBM FL experiment is simulated by multiple processes in a parallel setting on a single node. Hence, the increased training time is caused by the increased computation time in the decryption phase and functional decryption key recovering phase at the aggregator, rather than the time spent at the parties.</p>

As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2.4 Impact of Encoding Precision on Floating-point Parameters ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the encoding precision setting has no significant influence on model accuracy.
Furthermore, a higher encoding precision setting may slightly increase the training time.
As mentioned above, since parties are simulated with multiple processes in this experiment there are some fluctuations in the growth curve.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising approach to collaboratively train a global model without sharing local data among participants and thereby providing a primary privacy guarantee.
The primary FL design is not sufficient for privacy-sensitive applications because it is still vulnerable from inference attacks on the final model and model updates between parties and aggregator, as demonstrated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
To partially address those threats, several privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy and secure multi-party computation have been adopted during the learning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Emerging hybrid privacy-preserving methodologies have shown promise to providing strong privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> employs the threshold Paillier cryptosystem to perform multi-party secure aggregation, while <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HybridAlpha</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> uses a functional encryption cryptosystem to securely aggregate encrypted local models.
Existing secure aggregation approaches mainly follow three directions: <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pairwise masking</span> based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <span id="S6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">homomorphic encryption</span> based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <span id="S6.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">functional encryption</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Pairwise masking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is a lightweight computation approach where each input is masked with one-time pads while the aggregated output cancels out those pads.
For example, Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> make use of double pairwise additive masking by integrating approaches such as secret sharing, key agreement, authenticated encryption, and public key infrastructure.
Even though those approaches are efficient in computation, they either require peer-to-peer communication or rely on a server forwarding the encrypted shares and masked inputs for each aggregation round, resulting in communication inefficiency.
Additionally, they are vulnerable to disaggregation attacks that are recently demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> in the context of multi-round secure aggregation in FL training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In homomorphic encryption-based approaches, one set of solutions such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> rely on additive homomorphic encryption schemes like the Paillier and its variants.
Another set of solutions such as PySyft <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> employs the SPDZ protocol that is built on somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) in the form of BGV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Those approaches are efficient in communication but are computationally inefficient.
Both pairwise masking and homomorphic encryption-based secure aggregation solutions only support average fusion algorithms and are not applicable to weighted fusion algorithms.
In addition, homomorphic encryption-based secure aggregation cannot guarantee secure aggregation to a party without special hardware.</p>

However, <span id="S6.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HybridAlpha</span> introduces and requires an online third-party entity that should be fully trusted by all parties, which makes impractical in some FL scenarios.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure aggregation, the underlying privacy-preserving computation primitive, plays an essential role during the privacy-preserving FL training.
Existing approaches do not address the dilemma of efficiency requirements and decentralized trust setting.
To address these limitations, in this paper
we propose <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DeTrust-FL</span>, a novel FL framework that does not require a fully trusted crypto dealer, as well as mitigating partial trust on the aggregator.
In addition, our experimental evaluation shows that our approach achieves comparable performance in terms of model accuracy and training time, and reduces the communication interactions by 16.4% compared to the state-of-the-art efficient approach without the prerequisite of a centralized trust setting.</p>
