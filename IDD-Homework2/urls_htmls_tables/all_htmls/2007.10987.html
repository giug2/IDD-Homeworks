<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an approach to conduct machine learning without centralizing training data in a single place, for reasons of privacy, confidentiality or data volume. However, solving federated machine learning problems raises issues above and beyond those of centralized machine learning. These issues include setting up communication infrastructure between parties, coordinating the learning process, integrating party results, understanding the characteristics of the training data sets of different participating parties, handling data heterogeneity, and operating with the absence of a verification data set.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p"><span id="id2.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> provides infrastructure and coordination for federated learning. Data scientists can design and run federated learning jobs based on existing, centralized machine learning models and can provide high-level instructions on how to run the federation. The framework applies to both Deep Neural Networks as well as “traditional” approaches for the most common machine learning libraries. <span id="id2.id2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> enables data scientists to expand their scope from centralized to federated machine learning, minimizing the learning curve at the outset while also providing the flexibility to deploy to different compute environments and design custom fusion algorithms.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an approach to apply machine learning to situations in which data cannot be centralized for a training process. The success of using machine learning to solve a problem depends, to a large extent, on the quality and quantity of available training data. Machine learning approaches typically rely on the central management of training data, even if the training process itself is run on a clustered infrastructure. The process can consider the properties of the total training data set and the availability of representative validation data sets, e.g., for hyperparameter tuning.
However, centralizing data for training is often not feasible or practical, for reasons of data privacy, secrecy, regulatory compliance, and the sheer volume of data involved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Enterprises have their applications deployed in a variety of data centers and clouds. In such a multi-cloud scenario, moving data into one location can be impractical or expensive, particularly if the data are generated at a high velocity or the amount of data is large. A similar situation holds in edge computing scenarios in which, say, data in telecommunication switches is used for training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, privacy regulations limit the use of personal data, make central data repositories expensive to manage, and represent a liability to the company storing the data. Regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and others require data holders to keep information private and limit how data can be used. Private and confidential data have been compromised from different systems in the past years, with notable security incidents including <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These data breaches result in costly mitigation, fines, and reputation damage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Many privacy regulations also contain limitations on the location where data can be stored. Often, they stipulate that data cannot be taken out of the country to which the regulation applies or at least not to countries that have weaker privacy protections. This even applies to data of the same company if it has, say, customer databases in different countries, and presents a serious obstacle to effective use of data in a training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, in some scenarios, different enterprises cooperate in training a machine learning model, mostly for non-competitive reasons. Financial institutions collaborate to combat money laundering and fraud - as required by regulation - and medical research facilities work jointly on improving diagnostics and treatment design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. However, due to regulation and secrecy, financial firms will not share transaction data and medical institutions cannot share patient data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While practical and regulatory reasons limit the centralization of training data, using these different sources of data is still important in many cases to build models on large and representative training datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated learning</span> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> is an approach to train machine learning models that do not require sharing datasets with a central entity. In federated learning, a model is trained collaboratively among multiple parties, which keep their training dataset to themselves but participate in a shared federated learning process. The notion of parties might refer to entities as different as data centers of an enterprise in different countries, compute clusters in different clouds, cell phones, cars, or different companies and organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The learning process between parties most commonly uses a single <em id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregator</em>, while peer-to-peer or decentralized models have also been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. An aggregator would coordinate the overall process, communicate with the parties, and integrate the results of the training process. Most typically, in particular for neural networks, parties would run a local training process on their training data, share the weights of their model with the aggregator, which would then aggregate the weight vectors of all parties using a <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fusion algorithm</span>. Then, the merged model is sent back to all parties for the next <em id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">round</em> of training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Classical machine learning</span> models can also be adapted to a federated environment. We have to decide which parts of the <span id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning algorithm</span> would run locally in parties and which would run in an aggregator.
A federated decision tree algorithm might grow the tree in the aggregator, and query the parties for the count information based on the parties’ data sets. Based on these counts, it would compute the information gains for all possible splits and select the feature with the largest information gain to split and built the tree node, and then iterate the next round.
There are many choices on how to design federated machine learning algorithms, and this is still a very active field of research at the point of writing this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">FL stands in contrast to established distributed training systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>,
where all data is transmitted to a central data center and is subsequently distributed among cluster nodes to train in parallel. This clustered, non-federated approach benefits from understanding the characteristics of the entire training data set and the computational capabilities of the nodes in the cluster, as well as its ability to partition the dataset into convenient chunks among nodes in a cluster. These assumptions do not hold in a federated setting. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges of FL</span> arise from different perspectives including data heterogeneity,
robustness of the federation process,
selection of unbiased fusion operators, security and privacy inference prevention and operational and effective deployment in enterprise and multi-cloud settings, among others.
While FL does not require the centralized management of training data, thus enabling machine learning to scenarios in which that is not possible, it also poses some new challenges, such as <span id="S1.p11.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data set heterogeneity</span>. In this context, there is no common view of the stochastic properties of the overall training data set, which precludes machine learning dependent on them, established pre-processing methods, fine-tuning algorithms and evaluation of model performance. This includes differences in distribution of data among participants, different dataset sizes for each party, different attributes and general issues of heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> provides a good overview of some challenges of federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy demands might also add additional restrictions to a federated learning system. For example, while membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where an adversary may try to infer the training data used during the training process by querying the final model, are possible in both centralized and federated learning settings, additional measures need to be considered in federated learning cases.
Some federated learning scenarios require that different parties are not able to derive insights about each other’s training data based on messages exchanged during the training process (e.g., weights).
Additionally, in some other cases, not even the aggregator may be trusted to see this information. Methods of creating differentially private noise or secure multi-party computation are used to meet these privacy requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This is mostly the case when data is owned by different enterprises or individuals, an example being data on phones. Multi-cloud settings may have a lesser need for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p">Another set of challenges relates to needs of the enterprise. (1) FL requires different <span id="S1.p13.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">skills</span> from machine learning to distributed systems to cryptography. It’s rare to find employees who have all these skills sets. An FL platform must provide a seamless on-ramp for its primary user base, the machine learning professional. (2) An FL platform must deal with <span id="S1.p13.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">operational complexity</span>. An FL process requires a more complex infrastructure and processes to enroll parties, distribute models, set up an aggregator, deploy a federated learning algorithm, conduct the federated learning process, and then make a final model available. The system must be resilient to parties with different characteristics and parties dropping out of the training process. (3) <span id="S1.p13.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Security and networking</span> are important to a federated learning solution. Given that FL is typically used where domain boundaries have to be dealt with, networking must suit the deployment needs and facilitate the required security. However, the setup of secure communication should not be burdensome to deploy, avoiding time-consuming processes such as opening ports as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p14.1" class="ltx_p">A few approaches and libraries for FL address some of these issues, including <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
However, <span id="S1.p14.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> focuses on enterprise settings where
secure deployment, failure tolerance,
and fast model specification are paramount; these must use existing machine learning libraries that allow enterprise users to take advantage of
a comprehensive set of state-of-the art algorithms without needing to learn new languages. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p15" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p15.1" class="ltx_p">We propose the <span id="S1.p15.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">IBM Federated Learning framework</span> to address these challenges and facilitate an easy integration of FL into productive machine learning workflows in the enterprise. Data scientists and machine learning professionals can benefit from a seamless transition from existing practices of model development to writing federated machine learning models. FL infrastructure must be easy to deploy by an enterprise and fit into the typical operations patterns of IT infrastructure. Finally, researchers in federated learning, those interested in designing novel federated learning algorithms and protocols, can try out their ideas with ease and build on the existing functionality for the specific needs of their organization or the particular application domain. The goal of IBM Federated Learning is to address all of these needs in an easy-to-use framework.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This white paper introduces <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span>, a Python framework for federated learning in the enterprise. This framework is a platform for executing federated learning algorithms by providing all of the basic elements of a federated learning infrastructure in an easily configurable way. On the one hand, it provides hooks to implement the party and aggregator parts of a federated learning algorithm. On the other hand, it is configurable to a variety of deployment scenarios, from mobile and edge scenarios, to multi-Cloud environments in an enterprise, to use cases across organizational boundaries. <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> is independent of a particular machine learning library or machine learning paradigm. It can be used for deep neural networks as well as “traditional” approaches such as decision trees or support vector machines. The abstractions for different model types provide a high level of reuse of federated learning algorithms for different machine learning libraries. A fusion algorithm for a deep neural network in Keras works as well with a native PyTorch one. Data access can be defined for each party independently. This is particularly important in the enterprise space where data stored in different data centers, Clouds or application silos can be brought together for a common learning task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The key design point of <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> is fast start-up time for enterprise applications. There is a large library of federated learning algorithms implemented on <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span> to get users started. Machine learning models tested successfully in a centralized learning application can often be extended to use data in different parties without rewriting the model code, but simply by editing configuration files. Party code is easy to deploy and, depending on the communication layer chosen, might not require opening ports on the party side, which makes deployment of a federated project faster and easier. Using <span id="S6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IBM Federated Learning</span>, enterprise practitioners can deploy federated learning quickly. In addition, researchers in the field can build on its existing platform to try out new federated learning algorithms and benchmark them against the existing ones in the library.</p>
