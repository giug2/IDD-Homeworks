<p id="id2.1" class="ltx_p">When the federated learning is adopted among competitive agents with siloed datasets, agents are self-interested and participate only if they are fairly rewarded.
To encourage the application of federated learning, this paper employs a management strategy, i.e., more contributions should lead to more rewards.
We propose a novel hierarchically fair federated learning (HFFL) framework.
Under this framework, agents are rewarded in proportion to their pre-negotiated contribution levels.
HFFL<math id="id2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="+" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id2.1.m1.1.1" xref="id2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.1.m1.1b"><plus id="id2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.1.m1.1.1"></plus></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.1.m1.1c">+</annotation></semantics></math> extends this to incorporate heterogeneous models.
Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on several datasets confirm the efficacy of our frameworks in upholding fairness and thus facilitating federated learning in the competitive settings.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, a recent distributed and decentralized machine learning scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahanMRHA17_aistat_fed_learning </a></cite> has attracted significant attention. In federated learning, agents maintain their data locally and collaboratively learn a global machine learning model that benefits all. Specifically, each agent sends parameters (or parameters update) of local models to the central server and receives the computed parameters of the global model from the central server. In this way, all agents can jointly train a global model without exposing their own data. This scheme has desirable properties such as privacy-preservation, efficient communication, and decentralized data storage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning could benefits all participating agents. As we can see in the left panel of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, at the end of communication round 0, each agent learns a model locally. Without federated learning, each agent can only learn from their local data. A model trained on local data only has poor generalization capability. Moreover, the performance of different agents’ models has a large variance. This is because without federated learning, each agent has an incomplete and biased view of the global data distribution.
At the end of every communication round 1 through 9, all agents send their model parameter updates to the central server and then receive the global model’s parameters from the central server. The global model parameters are used to improve their own model locally. With federated learning, each agent gets significant (indirect) exposure to the global data distribution and as a result, the median test accuracy among agents increases from <math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="45\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">45</mn><mo id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">45</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">45\%</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="95\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">95</mn><mo id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">95</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1c">95\%</annotation></semantics></math>. Moreover, each agent model’s bias with respect to the global data distribution also substantially reduces.
The right panel of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates the importance of the agents’ participation. As more agents contribute their data and federally learn a global model, the overall performance of the global model improves. To conclude, federated learning benefits agents by improving agents’ models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The tacit assumption of federated learning is that all agents are willing to participate in the federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">McMahanMRHA17_aistat_fed_learning </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-mohri19a </a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li_fair_2019 </a></cite>. However, in real-world situations, this assumption may not necessarily hold. Agents with siloed datasets are typically under competition and self-interested so that the agents are reluctant to collaborate unless they get some reward which is fair <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">kairouz2019advances </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kim_Blockchained_2019 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kang_2019_incentive </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Tran_federated_2019 </a></cite>. This necessitates the notion of fairness in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Previous research on fairness in federated learning typically aims to optimize model performance across all agents, either maximizing the performance of the worst agent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-mohri19a </a></cite> or uniforming the accuracy distribution over all agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li_fair_2019 </a></cite>. However, both these approaches do not take into account the extent of an agent’s contribution in the federated learning. More specifically, they tend to protect the weak agents (e.g., agents with small amounts of data) while neglecting the strong agents (e.g., agents with large amounts of data). As a result, the strong agents find it unfair on ignorance of their greater contribution. Consequently, strong agents may abort from the federated network sacrificing the small benefit or may choose to cooperate among themselves, excluding the weak ones. In order to obtain the full benefits of federated learning (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), we need a fairness mechanism that is acceptable to all agents, weak or strong.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we employ the management of reward schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">bratton2017human </a>; <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">herzberg1968one </a></cite> in federated learning in the sense that the agent who <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">contributes more</span> to the federated learning should be <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">rewarded more</span>. This fairness notion is applicable in many real-world situations. An illustrative example is that a company with a large amount of data would like not to cooperate with one that has a small amount of data if both receive the same reward (e.g., learn the same machine learning model).
It usually exerts a lot of effort and resources to collect data, which is valuable. Thus, equal reward in this case is unfair. In order to facilitate federated learning among two companies, they should be rewarded differently based on their relative contribution of data.
This fairness notion based on proportionality also finds support from social psychology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Tornblom_1985_fairness </a></cite>, which advocates that an individual’s outcomes (rewards) should match (be proportional to) his/her inputs (contributions). Similar ideas are also explored in game theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Rabin_1993_fairness </a></cite> and bandwidth allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li_bandwidth_2008 </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To apply this fairness notion to federated learning, two issues have to be addressed, i.e., <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(a)</span> how to determine the extent of an agent’s contribution to federated learning and <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(b)</span> what is the proportionate reward that the agents should receive in order to achieve the fairness.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">For the question <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(a)</span>, data Shapley can perhaps be used to determine the extent of an agent’s contribution since it is used to quantify data valuation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-ghorbani19c </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang_contributions_2019 </a></cite>. Specifically, the Shapley value of a datum computes the average of the marginal performance of this datum with any subsets of remaining data. The agent’s contribution can then be measured by summing up the Shapley value of all data of that agent. For a pre-specified learning task, the Shapley value of an agent can be different for different chosen models – it is model-dependent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-ghorbani19c </a></cite>. Thus, data Shapley is not a consistent metric to agent’s contribution for a pre-specified federated learning task. The self-interested agents may quit the collaboration due to perceived unfair treatment if the reward allocation is based on Shapley value. We elaborate this in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Identifying Contribution of Agents ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">

As long as agents should reach a consensus on the chosen publicly verifiable factors, they have to agree to be contractually bound <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">Holmstrom_1991 </a></cite> and commerce the federated learning.

To achieve this, we first classify all agents into different levels based on their publicly verifiable factors. Agents at the same level are deemed to have the same contribution and will be rewarded equally. Let us assume that low level agents contribute less and high level agents contribute more.
Then we train multiple models at every level such that the high-level agents only contribute the roughly same amount of data as the low-level agents own when the low-level model is federally learned. On the other hand, high-level agents get access to the low-level models to federally learn their high-level models. Our theoretical analysis shows that a model with more training data can potentially have less generalization error. In such a federated learning framework, the agents at the same contribution level share the same model and the agents at a higher contribution level can share a better model, which aligns with the proportional fairness notion.</p>

Fairness has also been considered in resource division in multi-agent systems. In this context, the resource provided by the environment needs to fairly shared by all agents. Some typical work includes the maximin sharing policy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">NIPS2014_5588 </a></cite>, which improves the performance of the worst agent, and the fair-efficient policy which makes the variation of agents’ utilities as small as possible  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jiang_fairnessMA_2019 </a></cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, existing work on fairness aims to ensure accuracy across all agents. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-mohri19a </a></cite> proposed agnostic federated learning (AFL), which minimizes the maximal loss function of all agents with a consideration on the overall performance. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li_fair_2019 </a></cite> proposed q-Fair Federated Learning (q-FFL) to encourage a more uniform accuracy distribution across all agents, where <math id="S2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑞</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1c">q</annotation></semantics></math> is a trade-off parameter between fairness and accuracy. They do not take the contribution of agents into consideration. Our notion of fairness is not to optimize the accuracy across all agents, but is to ensure that the agents which contribute more receive proportionately more reward. 
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Incentive design in federated learning</span>. Our employed fairness is also a kind of an incentive to encourage participation of agents based on their resources. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Richardson_2019_arxiv </a></cite> used a similar incentive where the central server pays agents proportional to their data valuation. They employed influence functions for data valuation. Influence functions quantify how much the model’s predictions would change if that datum was not used in the training process and is in fact the leave-out-one (LOO) method. The LOO method assigns zero value to the duplicate of a datum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">pmlr-v97-ghorbani19c </a></cite>. If two agents happened to have exactly the same data, then the extra data is deemed to be of zero value.
Furthermore, the LOO method is also model-dependent, which has the same issue of data Shapley.
In contrast, our work uses publicly verifiable factors of agents to identify agents’ contributions, which are free from model dependency.

Our theoretical analysis in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Theoretical Analysis ‣ 4 Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a> shows that a model learned with more data has higher confidence to generalize better.
Therefore, the agents at a higher contribution level have a better machine learning model. We assume that a better model implies a higher reward.
The implementation details are in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4.1 HFFL Algorithm ‣ 4 Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning ‣ Hierarchically Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Agents in lower levels having less data probably prefer simpler machine learning models, while agents having more data probably prefer more complex models. To facilitate this, we design an improved version of HFFL, namely, HFFL<math id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="+" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1b"><plus id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1"></plus></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1c">+</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework, HFFL, to achieve fairness among self-interested agents by rewarding agents hierachical model updates based on their contribution levels, thereby facilitating federated learning.
We first identify agents’ contributions based on publicly verifiable factors such as data quality, data volume, etc. Then, we develop the hierarchical federated learning framework, HFFL, that upholds the fairness notion. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of our proposed methods.
Future potential research includes (a) how to handle dishonest or heterogeneous agents in HFFL, (b) how to make HFFL<math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="+" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><plus id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"></plus></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">+</annotation></semantics></math> computationally efficient, e.g., by leveraging transfer learning, (c) comprehensively quantify all publicly verifiable data factors, and (d) introduce differential privacy into HFFL to thwart inference attacks on models.
