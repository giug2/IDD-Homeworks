<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">Distributed fuzzy neural networks (DFNNs) have attracted increasing attention recently due to their learning abilities in handling data uncertainties in distributed scenarios. However, it is challenging for DFNNs to handle cases in which the local data are non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we propose a federated fuzzy neural network (FedFNN) with evolutionary rule learning (ERL) to cope with non-IID issues as well as data uncertainties. The FedFNN maintains a global set of rules in a server and a personalized subset of these rules for each local client. ERL is inspired by the theory of biological evolution; it encourages rule variations while activating superior rules and deactivating inferior rules for local clients with non-IID data. Specifically, ERL consists of two stages in an iterative procedure: a rule cooperation stage that updates global rules by aggregating local rules based on their activation statuses and a rule evolution stage that evolves the global rules and updates the activation statuses of the local rules. This procedure improves both the generalization and personalization of the FedFNN for dealing with non-IID issues and data uncertainties. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the FedFNN over state-of-the-art methods.

However, due to increasing data privacy concerns, the samples collected from distributed parties must be processed locally. Distributed FNNs (DFNNs)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> address this issue by learning a global FNN via the integration of local models. However, the existing DFNNs are fragile to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In addition, as DFNNs tend to learn a shared group of global rules for all clients, their personalization ability is limited and their learned global rules are less adaptive. Furthermore, they regard the local model integration process as a convex optimization problem and solve it with the alternating direction method of multipliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which overlooks the powerful learning ability of feedforward FNNs.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, federated learning (FL) models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> offer decentralized learning architectures that allow local models to optimize their parameters using gradient descent. The FL approach learns a shared model by aggregating the updates obtained from local clients without accessing their data. Notably, data distribution heterogeneity
is also one of the key challenges for FL. Yet, many efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> have been made to handle this issue in FL, in which many approaches consider solutions that allow clients to have personalized models. However, few of the existing FL methods are able to simultaneously cope with data uncertainties and non-IID issues in distributed learning scenarios. Although several studies have adopted Bayesian treatments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Gaussian processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to enable FL methods to handle data uncertainties, their performance heavily relies on the learning of good posterior inferences and kernel functions, which is very time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a federated fuzzy neural network (FedFNN) with evolutionary rule learning (ERL) to handle data uncertainties and non-IID issues. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a), the theory of biological evolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> states that variants of the same species can evolve to adapt to their different living environments by selectively activating and expressing their genes. Inspired by this, we use FNNs as our local models and consider them as compositions of fuzzy rules, which capture valuable local data information from multiple views, such as distributions. Similar to the genes of a species, each rule of the FedFNN is a basic functional component that can be activated or deactivated for clients according to their performance on local data. Thus, our FedFNN aims to obtain a group of global fuzzy rules that can be selectively activated for local clients to enable them to outperform competing approaches on non-IID data.
It is worth noting that our ERL is a novel algorithm different from genetic algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. These two algorithms are inspired by the same theory but designed in different ways. The genetic algorithm treats the whole population as the evolution subject. It keeps selecting the fittest individuals in each generation to form more competitive populations until the performance gets stable. However, it needs to be re-adjusted whenever the environment is modified. Instead, the ERL considers the internal diversity of species, which means that a species normally includes several types of populations (subspecies) living in diverse environments. It regards subspecies as its evolution subjects and selectively optimises and shares gene groups among subspecies until they perform well in different environments. In our FedFNN, each agent that handles non-IID data corresponds to a sub-species. The ERL enables agents to cooperate with each other during their evolutions but preserve their personalities to adapt to diverse environments.
In general, our FedFNN aims at learning 1) a group of global rules that capture valuable information among local clients and 2) a rule activation strategy for each local client to ensure the personalization and superior performance of the FedFNN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The ERL is an iterative learning approach with two stages: a rule cooperation stage, where the global rules are updated cooperatively by clients based on their rule activation statuses, and a rule evolution stage, where the activation statuses of local rules are adjusted according to their contributions to the performance of the FedFNN on non-IID local data. The former stage enhances the cooperation among clients for learning more representative global rules, which increases the generalizability of the FedFNN. In contrast, the latter stage fulfils the selective activation of rules that enable the local FNNs to be more adaptive and perform better on non-IID data, which improves the personalization of the FedFNN.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DFNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have been proposed to handle the uncertainties encountered in distributed applications. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a DFNN model that randomly sets the parameters in antecedents and only updates the parameters in consequent layers. Later, they extended this work to an online DFNN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Their models assume that all clients share the information in antecedent layers, making this technically not a seriously distributed method. To avoid this problem, a fully DFNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> model was proposed by adopting consensus learning in both the antecedent and consequent layers. As its subsequence variant, a semisupervised DFNN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> was presented to enable the DFNN to leverage unlabeled samples by using the fuzzy C-means method and distributed interpolation-based consistency regularization. However, the existing DFNNs cannot handle situations in which the data distribution varies across clients. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a DFNN with hierarchical structures to process the heterogeneity existing in the variables of training samples. However, instead of processing the data heterogeneity across distributed clients, they focused on variable composition heterogeneity, which meant that data variables were collected from different sources.
Generally, by employing the well-known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy if-then rules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the existing DFNN models build the antecedent layers of their local models in traditional ways (e.g., K-means) and calculate the corresponding consequent layers with closed-form solutions. Then, the original DFNNs are transformed into convex optimization problems. While efficient and effective, they are not able to learn local models with personalized rule sets. Worse, they fail to utilize the strong learning abilities of neural networks that enable local FNNs to investigate more adaptive rules.</p>

Numerous FL algorithms have been presented to solve the non-IID problem, e.g., stochastic controlled averaging for FL (SCAFFOLD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>; FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>; model-contrasted FL (MOON) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which attempts to increase the effect of local training on heterogeneous data by minimizing the dissimilarity between the global model and local models; FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which improve the aggregation stage by utilizing Bayesian nonparametric methods and local update normalization, respectively; CCVR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which calibrates the constitutive classifiers using virtual representations to eliminate the global model bias caused by local distribution variance; and FedEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which introduces expectation maximization to make the learned model robust to data heterogeneity. Though these methods have been proposed based on FedAvg by trying to learn a more robust global model, they focus on learning a shared global model, which degrades their performance when the data distributions heavily vary across clients.</p>

As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III Federated Fuzzy Neural Network ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the FedFNN includes one server and several local clients. The server is responsible for communication with local clients and maintaining a group of global rules by aggregating the uploaded local rules. Local clients download the global rules as local rules for constructing their FNNs, which are then updated via training on their own data. Due to the concerns of data privacy, each local agent learns from its own data without accessing the data of other agents and communicates, while the server communicates with all local agents and aggregates the locally learned rules according to their activation status.
An overview of a local FNN is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III Federated Fuzzy Neural Network ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this stage, we focus on the learning of more general global rules. Generally, the global rules activated by multiple clients are able to capture informative representations across these clients. Thus, updating the general global rules requires cooperation among the local clients.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Technically, the rule cooperation stage highly relies on the rule activation status vectors of the local clients. These vectors are randomly initialized at the beginning and updated in the rule evolution stage. During each communication round, the local clients download the global rules from the server as their local rules. Then, the global server selects the activated rules according to the corresponding rule activation status vectors to build the local FNNs.
As described in the Local Training of the algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV Evolutionary Rule Learning ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the constructed personalized local FNNs are then trained on their associated non-IID local data to update the activated local rules.</p>

This is different from existing FL methods that aggregate local models without checking whether their updates are helpful or not. Our ERL approach only shares the useful pieces of information that contribute to each other while avoiding misleading information. This procedure enables the FedFNN to be more general.</p>

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that for the fairness of the experiments, the features in all datasets are first normalized between -1 and 1 using the well-known mapminmax normalization method. Then, a certain proportion of the features is randomly polluted by noise generated from a normal Gaussian distribution to simulate uncertainty in the different datasets. This perturbed sample proportion is considered the uncertainty level and is used to verify the uncertainty processing abilities of the comparison algorithms. In this section, all experiments are conducted with 5-fold cross-validation, and each experiment is repeated 10 times. The final reported results are the mean average precision (mAP) values obtained on the test data during these runs.</p>

Instead, our personalized local FNN for the 5-th client achieves relatively high performance on all clients by automatically generating new rules to estimate the unique samples in the 6-th category. The newly generated rules are unique to this client and cannot be disturbed by other clients; thus, our proposed personalized local FNN exhibits superiority in dealing with heterogeneous local clients based on its flexible structure.</p>

In addition, we list the performance attained by all algorithms when processing datasets with 10% uncertainty in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. From the table, our model outperforms the DFNN* in terms of test accuracy by an average of 36.40%. Thus, the extraordinary ability of our FedFNN to deal with data uncertainties can be confirmed.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To verify the convergence ability of our proposed FedFNN, the test accuracies it achieves throughout the optimization process are depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. As the results in this figure show, the FedFNN gradually converges with the increase in the number of communication rounds on all datasets.
In addition, the functions and contributions of the rule cooperation stage and the rule evolution stage are clearly proven in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.

However, the performance of the local FNNs gradually falls into a bottleneck along with the execution of the rule cooperation stage, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, where the test accuracy hardly increases at each ERL iteration. The subsequent rule evolution stage solves this issue by updating the local model architecture. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the performance of the local clients dramatically increases because of the mutation of local rules.
Eventually, these rapid performance improvements induced by the latter learning stage vanish after each local client learns all their required activated local rules.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a FedFNN with ERL to handle non-IID issues and data uncertainties in distributed scenarios. The proposed FedFNN integrates fuzzy if-then rules into an FL framework. By considering these fuzzy rules as the basic optimization units, our FedFNN is able to learn a group of general global rules and selectively activate an effective subset of these rules for each local client. This flexible composition approach for fuzzy rules increases the personalization of the local models with respect to handling non-IID data. Inspired by the theory of biological evolution, the proposed ERL method not only encourages the cooperation of local clients at the rule level to improve the generalization of the global rules but also updates the rule activation statuses for all clients to make their local models more personalized. Unlike most existing FL methods that implement aggregation among all local models, the FedFNN with ERL only aggregates the activated rules for their corresponding local clients. This enables the server to selectively aggregate only beneficial local updates, preventing the disturbances brought by harmful updates. Consequently, the FedFNN with ERL provides an effective learning framework for dealing with non-IID issues as well as data uncertainties. Comprehensive experiments verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed FedFNN over state-of-the-art methods. In the future, we will improve the ERL to increase the robustness and communication efficiency of FedFNN in scenarios where the agent number is large. In addition, we will investigate the applications in interpretable AI using our FedFNN.</p>
