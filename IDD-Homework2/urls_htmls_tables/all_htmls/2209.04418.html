<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">The safety-critical scenarios of artificial intelligence (AI), such as autonomous driving, Internet of Things, smart healthcare, etc., have raised critical requirements of trustworthy AI to guarantee the privacy and security with reliable decisions. As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this paper, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can resist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training latency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by deep reinforcement learning based algorithm compared with baseline algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has yielded a bloom of worldwide developments and profoundly changed human life, such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, etc. However, recent research results have found that AI may cause potential vulnerabilities by, for example, leaking privacy data or making unreliable decisions under adversarial attacks (e.g., misdiagnosed disease in smart healthcare). Consequently, a new AI paradigm is emerging, named <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trustworthy AI</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which aims at avoiding unfavorable impacts from AI and has garnered increased interest in both academia and industry. In particular, the trustworthy AI intends to achieve stable and sustained high learning accuracy under the considerations of robustness, privacy, accountability, fairness, interpretability, and environmental well-being <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
As a promising framework of trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to guarantee data privacy in the AI model training process, which collaboratively trains a global AI model by coordinating multiple devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In the server-client architecture of FL, each device executes local training and uploads its updated local model to a server without transmitting the private raw data. The server then aggregates the collected local models for global AI model update, followed by disseminating the updated global model to devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, FL provides a privacy protection solution for privacy-sensitive intelligent applications, e.g., smart healthcare, financial industry, and IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, security challenges still exist in FL due to the potential malicious devices and malicious server, which will degrade the performance of AI model training or destroy the FL training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Although FL guarantees the privacy protection of edge devices, the global model can be attacked by malicious edge devices (e.g., model poisoning or adversarial attacks) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Various secure model aggregation algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge, e.g., geometric median, trimmed mean, and multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
In particular, the server-client architecture is vulnerable to server’s malfunction, which includes a potential single point of failure or tamper of global model. The failure or tamper in the server will collapse the entire FL training. To address this issue, blockchain was adopted to establish a decentralized blockchain-based FL (B-FL) network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which leverages multiple servers to execute global model aggregation and confirm the correctness of global model using consensus protocols (e.g., Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Raft, and practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT)) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The B-FL can thus resist failures or attacks of servers and devices by building trustworthy global model aggregation with secure model aggregation based on blockchain consensus protocol among multiple servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the latency of FL training process, one of key metrics in the edge AI, is also crucial to improve the communication efficiency of FL due to the fading nature of wireless channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
To implement the FL over wireless networks, the edge devices transmit their local models and the edge server disseminates the shared global model over wireless links. This typically consists of computation latency and communication latency, for which theoretical analysis and resource allocation for FL latency have recently been provided <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Specifically, Li <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> characterized the delay distribution for FL over arbitrary fading channels via the saddle point approximation method and large deviation theory. Chen <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed a probabilistic device scheduling policy to minimize the overall training time for wireless FL. Ren <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> formulated a training acceleration optimization problem developed the close-form expressions for joint batch size selection and communication resource allocation. Yang <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> considered a delay minimization problem to obtain the optimal solution by a bisection search algorithm.
However, the latency in wireless B-FL becomes much more complicated due to the additional multiple rounds of cross-validation among edge servers in blockchain consensus protocol. The computation latency includes the local training, global model aggregation and block validation, which depends on the computation capability of edge devices and servers, and the size of dataset and models. The communication latency includes the uplink and downlink transmissions for model updates and blockchain consensus protocol, which mainly depend on wireless communication techniques, bandwidth, and power budgets. It is thus critical to characterize the latency of the wireless B-FL system and optimize the network resources to reduce the overall learning latency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on designing a B-FL architecture to support trustworthy and low latency AI service under the consensus protocol of blockchain. Specifically, we utilize the PBFT consensus protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to achieve high effectiveness and low energy consumption compared with the existing consensus protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW), and Raft with some loss of security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The training latency in B-FL system is characterized by considering the computation latency and communication latency, which consists of local training, global model aggregation, consensus protocol, and model dissemination. We then propose to minimize the long-term average learning latency by allocating bandwidth and power resources. This long-term resource allocation problem cannot be equivalently transformed to multiple one-shot problems with respect to the channel of each round, due to the correlation in the long-term average power constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Besides, as the optimization variables are coupled in the objective function and constraints, the conventional optimization-based algorithms have prohibitive computational complexity and may be inapplicable in the time-sensitive B-FL system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
To address the challenges, we propose to transform the long-term resource allocation problem to a Markov decision process (MDP), for which a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is developed to achieve efficient and adaptive resource allocation with low computational complexity from a long-term perspective. The developed DRL-based algorithm will minimize the cumulative latency from a long-term perspective, which balances the latency in current round and that in the future rounds by dynamic resource allocation. Moreover, the DRL-based algorithm establishes a direct mapping from the current network information to resource allocation by deep neural network (DNN), which can significantly reduce the computational complexity.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The blockchain-based FL system has recently received significant interests in designing trustworthy AI by leveraging the consensus protocol of blockchain and a recent survey paper has presented the fundamental concepts and opportunities in the integration of FL and blockchain, which is called FLchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In particular,
Qu <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and Ma <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed a B-FL architecture based on PoW consensus protocol, which uses the miners in the blockchain as the centralized aggregator to replace the single dedicated server in the traditional FL system.
Besides,
Li <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-based federated learning framework with an innovative committee consensus mechanism to avoid malicious central servers and realize effective decentralized storage.
The Biscotti in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> designed a proof-of-federation (PoF) consensus protocol, which coordinates FL training between devices to generate blockchain by providing beneficial model updates or by facilitating the consensus process.

Based on the above architectures of B-FL with different consensus protocols, there are several works optimizing the network efficiency, e.g., latency and energy consumption.
Kim <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, Li <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and Pokhrel <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> analyzed an end-to-end latency model of B-FL based on PoW, characterized the close-form of optimal block generation rate in different scenarios, and formulated an edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation, respectively.
The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> considered blockchain-enabled FL with PoW consensus protocol and achieved a certain model accuracy while minimizing the energy consumption and training latency with a reasonable payment by DRL approach. Nguyen <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> employed a decentralized FL model aggregation algorithm in a peer-to-peer-based blockchain network and formulated a system latency minimization problem by optimizing communication and computation resources.

Moreover, several works are already deployed in the real blockchain platforms. For example, Zhang <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> tackled the challenge of data heterogeneity in failure detection of industrial IoT and implement the B-FL system in Ethereum to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and performance. Kang <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> presented efficient reputation management for mobile devices based on consortium blockchain and establish the reputation blockchain system on the Corda.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional server-client architecture for wireless FL consists of single edge server and multiple edge devices, which collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing private data of edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.
However, the server-client architecture is vulnerable to edge server’s malfunction, which includes a potential single point of failure and malicious global model poison <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. A failure in the edge server may collapse the entire FL network.
In this paper, the proposed wireless B-FL combines the wireless FL with permissioned blockchain to execute global model aggregation based on blockchain consensus protocol among multiple edge servers, which can resist failures or attacks of edge servers for trustworthy global model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The permissioned blockchain provides an attractive solution for malicious server attacks in conventional single server wireless FL due to its features such as decentralization, immutability, and traceability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
In particular, the wireless B-FL system consists of multiple edge servers and multiple edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, which generates a blockchain in a form of blocks linked by cryptography under the control of a consensus protocol to confirm that the data in the block is correct and immutable.
The block is a data structure consisting of all information of local models and global model.
Therefore, the decentralized blockchain technology is adopted to provide a trustworthy model aggregation platform powered by distributed consensus protocol, which mitigates the single point of failure and malicious poison of edge server and ensures transparency and immutable.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, the B-FL system comprises one primary edge server and several validator edge servers to produce a new block and reach a consensus. In each training round, each edge device trains the local model based on its own dataset followed by uploading the local model to the primary edge server. The primary edge server validates the identities of local models and aggregates them to the global model by executing the smart contract. The smart contract consists of lines of code, which is immutable and trackable to execute a function, e.g, secure global model aggregation. Then, the local models and global model are packed into a new block, which is broadcasted among validator edge servers to validate the correctness of global model. <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> For example, the validator edge servers recalculate the global model and compare it with the global model from the primary edge server. The validator edge servers will reach a consensus on the correctness of global using consensus protocols (e.g., PoW, PBFT). B-FL will enter the next training round if the global model is correct. However, if the primary edge server computes incorrectly or tampers with the global model, the validator edge servers will ignore the global model from the malicious primary edge server and choose another primary edge server to restart the training round.</span> After the validator edge servers reaching a consensus, the new block is stored in the blockchain to ensures transparency and traceability. The validated global model is then disseminated to edge devices. Therefore, the consensus protocol is the critical factor to ensure the uniformity and security of the decentralized blockchain system.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we adopt the PBFT consensus protocol in the proposed B-FL system to realize secure global model aggregation among edge servers.
Compared with famous and widely-used PoW consensus protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, PBFT has weaker security performance. Generally, PoW is a permissionless consensus protocol, which means arbitrary edge sever can participate in the consensus and can tolerate 50% computing power attack. PBFT is a permissioned consensus protocol, which means only the authorized edge sever can participate in the consensus and can just resist 33% malicious edge servers.
However, PBFT achieves more effective consensus and lower electrical energy consumption than PoW. In particular, the consensus rate of PBFT is hundreds of times higher than that of PoW and the PoW-based Bitcoin costs as much electrical energy as the whole of Switzerland <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To achieve high effectiveness and low energy consumption, we choose the PBFT consensus protocol in our proposed B-FL system.</p>

The digital signature is a cryptology technique, which is used to validate the authenticity and integrity of data packets and guarantee that the information in data packet is not be tampered with others. The transaction is a concept in blockchain system involving cryptocurrency, contracts, records or other information to record all behavior in blockchain. In this paper, we assume that the data packets are encoded into digital signals (e.g. polar code) and transmitted by rate adaptation scheme to ensure error-free transmission. It is worth noting that the primary edge server is appointed before each training round (e.g., the primary edge server rotates among all the edge servers) and all edge devices and edge servers know the primary edge server before each round. In this step, the communication latency is the transaction uploading for all edge devices.</p>

The validator edge servers, which are all edge servers except for the primary edge server, receive the new block and verify the digital signature of transactions and new block to confirm the valid digital signature of new block. Furthermore, the global model is recalculated to confirm that the primary edge server computes correctly. After verification, each validator edge server stores the new block to local. In this step, the computation latency is the digital signature validation of new block and recalculation of global model.

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.5" class="ltx_p">In fact, the durations of time-slots are very short (e.g., the frame time-slot of LTE protocol is 10 ms), but the duration of one B-FL training round is often in the time-scale of second because of the high computation and communication complexity in model training and consensus protocol. Therefore, each B-FL training round contains multiple time-slots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Because the purpose of this paper is minimization total latency from the long-term perspective with enormous rounds, the channel dynamics of multiple time-slots in a single round is negligible. Thus, we employ the average channel gain instead of the instantaneous ones as the channel gain in one round to simplify the problem, i.e., <math id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.5" class="ltx_Math"

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After generating the new block, the primary edge server will broadcast a pre-prepare message to all the validator edge servers for validation. The pre-prepare message consists of the digital signature of the primary edge server and the information of the new block. The validator edge servers, which are all edge servers except the primary edge server, need to validate that the new block are generated by the given primary edge server and validate the identities of all transactions to ensure the new block is valid. Besides, the validator edge servers are mainly responsible for correctness validation of global model, which can use an intuitive method by repeatedly calculating the global model through identified local models, and comparing the computation results with the global model of primary edge server.</p>

Moreover, the optimization variables of the high-dimensional optimization problem are coupled in the objective function and constraints. As a result, the conventional optimization based algorithms suffer from high computational complexity, which is unacceptable in the time-sensitive B-FL system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, although the supervised learning, and unsupervised learning based resource allocation schemes can solve the one-shot optimization problem to provide significant reduction on computational complexity, the sub-optimal performance may occur in the long-term resource allocation problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a DRL-based algorithm to minimize the long-term cumulative latency by modeling problem (24) as analyze MDP. In particular, the DRL can optimize problem (24) from a long-term perspective by balancing the latency in current round and that in the future rounds while achieving significant reduction on computational complexity by establishing a direct mapping from the current network information to resource allocation decisions as DNN-based policy.
Besides, the network information (i.e., channel conditions, current latency) for the decision-making and policy update of DRL agents is obtained by interacting with the dynamic B-FL system, which enables the learned policy to keep track of the environment dynamic.
To this end, we shall formulate the MDP for problem (24), and then we shall develop a TD3 based algorithm to make decisions in continuous action spaces, which will be described in detail in the next section.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the definition of the MDP problem, the state space and action space are continuous, which indicates that infinite dimension of action can not be solved by Q-learning or deep Q network. Recently, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm has achieved considerable performance for solving MDP problem with continuous action variables. Moreover, the enhanced version of DDPG, i.e., twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, can reduce the overestimation bias of Q value and avoid sub-optimal policy updates,
which improves the policy learning speed and performance in continuous control domains.
The TD3 is widely used to solve complex resource allocation problem in real-time.
We thus propose a TD3 based resource allocation algorithm to solve the MDP problem of B-FL system in this paper.
The TD3 algorithm is presented in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ IV-A MDP Formulation ‣ IV TD3 based Resource Allocation Algorithm ‣ Trustworthy Federated Learning via Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> in details.</p>

Due to the complexity of the mapping function of actor and critic, and vector structure of state and action, the actor and critic are implemented by deep neural networks (DNN), which consist of several full-connected layers of neurons to construct the feature extractor and the output layer. Then, we introduce the training processes of actor-critic architecture and update rules of TD3 algorithm as follows.</p>

The target critic networks aim to generate target values, which approximates real Q values.
The target actor network is used to select actions.
In other words, the critic networks and actor network, a.k.a., online networks, are used to update the DNN parameters in each step, and the target networks are assumed as real Q value and optimal action. The DNN parameters of target networks are updated based on the online networks with delayed method, i.e., the target networks update after several steps of online networks.

The B-FL can still be applied when the edge servers or edge devices exit the system before the completion of FL, but suffer from system security and global model accuracy degradation.
The DRL-based resource allocation algorithm is compatible with the case of moving edge servers or edge devices. When the edge servers or edge devices exit the system, the relevant parameters in the states and actions are set to be null to cope with the smaller number of edge servers or edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, if the number of edge servers and edge devices increases, the DRL-based resource allocation algorithm needs to be retrained, because the output layer dimension of actor network increases.

We design the fully-connected neural network (FNN) model by two hidden layers with ReLU activation and one output layer with sigmoid activation. Each hidden layer is composed of 100 neurons. In the training process, we set that the batch size is 32, the local learning rate is 5e-6 and local training epoch is 1. Furthermore, we partition the 26 individuals as 20 training edge devices to train a shared global model and 6 test edge devices to evaluate the accuracy of global model.</p>

Firstly, one observation is that our proposed TD3-based algorithm has the similar result with the benchmark Monte Carlo algorithm, and is better than the random allocation and average allocation schemes.
<span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> In particular, the DRL-based algorithm is a little better than Monte Carlo algorithm, because the Monte Carlo method is computationally expensive and can only obtain a sub-optimal solution by using a finite number of samples.</span>
We take this result to present the performance of our TD3-based algorithm, which chooses more efficient and better resource allocation scheme. Secondly, the long-term latency can significantly decrease with increasing maximum system bandwidth. Similarly, we present the impact of maximum system transmit power in Fig. <a href="#S5.F14" title="Figure 14 ‣ V-C Convergence of TD3 Based Resource Allocation Algorithm ‣ V Numerical Results and Analysis ‣ Trustworthy Federated Learning via Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>.</p>

The number of edge devices varies from 10 to 60 and the other system settings are fixed. In the simulation, we find that TD3-based algorithm achieves greater gaps than three benchmarks with increasing number of edge devices. The long-term latency is increasing over more edge devices, which is because the average resources decrease and the size of new block increase.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a B-FL architecture to ensure the security and privacy, which utilizes secure global aggregation and blockchain technique to resist the attacks from malicious edge devices and servers. We utilized PBFT consensus protocol in B-FL to achieve high effectiveness and low energy consumption for trustworthy FL. The procedures of PBFT-based wireless B-FL was presented at first, and the training latency was then analyzed. We have formulated an optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth allocation and transmit power allocation to minimize the long-term average training latency. To solve this network optimization problem, we derived TD3-based algorithm to achieve long-term resource allocation and low computational complexity. Finally, we simulated the learning performance of wireless B-FL and efficiency of DRL based resource allocation algorithm, which is compared with baseline algorithms (i.e., random allocation, average allocation, and Monte Carlo algorithm). Our simulation results shown that the wireless B-FL architecture can resist the attacks from malicious servers and malicious devices. Furthermore, the training latency of wireless B-FL can be significantly reduced by the developed TD3-based adaptive resource allocation scheme.</p>
