<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">FEderated Edge Learning (FEEL) has emerged as a leading technique for privacy-preserving distributed training in wireless edge networks, where edge devices collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models with the orchestration of a server. However, due to frequent communication, FEEL needs to be adapted to the limited communication bandwidth. Furthermore, the statistical heterogeneity of local datasets’ distributions, and the uncertainty about the data quality pose important challenges to the training’s convergence. Therefore, a meticulous selection of the participating devices and an analogous bandwidth allocation are necessary. In this paper, we propose a data-quality based scheduling (DQS) algorithm for FEEL. DQS prioritizes reliable devices with rich and diverse datasets. In this paper, we define the different components of the learning algorithm and the data-quality evaluation. Then, we formulate the device selection and the bandwidth allocation problem. Finally, we present our DQS algorithm for FEEL, and we evaluate it in different data poisoning scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training centralized machine learning (ML) models requires the collection of large datasets from sparse and highly distributed sources. Nonetheless, in addition to the communication overheads, data collection raises an increasing concern about sharing private information. FEderated Edge Learning (FEEL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a ML setting that utilizes multi-access edge computing (MEC) to tackle these concerns. In contrast to centralized ML, FEEL consists of training the model on the user equipment (UE) under the orchestration of a MEC server, where only the resulting parameters are sent to the edge servers to be aggregated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The predominant FEEL system model is a synchronous time-division resource allocation system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This means that the MEC server waits for all UEs to send their updates before aggregating them. However, in reality, not all updates can be aggregated. In fact, updates from UEs who do not report before a fixed deadline are cancelled. A real deployment of FEEL is therefore subject to the following challenges:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limited Resources</span>: In a contrast to cloud servers, the computing and storage resources at the edge are rather limited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The gap in computational resources of the UEs causes significant delays due to stragglers. Furthermore, to run the iterative FEEL learning, the Base Station (BS) generally needs to connect a large number of UEs across a resource-limited spectrum and therefore can only support a limited number of UEs sending their model updates over unreliable channels for global aggregation. Additionally, the size of the updates can be very large in the case of deep neural networks. As a result, the communication overhead becomes a bottleneck for FEEL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Unbalanced and non-IID</span>: Unlike traditional ML systems, in which an algorithm operates on a large data set distributed homogeneously over several servers in the cloud, FEEL is typically trained on a large, often unbalanced, and non-identically distributed (non-IID) dataset that is generated by separate distributions across different UEs. A large number of UEs participate in the training, where several own small datasets, which makes local models prone to overfitting. Moreover, the dataset of a given UE is usually based on a particular user’s usage pattern, and thus a particular user’s local data set will likely be redundant and not representative of the remainder of the population distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Unreliable and malicious devices</span>: Although FEEL has improved privacy protection, it still suffers from several problems. First, all devices involved in the FEEL process are expected to contribute their resources unconditionally, which is not accepted by all UEs. Without reward, only a small fraction of the devices are willing to participate in the training process. On the other hand, the UEs involved in the training are unreliable and may act maliciously, intentionally, or unintentionally, which may affect the overall model and lead to erroneous model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing work on FEEL proposed scheduling algorithms aiming to optimize resource utilization. The considered resources are time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, transmission energy of participating UEs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and local computation energy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the number of scheduled UEs is often restricted in order to meet latency and energy constraints. However, optimization should consider learning related aspects, especially data distributions and quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, providing a reliable device selection is a necessary stepping stone for enabling efficient and useful updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The main motivation behind this paper is to design a scheduling algorithm for FEEL that considers UEs datasets’ different properties at its heart. In fact, while datasets are unbalanced and non-IID, but a UE with a large dataset is not necessarily in possession of useful data. Furthermore, malicious UEs can train the model on poisoned datasets, which requires additional mechanisms to reduce their damages to the training process.
In this paper, we consider diversity of the datasets and the reliability of the UEs as the baseline criterion for choosing participating devices in FEEL. The diversity evaluation allows to give priority to UEs with potentially more informative datasets to speed up the training process, and the reputation mechanism sanctions malicious UEs with poisoned datasets.
Accordingly, we propose a method for incorporating datasets’ properties in FEEL scheduling, by designing a novel data-quality value measure, and designing a data-quality based scheduling algorithm (DQS).</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, first we discuss the related work regarding device scheduling and data quality in FEEL. Next, we illustrate the existing research gaps and motivate the need for designing a data-quality based scheduling algorithm for FEEL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Among the first works to explore device selection is work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, where authors mitigated the straggler problem by giving priority to end devices with good communication and computation capabilities. However, this method is not suitable in FEEL context, where datasets’ distributions vary, as it discards UEs with larger and potentially more informative datasets. Several works proposed scheduling algorithms that aim to maximize the number of participating devices while optimizing used resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For instance, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm aiming to collect the maximum number of updates possible as a guarantee for the training speed. Another example is in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, where authors study different scheduling strategies based on the wireless channel’s state. Other works focus on the staleness of updates to calculate the priority <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, where higher priority is given to UEs that did not participate in previous rounds or have stale updates. Despite the variety of the scheduling algorithms in the literature, the design and evaluation of FEEL scheduling under heterogeneous and uncertain dataset distributions remains a topic that is not well addressed, as data-quality issues are overlooked and under-explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the reliability problem, several FL works use reputation systems for UEs selection, as UEs with high reputation are more likely to provide high quality data for the learning procedure. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a decentralized peer-to-peer approach to overcome the problem of unreliable UEs, where poisoning is prevented by verifying peer contributions to the model. However, due to stastical heterogeneity and high communication costs, P2P verification may not always be suitable. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors presented a blockchain-based reputation system for FL, where a UE’s reputation is traceable. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors presented a reputation-based UE selection using subjective logic. This solution evaluates the reputation of UEs based on their past interactions with other task publishers in the network. Nonetheless, such approach relies on the willingness of several other similar task publishers to share their opinions.
Based on our analysis of these works, we found that most of them did not consider the data heterogeneity when evaluating device reputation, and might not be suitable for realistic FEEL scenarios.
Consequently, we found it necessary to build a scheduling algorithm for FEEL that considers UEs datasets’ different properties (<math id="S2.p3.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i.e.," display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.1.m1.3a"><mrow id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1"><mrow id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0.167em" id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1a.cmml">.</mo><mi id="S2.p3.1.m1.2.2" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml">e</mi></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0.167em" id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.2">.</mo><mo id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.3">,</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.1.m1.3b"><apply id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1">formulae-sequence</csymbol><ci id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci><ci id="S2.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.2.2">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.1.m1.3c">i.e.,</annotation></semantics></math> limited bandwidth, unbalanced/ non-IID data) alongside UEs reliability.</p>

The disclosure of this data is not only harmful to the UE, but the intentional/unintentional alteration of the data can also cause security problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. One of the main types of attacks that can affect model severally is poisoning attack. A poisoning attack occurs when the attacker is capable of injecting false data or altering the training samples of the FEEL model’s learning pool, and thus causing it to learn on wrong or erroneous data. Poisoning attacks can occur during the training period and are primarily aimed at availability or integrity of the data. Generally, there are two main approaches to generate poisoned attacks, namely: label-flipping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and backdoor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we mainly focus on label-flipping where an adversary modifies a small number of examples/training data and maintains the characteristics of the data unchanged to degrade the performance of the model.</p>

Depending on the application, other quality measures can also be used. For instance, in image classification, measures regarding image quality (e.g., blur) can heavily affect the learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Such measures can be evaluated on a subset of images and normalized for a seamless integration in the index.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present our proposed solution for data-quality based scheduling to solve (8). As problem (8) can be transformed into a knapsack problem, we chose to follow a greedy knapsack algorithm to solve it. A greedy knapsack algorithm has low complexity and will allow fast and efficient scheduling under the rapidly changing wireless edge environment. In fact, while the ranked list solution of the knapsack approach might enhance scheduling performance in terms of overall data quality, it is not efficient in defining the optimal bandwidth allocation decision. Moreover, selecting the highest ranked UE with the best data-quality value without considering the extent of bandwidth required by each UE does not lead to an optimized performance benefit. Consequently, it is preferable to follow a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects a UE with better ratio <math id="S4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\frac{V_{k}}{\alpha_{k}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mfrac id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">V</mi><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><msub id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">α</mi><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">k</mi></msub></mfrac><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><divide id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1"></divide><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑉</ci><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1c">\frac{V_{k}}{\alpha_{k}}</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FEEL is the future of distributed training in wireless edge networks by virtue of its privacy preserving aspect. In this paper, we investigated scheduling of participant UEs in the collaborative training based on data-quality aspects. To this end, we proposed a data-quality based scheduling (DQS) algorithm for FEEL. DQS prioritizes devices with rich and diverse datasets, and punishes devices with poisoned datasets. We first defined the different components of the learning algorithm and the data-quality evaluation, namely dataset diversity and UE reputation. Then, we formulated a joint UE selection and bandwidth allocation problem, which we proved to be NP-hard. We presented our DQS algorithm for FEEL, which solves the problem in a greedy fashion. Finally, we evaluated the algorithm in different data poisoning scenarios, which showed the importance of data-quality evaluation components in scheduling UEs.
In the future, we will enhance our proposed algorithm to handle other attacks such as model poisoning and multi-task poisoning attacks. Furthermore, we will run evaluations on larger scale by testing on other datasets and larger number of UEs.</p>
