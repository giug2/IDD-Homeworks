<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized learning environment so that a group of clients can collaborate to train a global model at the server, while keeping their training data confidential. This paper studies how to launch over-the-air jamming attacks to disrupt the FL process when it is executed over a wireless network. As a wireless example, FL is applied to learn how to classify wireless signals collected by clients (spectrum sensors) at different locations (such as in cooperative sensing). An adversary can jam the transmissions for the local model updates from clients to the server (uplink attack), or the transmissions for the global model updates the server to clients (downlink attack), or both. Given a budget imposed on the number of clients that can be attacked per FL round, clients for the (uplink/downlink) attack are selected according to their local model accuracies that would be expected without an attack or ranked via spectrum observations. This novel attack is extended to general settings by accounting different processing speeds and attack success probabilities for clients. Compared to benchmark attack schemes, this attack approach degrades the FL performance significantly, thereby revealing new vulnerabilities of FL to jamming attacks in wireless networks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaborate to train a machine learning (ML) model under the orchestration of a server. A single client may not have sufficient processing power and sufficient training data to train a good ML model with high accuracy. FL aims to remove these limitations by utilizing multiple devices (each, utilizing its own training data in a confidential manner) in a client-server model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Clients train their local models using local (private) data and the server combines local models (e.g., by federated averaging (FedAvg)) to obtain a global model. Once the global model is updated, the server sends this model to clients so that they can update their local models. This process can be run several rounds until a termination condition (e.g., the number of rounds or the convergence of global model accuracy) is met. FL has a number of advantages, including low processing requirement per client, high reliability (global model achieves high accuracy even if local models of clients without FL may have low accuracy), privacy (clients send only their local models and do not share their local data), and communication efficiency (the amount of data for models is much smaller than local data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Given these advantages, FL has found applications in different domains including wireless systems such as mobile edge networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, 5G <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and 6G <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and can be executed over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> while accounting for wireless factors such as the possibility of packet errors and the availability of wireless resources</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study jamming as an external threat to FL when FL is executed over a wireless network (where a server and multiple clients communicate over wireless channels). As a wireless example, FL is used to train a signal classifier based on the I&amp;Q data collected by different clients (namely, spectrum sensors) at different locations (corresponding to a cooperative sensing setting). Suppose that there are background transmissions with different waveforms (e.g., BPSK or QPSK) such as in the case of primary and secondary users operating in a dynamic spectrum sharing environment. One emerging example for spectrum coexistence is in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> at 3.5GHz that is originally dedicated to incumbent (primary) users such as radar and now is opened to the use by 5G. In this setting, the environmental sensing capability (ESC) network (with distributed sensors) needs to detect (potentially with the use of ML) when the incumbent operation is active or idle (namely, distinguish the radar signals from other signals) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The received signals are affected by the channel gain and phase shift of the channel between the background transmitter and each sensor (namely, each client in the context of FL). The signal classifier should be general (not specific to a particular sensor) so that it can work for signals received by sensors at different locations. We use multiple sensors as clients to collect their local data samples individually and train their local models. There is also a server that trains the global model as a general signal classifier. When FL is applied in wireless network setting, each client and the server correspond to an individual node with transmit and receive capabilities. We show that this decentralized learning scheme in the context of FL can build the global model for the classifier that achieves high accuracy in test time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While vulnerabilities of FL have been extensively discussed in terms of model or data inference and manipulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, the application of FL in the wireless network environment raises a new attack surface.
In particular, the FL process can be attacked by jamming, where an adversary can jam either the uplink updates (local models sent from clients to the server) or the downlink updates (global model sent from the server to clients), or both. The uplink attack prevents some client models from reaching the server such that the global model may not be trained to be general for different clients (i.e., sensors at different locations in the signal classification case). Under the downlink attack, some clients do not receive updates from the server and thus their local models may not converge, which in turn prevents the global model from converging. The adversary may also perform both uplink and downlink attacks (at the same time). We consider an attack budget for the adversary, which can be measured by the average number of attacked clients per round. This budget may be imposed due to the energy constraint of the adversary (namely, for energy efficiency) or its need to avoid jammer detection (namely, for stealthiness). The adversary aims to reduce the accuracy of the trained global model without exceeding the attack budget. For that purpose, the adversary needs to select which set of clients to attack (i.e., which transmissions for model updates to jam). The FL process and the jamming attack on FL in a wireless network setting is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Jamming Attacks on Federated Learning in Wireless Networks This effort is supported by the U.S. Army Research Office under contract W911NF-20-C-0055.

In this setting, an adversary does not need to attack all selected clients in every round. Instead, it is necessary to attack a client only if it has a local update and will receive a global update. Thus, the consumed budget for a client can be less than one transmission per round. We extend the attack scheme to correctly account for the consumed budget with consideration of different processing powers. For performance evaluation, we consider four benchmark attack schemes: (i) The adversary jams all selected clients in every round.
(ii) The adversary first selects fast clients and then slow clients for the attack. (iii) The adversary first selects slow clients and then fast clients for the attack.

<p id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The jamming attack may not be always successful, i.e., it is possible that the jamming attack may not always make client or server transmissions fail due to channel effects. We model this case by considering a success probability associated with uplink and downlink attacks depending on channel effects. In this setting, we need to consider both model accuracy and attack success probability to select which clients to attack. For the uplink attack, we identify a metric based on diversity of remaining client local models to select clients and analyze this metric as a function of model accuracy and success probability. For the downlink attack, we use the normalized accuracy (accuracy divided by success probability) to select clients. For performance evaluation, we consider three benchmark attack schemes: (i) The adversary selects clients based on model accuracy only. (ii) The adversary selects clients based on attack success probability only (clients with high probability are selected). (iii) The adversary randomly selects clients to attack. We show that the designed attack scheme is better than all benchmark schemes.

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we design an effective attack scheme that selects a set of clients for uplink and/or downlink jamming attacks. We show that the downlink attack is more effective than the uplink attack and the combined attack (both downlink and uplink attack) is the best for the adversary in general. Overall, there is no significant need to change the set of clients to attack over time. Moreover, we show how to extend this attack to more general settings where different clients have different processing speeds and attack success probabilities.</p>

Each client has its own data and trains its own model in each round. Clients send their models to the server over wireless channels. The corresponding over-the-air transmissions of the clients and the server are separated over time or frequency (yielding no interference among each other). The server builds the global model by the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm. Then, the server broadcasts this model to all clients in one transmission (again over the air). Clients update their models by this global model. This completes one round for FL. The learning process runs over many rounds to build a global model.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now consider different jamming attacks on FL. An adversary can jam the transmission from a client to the server (uplink) or from the server to a client (downlink), or both. When the uplink attack is launched, the server can only update the global model based on the received client models (that are not jammed). As a consequence, the global may miss important information from clients under this attack. When the downlink attack is launched, the client under attack does not have the updated global model and thus can further update its model based on its previous local model only. As a consequence, its model does not have new information from the server (or other clients). There is a certain budget allocated for attacks, i.e., the average number of jamming actions per round, and the adversary must operate within this attack budget. The objective of the adversary is to reduce the global model accuracy (at the end of fixed time period) subject to the attack budget.</p>

Thus, the sets of clients for uplink and downlink attacks should be different and these sets can be determined by the local model accuracies. For uplink updates, the server needs to have a diverse set of data sources from clients. Thus, it is best to attack a client with low local model accuracy since it probably has some unique data not represented by the other clients’ data.
For downlink updates, it is necessary to achieve fast convergence. Thus, it is best to attack a client with high local model accuracy to prevent fast convergence (if downlink updates are available).</p>

<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to trying to overhear the local model directly, an adversary can also learn the local model’s accuracy indirectly. Suppose that clients use their local models to make spectrum access decisions, e.g., QPSK may be used by primary users while BPSK is used by secondary users. Then, a client may compete for spectrum access if BPSK is detected (and vacate the channel if QPSK is detected). This way, the adversary can observe client actions to learn the local model accuracy.</p>

Attacking both the uplink and the downlink is most effective but the level of jamming efforts, namely the number of times the (uplink or downlink) transmissions are jammed, is increased comparing with only attacking the uplink or the downlink (which is taken care of by imposing the attack budget). Attacking the downlink is better than attacking the uplink as the loss of global model update is more critical than the loss of local model updates. Note that the accuracy may not always decrease when the adversary attacks more clients because the incremental contribution of some clients on the global model may not be positive. The designed attack scheme is compared with a random attack scheme, where the adversary randomly selects which clients to attack. Our results show that this random attack scheme cannot effectively reduce the global model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">So far, we assumed that the jamming attack is always successful in terms of preventing the update from reaching the client and the server in the downlink and uplink attack, respectively. The next scenario that we consider in this section is that when the adversary attacks a client or a server, the underlying jamming action may not be always successful, e.g., the adversary can jam a physically close client or server with a high probability due to higher interference (jamming) power experienced at the client or server. The transmission of a local or global model update fails if the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) experienced (by a server or a client) is less than a threshold. Note that the SINR is a random variable and depends on the distributions of random wireless channels between the server and each client, as well as the channels from the jammer to the server and each client. We assume locations of the clients and the jammer are randomly distributed. Therefore, we assume a probabilistic update reception model based on the SINRs under the jamming attack. In the meantime, we assume that the processor speed is the same again for all clients so that the attack success probability and model accuracy are the two factors that we consider when designing the jamming attack on FL.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.2" class="ltx_p">For the uplink attack, Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ V Jamming Attack on Clients with Different Processing Speeds ‣ Jamming Attacks on Federated Learning in Wireless Networks This effort is supported by the U.S. Army Research Office under contract W911NF-20-C-0055.

For this case, the attack scheme that considers the model accuracy only may not be able to achieve the best attack performance. Another attack scheme that considers the attack success probability only may not be able to achieve the best performance either as it would ignore the model characteristics of clients. Therefore, it is essential to combine the model accuracy and the attack success probability when the adversary determines how to select which clients to attack.
For example, the best client for the downlink attack is client <math id="S6.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">3</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1">3</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1c">3</annotation></semantics></math> based on model accuracy while based on attack success probability, the best client to attack is client <math id="S6.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S6.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.2.m2.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p2.2.m2.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math> (the one with the largest attack success probability).

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we applied FL for a wireless signal classification task and studied various jamming attacks on FL that is performed over a wireless network (where the client and the server communicate over wireless channels). We first showed that without an attack, the global model trained by FL can classify signals with different modulations (received at different locations with different channel gains and phase shifts) with high accuracy. We considered an adversary to launch jamming attacks on FL with the objective of reducing the classification accuracy. In particular, the attack can either jam the local model updates to the server (uplink attack) or jam the global model updates from the server (downlink attack), or jam both. In all cases, we imposed an attack budget in terms of the average number of attacked clients and designed schemes to select clients for uplink/downlink attacks based on the client local model accuracy when there is no attack. To make this attack scheme practical, the adversary uses the overheard local models or the observed client actions based on local models after several rounds to predict the ranking of local model accuracies. We showed that this attack is very effective and reduces the classification accuracy significantly. We further studied the case that the set of selected clients changes over time and found that this dynamic setting cannot improve the attack performance. Then, we extended the jamming attack to more general settings, i.e., clients have different processing speeds or there are different attack success probabilities for clients, and showed that it can effectively reduce the global model accuracy compared to benchmark attack schemes.</p>
