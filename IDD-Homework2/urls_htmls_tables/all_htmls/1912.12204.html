<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Humans are capable of learning a new behavior by observing others to perform the skill. Similarly, robots can also implement this by imitation learning. Furthermore, if with external guidance, humans can master the new behavior more efficiently. So, how can robots achieve this? To address the issue, we present a novel framework named FIL. It provides a heterogeneous knowledge fusion mechanism for cloud robotic systems. Then, a knowledge fusion algorithm in FIL is proposed. It enables the cloud to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from local robots and generate guide models for robots with service requests. After that, we introduce a knowledge transfer scheme to facilitate local robots acquiring knowledge from the cloud. With FIL, a robot is capable of utilizing knowledge from other robots to increase its imitation learning in accuracy and efficiency. Compared with transfer learning and meta-learning, FIL is more suitable to be deployed in cloud robotic systems. Finally, we conduct experiments of a self-driving task for robots (cars). The experimental results demonstrate that the shared model generated by FIL increases imitation learning efficiency of local robots in cloud robotic systems.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In tradition imitation learning scenarios, demonstrations provide a descriptive medium for specifying robotic tasks. Prior work has shown that robots can acquire a range of complex skills through demonstrations, such as table tennis [1], drawer opening [2], and multi-stage manipulation tasks [3]. Nevertheless, there exist a number of problems in the application of imitation learning. For example, large amounts of data are required and sometimes they are heterogeneous. These drawbacks result in long training time for the robot and limited generalization performance. Cloud robotic system [4] can be adopted to increase the “learning efficiency” of robots, and federated imitation</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The cloud fuses knowledge which is from local robots. However, data heterogeneity hinders the process. This issue is generally regarded as a major challenge of cloud robotic systems [5]. To overcome this issue, a novel framework named FIL has been proposed. It increases imitation learning of local robots in heterogeneous data condition. As shown in Fig.1, it is inspired by the case that humans can learn more effectively if they have external guidance. With FIL, a robot is capable of taking advantage of knowledge from other robots. The student/teacher imitation learning in local robots will be incrseased with the guide model provided by FIL. To evaluate it, we conduct an autonomous driving task. Experimental result indicates that FIL enables robots to absorb knowledge from other robots and apply the knowledge to increase imitation learning efficiency and accuracy.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, FIL is proposed to increase the learning efficiency of each local robot in the cloud robotic system. The cloud generates a shared model and provides guidance services for each local robot. Methods that can achieve similar goals include transfer learning and meta-learning. Compared with these two approaches, FIL achieves heterogeneous knowledge fusion without raw data sharing. The related work are introduced as follows.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Transfer learning aims at improving the performance of target learners on target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related source domains, which is similar to the goal of FIL. In recent years, transfer learning research communities are mainly focused on deep transfer learning [6]. The techniques used in deep transfer learning include four categories: instances-based transfer learning, mapping-based transfer learning, network-based transfer learning, and adversarial based transfer learning [7].</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above approaches have made efforts for knowledge transferring between domains. Unfortunately, the difference between domains in a cloud robotic system can be large. Sometimes the data are collected with different kinds of sensors. Therefore, the datasets of local robots in the cloud robotic system may be heterogeneous. It is not possible to directly use the transfer learning technology. Therefore, the proposed framework first fuses heterogeneous knowledge rather than using transfer learning technology directly.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Meta-learning and the proposed framework have the same ultimate aim. Meta-learning, or learning to learn, is the science of systematically observing how different machine learning approaches perform on a wide range of learning tasks, and then learning from this experience, or meta-data, to learn new tasks much faster than otherwise possible [8]. Applications of meta-learning in robotics have achieved good results. Among these, One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning [9] and Domain-Adaptive Meta Learning (DAML) [10] by Abbeel’s lab are representative. Compared with the former that can enable robots to perform imitation learning from action videos of robots, DAML is an improved approach, which enables the robot to imitate human actions directly. DAML enables a robot learning to visually recognize and manipulate a new object after observing just one video demonstration from a human user. To enable this, DAML uses a meta-training phase where it acquires a rich prior over human imitation, using both human and robot demonstrations involving other objects. DAML extends a prior meta-learning approach to allow for learning cross domain correspondences and includes a temporal adaptation loss function.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the phase of meta-training is essential in DAML or other meta-learning approaches. It means that we have to obtain data of all local robots because the step of calculating loss to update gradients requires all task data (corresponding local data in the cloud robotic system). It is an impossible task considering limited communication. The more effect of meta-learning requires more data and a higher-capacity model to support. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the cloud to get all the data of local robots. Therefore, meta-learning approaches are unsuitable for the cloud robotic system in this work, although they may get higher accuracy.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge sharing is the key in the work, which means local robots share knowldge with each other. For this purpose, [11] presented a mental simulation service for the existing OPENEASE cloud engine. With this service available, agents can delegate computationally-expensive simulations to more powerful computing services. In addition, they created a SWI-Prolog library so that the developers and robots can describe the world state, self abilities and the problem. [12] proposed a framework for robots to reason on a central knowledge base which has ontologies and execution logs from other robots. This approach achieves knowledge exchanging with cloud robotic. [13] presented a platform that supports large-scale on-demand data collection for robot. All of the above three approaches can realize the fusion of local knowledge. Unfortunately, they can’t fuse the knowledge from heterogeneous data, which is addressed by this work.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Local robots acquire knowledge through imitation learning in FIL. Imitation learning is commonly posed either as behavioural cloning [14] or as inverse reinforcement learning [15], both of which require demonstrations. Imitation learning has empowered recent advances in learning robotic manipulation tasks by addressing shortcomings of reinforcement learning such as exploration [16] and reward specification [17]. The knowledge acquiring approach used in FIL of local robots belongs to behavioural cloning, which focuses on learning the expert’s policy using supervised learning. The way behavioural cloning works is quite simple. Given demonstrations of robots, we will divide these into state-action pairs. We treat these pairs as i.i.d. examples and finally, we apply supervised learning.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The framework of FIL is performed in Cloud-Robot-Environment setup. There are local robots, cloud servers, communication services and computing device. Local robots learn skills through imitation learning and the cloud server fuses knowledge. We develop a federated learning algorithm to fuse private models into the shared model in the cloud. With the shared model, the cloud server is capable of generating guide models corresponding to requests of local robots. After that, the local robots perform transfer learning based on the guide model. Finally, the final policy will be quickly obtained. As illustrated in Fig.2, we will explain the methodology in FIL with the example of a self-driving task.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the self-driving task, we typically collected three types of data. The three agents use three different types of dataset separately. Datasets of local robots are labeled but will not be sent to the cloud. Three different policy models will obtained by local training. RGB images will be trained by Agent A, and a private policy model (Private Model A) will be obtained. Actions of robots will be determined by the output which might be some actions or parameters. Similar processes occur in agent B and agent C. Outputs of the three private models are with same types. The inputs to each model are different: RGB images, depth images, and semantic segmentation images. Then the parameters of all three models will be uploaded to the cloud and fused there. Henceforth, the cloud will be capable of generating guide models for different types of input. When a local robot requests a service, the cloud will provide a guide model in correspondence with the type of sensor data. FIL can be performed either online or offline.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge fusion has been a focus of many approaches since the end of the 20th century. These studies focus on the construction of knowledge bases [18] [19] or knowledge representations [20] [21]. However, the above approaches that define the knowledge representation of the local robots are unsuitable for cloud robotic systems. We cannot determine how local robots obtain data and express knowledge. In our work, the proposed framework aims to make local robot learn efficiently and smart. In another word, it is one of the demonstrations of robot lifelong learning.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing machine learning approaches fuse knowledge by centralizing storage of training data. Consequently, these approaches are unattainable in cloud robotic systems with large scale local datasets considering the limited communications. In [22], the federated learning system was introduced. Therein, the mobile devices perform computation of model training locally on their training data according to the model released by the model owner. Such design enables mobile device to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data on the device. Similarly, multi-sensor data fusion is required by many robotic tasks, such as the navigation of self-driving cars, mobile robot SLAM. But it is impossible to upload all kinds of sensor data to the cloud. Therefore, we propose a federated imitation learning framework in cloud robotic systems to improve the ability of robots. In the proposed framework and algorithm, there is no need to upload raw sensor data to the cloud, only the parameters of the models are shared in the cloud.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.12" class="ltx_p">Fig.3 presents the knowledge fusion algorithm. Primary responsibility of the cloud is to label scenes. Before this, some data collecting for cloud training is necessary, and the types of these data should at least cover the types of local datasets. For example, in the self-driving task of this example, the RGB images, depth images and semantic segmentation images should be collected for the cloud. Thus, one scene has three types of sensor data. Each has a corresponding uploaded private model which provide its own suggestion of labelling to the cloud. And then, these suggestions will be congregated to produce a final label for this scene. The calculation approach of labelling can draw on some methods of ensemble learning which can be defined according to different application scenarios, in this case, we choose the median of outputs. As private models will output the steer of the agent. Agents usually make decisions of following the road, turning, obstacle avoiding, etc. Generally speaking, the output of the model includes two extreme cases: turning and no turning, where errors occur most. While Median can avoid extreme values in the evaluation. For example, if there were 5 local models and outputs of them for one scene are: -0.1, -0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.5. We will take 0.4 as the label of current scene. As data being labeled, cloud models will be trained immediately. Formula (1) to Formula (5) have summarized the whole process:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Noted that we only use the shared model in the cloud as a guide model for local robots. The shared model maintained in the cloud is a cautious policy model, which means it will not make serious mistakes in some private unstructured environments but the action might not be the best. Thus, it is necessary for every local robot to train its own policy model based on the shared model received from the cloud. This is the transfer learning process in FIL.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been a lot of valuable studies on transfer learning. Current research mainly focuses on transferring through the relationship between source domain distribution and target domain distribution. This method is unsuitable for cloud robotic systems because it requires raw data of local robots. Under the constraints of the above conditions, Layer Transfer is the transferable learning method that can be implemented. Layer Transfer means that some layers in the model trained by source data are copied directly and the remaining layers are trained by target data. The advantage of this is that target data only needs fewer parameters to be trained, thus avoiding over-fitting. It has faster training speed and higher accuracy. On different tasks, the layers that need to be transferred are often different. For example, in speech recognition, we usually copy the last layers and retrain the first layers. This is because the first layers of speech recognition neural network are the way to recognize the speaker’s pronunciation, and the last layers are the recognition. The latter layers have nothing to do with the speaker. In image recognition, we usually copy the front layers and retrain the back layers. This is because the first layers of the image recognition neural network are to identify whether there is a basic geometric structure, so it can be transferred. The latter layers are often abstract and cannot be transferred. So, which layers to be transferred are case by case.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As presented in Fig.4, in the work, we use front layers as feature extractors in the case of imitation learning. The decision model in the cloud can be used as the initial model for local training. In this way, cloud model can play a guiding role. It can speed up local training and increase the accuracy of local robots. In the training of local robots, the feature extraction layer is frozen and only the full connection layers are trained. If necessary, it can also adjust the relevant parameters in the process of back propagation. For example, some work may increase learning rate. After transfer learning, local robots successfully utilize knowledge from other robots in cloud robotic systems.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will present our experimental setup and the results. To verify the effectiveness of FIL, we have to answer two questions: 1) Is FIL capable of generating an effective shared model based on shared knowledge in cloud robotic systems? 2) have the shared model of FIL improved the learning process or accuracy of local robots? To answer the first question, we have conducted experiments to generate cloud models and compare its performance with general models. To answer the second question, we then have conducted experiments to compare the learning process and accuracy of local robots with FIL and without FIL.</p>

In the work, we have used Microsoft AirSim and CARLA as our simulator to evaluate the presented approach. In addition to have high-quality environments with realistic vehicle physics, AirSim and CARLA have a python API which allows for easy data collection and control.</p>

The simulated vehicle is controled using the keyboard by the driver. The car should be kept at a speed around 6m/s, collisions with cars or pedestrians should strive to be avoided, but traffic lights and stop signs will not be considered. As Fig.5 presents, we have used three different types of sensor data: RGB images, depth images and semantic segmentation images. Any of these three types of sensor data can make the agent to perform obstacle avoidance tasks within tolerable errors. The policy network mainly consists of convolution layers and fully connected layers. Then a linear layer followed by a softmax, and the value function by a linear layer. Its architecture presented in Fig. 6 is similar to VGG-16.</p>

The observations (images) are recorded by one central camera. The recorded control signal is the steering angle.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Once the three private policy networks been trained, the cloud will work to fuse their knowledge. As mentioned before, we assume that there are three companies train their policies by imitation learning with heterogeneous sensor data. Sharing the training data between agents or sending the raw data to the cloud is forbidden. So, the cloud server only gets the parameters of the three local networks and performs the knowledge fusion algorithm. Different types of sensor data is collected simultaneously from different environments in CARLA and Airsim before that. Then every scene in cloud will be labelled. The cloud generates local policy network 1 for company 1 based on RGB images, local policy network 2 for company 2 based on semantic segmentation images, and local policy network 3 for company 3 based on depth images. Then the parameters of these three private networks will be uploaded to the cloud. Finally, the cloud gets labels of datasets in the cloud. It will generate policy networks corresponding to different sensor requests. In this experiment, three policy networks will be generated. They are named cloud policies. The process in the cloud is unsupervised learning. There is no manual labels but cloud generation. For evaluation, we labeled some scenes to mark the result. In the simulation environment, the controller uses the policy network to control the robot.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 7 presents results of these six policy networks in some main challenging scenes to the car. From Fig.7, it is clear that the cloud model presents higher accuracy than local models. So that it can avoid errors of local models training from single training set collected by one type of sensors. We conducted 3 experiments, each one sets a different starting point. Then we evaluated the performance of robots in obstacle avoidance, turning and straight forward tasks. The results are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen from the experimental results that the cloud knowledge improves the local controller that is trained using general imitation learning. The controller based on cloud policies performs better. Especially the controller for RGB images.</p>

Here is something to explained is that there are semantic segmentation difference between CARLA and Airsim, so there is a unifying process for semantic segmentation images. Thirdly, three policies corresponding to different sensor data were generated. After that, we performed transferring learning with corresponded type of images and obtained transferred policies.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted the experiment as illustrated in Fig. 8 to evaluate the knowledge-transfer ability in FIL. As presented in Fig. 9, we compare the six models in a neighborhood environment. Corresponding to every type of training data, we obtained a pair of policies: a transferred policy and a general policy. So, there are three pairs of policies generated in the experiment. The performance of controllers based on these policies in key challenging tasks are presented in Fig. 10. The results are summarized in Table 2. From the results, we can see that the imitation learning models obtained in cloud robotic system perform significantly better in accuracy, compared with general models that trained by traditional imitation learning without shared knowledge.
FIL improves the training process of imitation learning with the help of shared knowledge. There is a pre-trained model from the cloud for transfer in local imitation learning. So, there is no need for local robots to learn from scratch. We present the comparison of train process in Fig 10. From the figure, we can see that the transferred policies have lower error starting point and the error value.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose an imitation learning framework for cloud robotic systems with heterogeneous sensor data sharing, named Federated Imitation Learning (FIL). FIL is capable of improving imitation learning efficiency and accuracy of local robots by taking advantage of knowledge from other robots in the cloud robotic system. Additionally, we propose the knowledge fusion algorithm and introduce a transfer method in FIL. Our approach is able to fuse heterogeneous knowledge of local robots. Finally, the framework and algorithms are verified in a self-driving task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future work, we expect to research the scalability problem of the platform. How to scale FIL if there are more autonomous cars or more types of sensor data? Although FIL is capable of dealing this issue by simpily expanding the cloud dataset, further work on convergence justification of the fusion process is needed.</p>
