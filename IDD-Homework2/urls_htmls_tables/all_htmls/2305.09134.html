<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities, intelligent healthcare systems, and various real-world applications have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of data, often analyzed using different Machine Learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) has been acknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where multiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data. However, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the training process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by each FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability available in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart contract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL) management system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local training policy control on the FL participants’ side. This policy control is used to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process follows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart contract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation process. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on blockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global model and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses smart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine learning models. We conducted multiple experiments with various machine learning architectures and datasets to evaluate our proposed framework, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet of Things (IoT) has been involved in various services, including smart cities, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturer, to enhance the quality of life, the efficiency of urban services, operation, and competitiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A distributed network made up of IoT devices connected via wired or wireless networks continuously interacts with the outside world to provide a variety of data sources, including images, text, video, and other sorts of data. The distributed network also enables efficient and effective sharing of IoT data resources and information. However, due to the substantial amount of data generated by IoT sensors, an intelligent system is necessary to operate the system autonomously, as IoT devices are typically resource-limited and cannot independently execute machine learning algorithms. With the aid of edge computing, IoT clusters can form intelligent networks when combined with machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, having an effective machine learning model necessitates extensive data from many IoT clusters, which is often difficult to collect and utilize due to privacy concerns, security risks, and other associated challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A new type of distributed machine learning approach called federated learning (FL) controls the training process without storing the data in the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FL is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning protocol that reduces data communication costs by employing a model-first strategy. This strategy allows centralized servers to maintain a global model and transmit its parameters to connected devices and systems instead of gathering large datasets. The edge devices then perform the local training process using the global model received from the server and send the trained local model back for a global model aggregation process. As a result, edge computing can have a good machine learning model without ever sending data to the cloud or to an external party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent studies, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed federated learning to enable multiple participants to collaboratively train a model by exchanging local model updates with a parameter server. This method is more secure than centralized training as machine learning models learn from IoT data without relying on a third-party cloud to keep their data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. While federated learning guarantees the privacy of local data by generating a global model without sharing data among participants, current FL architecture still faces numerous challenges, such as model integrity and transparency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, an adversary could tamper with the local or global model and result in misclassification.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several existing defense methods mainly focus on securing the training process using encrypted training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> or leveraging a trusted execution environment (TEE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> to perform the training process. However, the current approach is inefficient since the training process requires significant computation resources and takes a long time. Moreover, the aggregation server and participants cannot validate the machine learning model they receive. Hence, an auditable and verifiable machine learning management system is needed to enhance the security of federated learning architecture.</p>

Initially, blockchain applications were mainly limited to cryptocurrencies and financial transactions. However, with the development of smart contracts, blockchain technology has opened up a range of new applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are triggered when certain conditions are met, enforcing the rules of the agreement between parties. Once deployed to a blockchain network, smart contracts are immutable and tamperproof, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient way to conduct business in a decentralized, trustless environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use an IoT-based industry scenario to explore and highlight the existing challenges of current federated learning. We analyze the implications of these challenges with respect to the accuracy of machine learning models, data privacy, and security. In this context, assume that multiple smart manufacturers are located in different areas, each equipped with a set of IoT devices with sensors that capture and generate image data. As the IoT sensors are resource-constrained devices and cannot execute any machine learning algorithms, each manufacturer has an edge server as computing resources to perform machine learning tasks with their local datasets. However, the generated machine learning models have only moderate accuracy due to dataset limitations. Therefore, the edge servers from each manufacturer participate in a federated learning scenario to improve the accuracy of their models. In Federated Learning, local models from the manufacturer’s edge server are gathered and aggregated to construct a highly precise machine learning model without sending any local datasets to the aggregation server. Afterward, the global model is sent back to the edge server for another round of federated learning. The global model is then used to recognize objects with greater accuracy upon achieving the desired accuracy.</p>

In the current federated learning setup, each participant sends their local model to the cloud for the aggregation process. However, the aggregation server receives the local model without verifying the given local model, raising the risk of a local model being altered or poisoned. For example, an attacker can alter the local model parameters, causing a faulty local model. Unfortunately, the current FL architecture does not check whether the participants did the training process properly. Thus, validating the local model is essential to protect it from various security risks.</p>

Specifically, they discuss a range of topics, including management, security, privacy, scalability, and blockchain, to improve the current FL architecture.</p>

Moreover, other works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> leverage TEEs to perform the aggregation process in a federated learning scenario, thus improving the security of the federated learning, albeit with increased time and computing power consumption.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain was initially developed for cryptocurrency purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Since blockchain can maintain data integrity, it has evolved to enable distributed data storage across numerous computational nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Combining blockchain with federated learning (FL) can ensure the integrity of the machine learning model. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a method to guarantee the privacy and security of a system using blockchain. Their method uses smart contracts and encryption to protect patient data from collision attacks. As the original federated learning architecture relies on a centralized server, researchers now leverage the blockchain in their federated learning methodology to secure the system. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a blockchain-based federated learning architecture is proposed, where each participant stores their locally trained model in the shared blockchain. However, since the current privacy measures do not protect the local models, other participants can gain access to them, raising serious privacy concerns. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the author proposed a blockchain-based FL healthcare scenario in which the local model is sent from the blockchain. However, model aggregation is done on a single server, and there are no verification processes in place before the aggregation, leaving the system vulnerable to a single point of failure and tampering attack. To address this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> designed a verifiable local model using a multi-signature scheme. Each FL participant must sign the model for each FL round, and the cloud verifies each model for the aggregation process. However, the computation cost of the multi-signature scheme can be high when many clients join the FL round. To overcome this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a verifiable aggregation for FL, which follows the idea of blockchain and uses a hash to calculate the digest for validation. Nonetheless, the aggregation and hashing operations are performed on a centralized server.</p>

In the initial round of federated learning, each FL participant receives the global model with a smart contract. The smart contract is executed in the participant’s edge server to verify that the initial model has not been tampered. However, the proposed approach’s smart contract is only utilized to verify the model’s integrity; it has no information regarding the training and aggregation process during the model’s development.</p>

The framework comprises private P2P identification and private FL modules, managed with scalable smart contracts to facilitate distributed collaborative mining with dynamic quantitative incentives.

However, due to the limited dataset of the machine learning model produced by the smart factory, the accuracy of the model may not be high enough to reach the desired level of precision and accuracy.
To address this limitation, the decentralized machine learning approach can be implemented by allowing the edge servers to collect and share data with other edge servers in the same cluster. By combining the data from different smart factories, the machine learning model can be trained with a larger and more diverse dataset, thus increasing its accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the experiments, we selected two widely used datasets to benchmark the machine learning process: CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. These datasets are commonly used for evaluation in the machine learning framework. Thus, we utilized them to assess the performance of our proposed framework. The proposed method uses the dataset to train and test the local model on the client side. When performing the experiments, we split the training and test sets. We evenly distributed the training and test sets amongst the federated learning participants based on the number of clients. MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> consists of 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28×28-pixel image of a handwritten digit. CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> consists of 50,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set of 10 different classes (such as cars, dogs, and planes), and there are 6,000 images in each class, where each image contains 32×32-colored pixels.

AlexNet can also use batch normalization layers for stability and efficient training. In terms of parameters, LeNet has around 60,000, while AlexNet has around 60 million.

The peak evaluation accuracy for both methods is 70% when applied to CIFAR-10 datasets. When using AlexNet architecture, both methods can reach 80%. This is because LeNet architecture is smaller, with up to sixty million parameters.

This experiment reveals the local model training time cost difference between the original federated learning setup and using the smart policy local training process. To perform the comparison, we run one round of federated learning using default settings, with clients’ nodes ranging from two to twenty clients. We then perform another round of federated learning by enabling the local training policy. In this experiment, we concurrently perform the federated learning process to observe the effect of the training policy on the training process. Results show the local model training time cost required by LeNet and AlexNet using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>

The time cost is consistently stable from two to five clients but begins to increase gradually when there are ten to twenty clients. When using the LeNet learning model in a policy-based training setup, the average time cost increases by 1-2 minutes compared to the original FL setup.

Compared to LeNet, the overall time of AlexNet is higher due to its larger number of layers. The time cost in the AlexNet model steadily increases when it has five clients. The time cost when performing federated learning with a local model training policy also increases slightly compared to the original FL setup. The experimental results from both models demonstrate that the time cost increases linearly for both the original FL training and policy-based FL training. Policy-based local training is slightly higher than the original one since every FL participant needs to execute the training policy contract before the training process commences.</p>

Comparing the original federated learning setup with the policy-based aggregation approach, the experiment shows the global model aggregation time cost difference between the two. We run one round using default federated learning with clients’ nodes ranging from two to twenty, and another round of federated learning by enabling the aggregation policy. The results demonstrate the global model aggregation time cost required by LeNet and AlexNet using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The results of our experiment demonstrate that the time cost of the original FL setup and policy-based aggregation increases linearly. Moreover, the application of a machine learning model using CIFAR-10 is more time-consuming due to its RGB color. Our proposed aggregation method has a slightly higher time cost than the original FL architecture; however, this slight cost is justified by its secure management system, which leverages policy aggregation smart contracts to record and verify during the global model aggregation process.</p>

In this experiment, we deployed the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain emulator (Ganache) without deploying it in the real Ethereum network. Our proposed method requires 3537625 gas for two smart contracts, while Saini et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> requires 5783731 for three smart contracts, and Ouyang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> requires 10424901 gas for three smart contracts. Hence, our proposed method has the lowest gas cost compared to the other approaches. The more information stored on the smart contract, the higher the gas cost during the deployment. For example, Ouyang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> store the models on the smart contract, which results in a high deployment cost. In contrast, we only store the hash of the model on the smart contract so the other party can verify the model based on the hash value stored on the smart contract. In a real-world scenario, these values can be further reduced by using low-cost consensus mechanisms, such as PoS, DPoS, or PBFT.</p>

In this framework, we leverage smart contracts as the underlying technology to develop the training and aggregation policy. The correct utilization of smart contracts for policy control can achieve transparency in the management because all functions executed in the smart contract are reflected on the events log of the smart contract and the Ethereum blockchain network. Therefore, federated learning participants and aggregation nodes can not interrupt the training and aggregation process.</p>

Suppose the attacker attempts to tamper with or poison the local model prior to sending it to the cloud for aggregation. In that case, the local model hash will not match the one recorded on the training policy contract and will therefore be rejected.

In a typical federated learning setup, the aggregation server collects the local training models from each participant and performs the aggregation without verifying the accuracy of the individual local models. In our proposed method, we leverage smart contracts as the base of the aggregation policy to enhance the regular federated learning process. The smart contract will validate the integrity of the sent local model before the aggregation process and records the global model after the aggregation process. The FL participants then use this information when receiving the latest global model. The results indicate that our proposed method only adds a maximum of 2 seconds for executing the policy-based aggregation. Thus, our method provides an effective way to secure the federated learning process while maximizing efficiency.</p>

Blockchain is a compelling and revolutionary decentralized technology that provides data integrity and security by leveraging a secure and resilient network resistant to malicious activities from untrusted parties. Decentralization makes it virtually impossible for attackers to compromise the network, as it would require tampering with every node on the network. In this proposed framework, blockchain technology is utilized to securely store the global model, which has been aggregated from multiple sources. Furthermore, digital signatures and hashes are employed to ensure the integrity of the global model so that attackers cannot modify or corrupt the model, as it would alter the hash value and, consequently, cause the signature verification to fail. Therefore, blockchain technology provides a secure, reliable, and immutable platform for storing the global model, thus ensuring data integrity and enabling distributed decisions.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes smart policy control for the secure management of federated learning systems. The primary purpose of this work is to ensure that the local models of all participants have the same standard, and each client can verify the integrity of the global model before the next training round. In this framework, we develop a smart policy for local training and aggregation based on a smart contract. The smart contract-based local training policy records the core information when FL participants perform the local training process. The policy control management system then verifies each of the sent local models according to the given training policy contract. Upon successful verification, the local model is sent to the blockchain for aggregation. The aggregation policy records essential information during the aggregation process. Once completed, the global model is securely stored on the blockchain to be subsequently distributed to the federated learning participants in accordance with the policy. After analyzing the experimental results, our proposed method maintains the accuracy of machine learning and provides auditability and verifiability throughout the training and aggregation procedure, albeit with a slight increase in time consumption. Compared to existing work, our methodology has the lowest gas consumption during deployment. Building on this, we plan to develop more efficient blockchain storage and leverage a secure aggregation protocol for additional security measures. Furthermore, we intend to extend our work in the future to support a heterogeneous model, leading to more efficient and secure machine learning.</p>
