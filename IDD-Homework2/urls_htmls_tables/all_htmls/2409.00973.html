<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Infrared and visible dual-modality tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection can achieve robust performance even in extreme scenes by fusing complementary information.
Most current methods design task-specific frameworks, which are limited in generalization across multiple tasks.
In this paper, we propose a fusion-guided infrared and visible general framework, IVGF, which can be easily extended to many high-level vision tasks.
Firstly, we adopt the SOTA infrared and visible foundation models to extract the general representations.
Then, to enrich the semantics information of these general representations for high-level vision tasks, we design the feature enhancement module and token enhancement module for feature maps and tokens, respectively.
Besides, the attention-guided fusion module is proposed for effectively fusing by exploring the complementary information of two modalities.
Moreover, we also adopt the cutout&amp;mix augmentation strategy to conduct the data augmentation, which further improves the ability of the model to mine the regional complementary between the two modalities.
Extensive experiments show that the IVGF outperforms state-of-the-art dual-modality methods in the semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.
The detailed ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each module, and another experiment explores the anti-missing modality ability of the proposed method in the dual-modality semantic segmentation task.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Infrared and visible imaging are two common modalities in visual perception.
Infrared images utilize the thermal radiation of objects for imaging, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of low-illumination environments, but they lack color and detailed information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, visible images are formed by the reflection of objects, making them rich in color, texture, and details.
However, they are less effective in adverse environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
The distinct imaging characteristics of these modalities make them highly complementary, enabling dual-modality imaging to achieve all-weather perception capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, research on all-weather high-level vision tasks in infrared and visible modalities can be primarily divided into two approaches: the image fusion-based method and the task-specific design method, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The image fusion-based methods typically design an image fusion framework and then take the fused images as the input of the existing detection/segmentation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, some works utilize the high-level vision task to guide fusion methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
However, the main purpose of these methods is to obtain high-quality fused images.
The task-specific design methods aim to fully utilize the complementary information of dual modalities to improve the performance of high-level vision tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
These methods can achieve results beyond the reach of a single modality, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to analyze and understand the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Although these task-specific designs can obtain superior performance on a single task, they are challenging to be generalized across multiple tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge of limited generalization, the foundation model has been proposed.
These foundation models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> demonstrate powerful learning capabilities of general representations and can achieve results surpassing task-specific design methods by integrating with existing task heads <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Such foundation models can improve the performance of various high-level vision tasks and reduce the design complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Currently, there are relevant foundation models in the single modality, such as infrared <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, remote sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and video <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Besides, many foundation models have also emerged in multimodal communities such as text-image and video-image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
However, research within the infrared and visible dual-modal community remains limited, and training such models requires millions of well-aligned images.
Obtaining these images is challenging because the dual-modal images are usually captured asynchronously, and the fields of view of dual-modal sensors differ significantly.
Moreover, aligning these images accurately is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming.
Hence, it is natural to come out with a question: can we build an infrared and visible general framework upon the existing foundation models that can be seamlessly integrated with high-level vision tasks without a large number of paired images?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, directly summing the features from an infrared foundation model with those from a visible foundation model appears to be a viable solution.
However, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-E Ablation Study of IVGF ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> (baseline), our experimental findings suggest this approach is suboptimal.
It may be because simply combining the general features of infrared and visible foundation models remains two issues.
(1) The general features need to enrich the semantic information further.
(2) Summing the features can not fully integrate the complementary information between the two modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we explore the characteristics of infrared and visible images and propose a fusion-guided Infrared and Visible General Framework (IVGF) by utilizing the state-of-the-art foundation models.
Firstly, to avoid the requirement for a large number of well-aligned images, we directly combine our infrared foundation model InfMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and the well-designed visible foundation model MCMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> as our basic framework.
Then, to explore more semantic information, we design the feature enhancement module and the token enhancement module.
The feature enhancement module is designed to enhance the semantic information of the feature maps obtained from the encoder blocks of the single-modality foundation models, while the token enhancement module is suitable for the tokens obtained in the encoder block3.
Besides, we design an attention-guided fusion module that adopts the cross-modality attention mechanism to fuse visible and infrared features based on their complementary characteristics.
Moreover, to help further mine the regional complementary between the two modalities, we design the cutout&amp;mix augmentation, which encourages the model to recover the masked information with another modality and exposes the model to more diverse samples during training.</p>

In the field of visible modality, models such as EVA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and MCMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have achieved outstanding performance in various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification.
In the field of remote sensing modality, models such as SatMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and MTP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> have reduced the design complexity of tasks like remote sensing object classification, segmentation, and recognition.
Recently, in the field of infrared modality, the foundation model InfMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been introduced, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and small object detection.

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, benefiting from the efficient scalability and modality inclusiveness of the Transformer structure, a large number of multi-modality foundational models have emerged.
As a pioneer in multimodal foundational models, CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> has made significant contributions to various tasks in the language-visual domain.
Subsequently, many multimodal foundational models have been built upon the CLIP.
For instance, Meta-Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and Onellm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> leveraged the pre-trained weights of CLIP’s text encoder to establish a multi-modality, multi-task integration framework.
Moreover, MultiMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> was inspired by the idea of masking image modeling, and accomplished multi-modality, multi-task learning through masked self-supervised learning.
Additionally, this approach supports both single-modality and multi-modality inputs concurrently.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned single-modality and multi-modality methods require a large number of images for self-supervised learning.
However, due to the lack of well-aligned infrared and visible images, the exploration of foundation models in the infrared and visible dual-modal community remains in its infancy.
In this paper, we propose a first infrared and visible general framework based on existing foundation models, fully leveraging the complementarity of the two modalities and avoiding the requirement for hundreds of paired images.</p>

Infrared and visible semantic segmentation ensures reliable performance under extreme conditions such as overexposure, smoke, and darkness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
Currently, the mainstream approach involves designing effective fusion modules that leverage the complementary and differential characteristics of dual-modal images.
Lv et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> explored the complementary relationship of dual-modal images by designing a context-aware interaction network, achieving promising results on public infrared and visible semantic segmentation datasets.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> adopted a bridging-then-fusing strategy to achieve multi-level fusion of dual-modal features, reducing the disparity between the two modalities.
Shin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed a complementary random masking strategy and the self-distillation loss to prevent over-reliance on a single modality and to extract complementary and meaningful representations, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the network.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> designed a unified fusion framework for RGB-X semantic segmentation tasks.
Specifically, the cross-modal feature rectification module is designed to calibrate dual-modal features, and the feature fusion module is deployed to facilitate a sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> extensively explored semantic segmentation models integrating an arbitrary number of modalities, yielding good segmentation results under various adverse conditions.</p>

Cao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> proposed a lightweight fusion module capable of fusing inputs from different modalities through the designed channel switching and spatial attention mechanisms.

Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> proposed a bi-modal salient detection architecture called saliency prototype network (SPNet), which dynamically allocates fusion weights during the fusion process.</p>

Our method contains five main components: two modality-specific backbones, the feature enhancement module (FEM), the attention-guided fusion (AGF) module, the token enhancement module (TEM), and task-specific heads.
Moreover, we design a cutout&amp;mix augmentation (CMA), which helps to mine the regional complementary between the two modalities.
Specifically, we choose the well-trained encoders of InfMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and MCMAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> as backbones for infrared and visible modalities, respectively.

During this process, we propose the feature enhancement to enrich the semantic representations for the general representations.
At the same time, we design the token enhancement module to enrich the semantic information of the tokens, which are obtained in the encoder block3.
After that, the attention-guided fusion module is proposed to fuse the dual-modality features according to their complementary characteristics and obtain the fused features <math

It contains five main components: two modality-specific backbones, the feature enhancement module, the token enhancement module, the attention-guided fusion module, and the task-specific head.
The backbone can extract the general representation of each modality.
The feature enhancement and token enhancement modules are designed for feature maps and tokens, respectively.
The attention-guided fusion module integrates the complementary information from two modal features.

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key for infrared and visible tasks is to mine the regional complementary between the two modalities.
Hence, we design the cutout&amp;mix augmentation (CMA) to encourage the model to recover the masked information with another modality and allow it to see more diverse samples during training, thereby improving its generalization ability.
This strategy consists of two parts: cutout augmentation and cutmix augmentation.
The cutout augmentation is designed to facilitate the learning of adaptive cross-modality regional complementarity, the artificial optically-impaired regions are randomly created in a random modality.
The cutmix augmentation involves randomly cutting and pasting patches between two model images, thus creating new training samples.
An example is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III-E The Cutout&amp;mix Augmentation ‣ III Method ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

We can see from the table that compared with the CDDFuse, the proposed method outperforms it a lot.
Besides, our method performs much better than other task-specific design methods.
This may be because our method could mine more comprehensive complementary information during the end-to-end training.
Specifically, the proposed method outperforms EAEFNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> by 5.5%.
Compared with other methods, our method improves more than 5.5% on the metric of mIoU.
This significant performance improvement shows that our method helps to extract powerful semantic representations.</p>

As described in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Method ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, the feature enhancement module contains the cross-modality spatial integration and the intra-modality channel attention.
We report the experiment results in different settings as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-E1 Effect of the Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) ‣ IV-E Ablation Study of IVGF ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.
In this table, CA represents intra-modality channel attention, SI represents cross-modality spatial integration, and ‘parallel’ and ‘serial’ indicate that we combine CA and SI in parallel and serial configurations, respectively.
As shown in this table, the performance of the semantic segmentation and object detection tasks is optimal when we merge the CA and SI in parallel.</p>

‘W/O FEM+TEM’ indicates that the FEM and TEM modules are not adopted, while ‘W/ FEM+TEM’ indicates that the FEM and TEM modules are included in the proposed method.
We can see that after adding the FEM, the semantic information is more obvious, especially in the infrared modality.
For instance, the ‘bump’ class is barely visible in the infrared images.
However, the cross-modality spatial integration introduces relevant information from the visible modality into the infrared features.
These figures demonstrate the semantic enhancement capability of the FEM and TEM.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modal missing is a common challenge in dual-modal tasks.
It occurs when one of the modality images is unavailable due to the environment or imaging equipment.
We report the segmentation performance when either the infrared or visible modality is missing to show the robustness of our proposed method against modal missing.
When one modality is missing, we replace it with the corresponding image from the other modality and conduct these experiments on the MFNet and MSRS datasets.
The experiment results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-G Discussion on the Situation of Modality missing ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

While the infrared modality is missing (line 2), the semantic segmentation performance decreases by 9.8% and 7.2%, respectively.
However, compared with the results in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-A Datasets and Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Datasets and Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-G Discussion on the Situation of Modality missing ‣ IV Experiment ‣ IVGF: The Fusion-Guided Infrared and Visible General Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, we observe that our missing modality results are comparable with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) dual-modality methods.
This demonstrates that our method can handle missing modalities in the segmentation task.
Meanwhile, we observe a significant performance decrease when the visible modality is missing in the MSRS dataset.
This may be because visible images provide more useful information compared to those in the MFNet dataset.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a fusion-guided infrared and visible general framework, named IVGF, which can be easily extended to dual-modal high-level vision tasks.
We adopt our InfMAE and the MCMAE as the foundation models to extract the general representations of infrared and visible modalities.
The feature enhancement and token enhancement modules are designed to enrich the semantic information of general representations.
Additionally, we design an attention-guided fusion module to learn the complementary information from both modalities and fuse them using a cross-attention mechanism.
Besides, we also adopt the cutout&amp;mix augmentation strategy to conduct the data augmentation, which further improves the ability of the model to mine the regional complementary between the two modalities.
Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed IVGF method in dual-modality semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.
The experimental results show that our method can obtain better experimental results than other SOTA methods.
In addition, we discuss some ablations in the IVGF to show the effectiveness of each module.
We hope our work will provide some insights into the infrared and visible multimodal and multitasks domains.</p>
