<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Recently, smart cities, healthcare system and smart vehicles have raised challenges on the capability and connectivity of state of the art Internet of Things (IoT) devices, especially for the devices in hot spots area.
Multi-access edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention.
However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultra dense network (UDN) scenarios.
Ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of:
i) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage and service resources);
ii) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies;
and iii) privacy and security protection schemes.
Thus, we first propose an intelligent ultra-dense edge computing (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into 5G ultra-dense edge computing networks.
Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (<span id="id1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span>) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively.
The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation and service caching placement.
We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the <span id="id1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices’ data privacy.
Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the <span id="id1.1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to <math id="id1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="31.87\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">31.87</mn><mo id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">31.87</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.1.m1.1c">31.87\%</annotation></semantics></math>.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, the advances in cloud computing and communication technology are spawning a variety of intelligent mobile and IoT devices, such as smart phones, Google Glass and smart meters.
Accompanied by the intelligent devices, multiple resource-intensive mobile and IoT applications are designed to enhance the user experience, such as wearable cognitive assistance, augmented reality, and collaborative 3D gaming.
Such applications use complex algorithms for camera tracking and object recognition, require extensive computation power, high speed connection, real-time feedback and a variety of cloud computing services.
Furthermore, the number of such mobile and IoT devices is anticipated to have an explosive growth in the 5G era, which will result in the congestion of the cloud computing network.
In light of this, multi-access edge computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and ultra dense network (UDN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> are expected as effective solutions to meet the computation and communication requirements, respectively.
MEC provides a capillary distribution of cloud computing capabilities to the edge of network, enabling rich services and applications in close proximity to edge devices.
UDN can offer adequate base band resources by deploying more base stations close to the edge users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a new research paradigm named ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> emerges.
It integrates MEC with UDN by deploying MEC servers on the base stations of UDN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
This integration not only achieves lower data transmission delay, but also meets the requirement of real-time computing.
However, how to effectively integrate MEC with UDN becomes a critical problem in the future development of 5G, and is under-explored to the best of our knowledge.
Note that, an effective integration should consider the following key issues:
<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">i) Full use of system resources:</span>
by leveraging computation offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, a mobile application can be split into local parts (usually communication intensive) and offloaded parts (usually computation intensive).
Then, an edge server allocates a variety of system resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage and service) to process the offloaded parts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The problem becomes extremely complex in the UDEC environments, since UDEC has massive edge devices and edge servers with heterogeneous computation resources (e.g., CPU, GPU) and communication links (e.g., cellular and D2D).
Thus, it is necessary to fully and efficiently utilize the system resources to improve the UDEC performance.
<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ii) Dynamic and low-cost scheduling:</span>
the system resources in UDEC are usually diverse (e.g., various service caching placement strategies, different CPU frequencies of mobile devices and cloud/edge servers, memory) and time-varying (e.g., network disconnection, channel state and backhaul latency).
The distributed and heterogeneous natures of the resources make the scheduling process more complex.
Moreover, computation offloading requires real-time application partitioning and low overhead resource allocation.
Thus, dynamic and real-time scheduling schemes are required to enhance the quality of service (QoS) of edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">iii) Privacy&amp;security-preserving services:</span> are crucial to the MEC-enabled UDN, since the interplay of heterogeneous edge devices and the migration of services across devices cause a lot of security and privacy issues.
Specifically, for many cloud services, their related databases/libraries usually contain edge users’ sensitive information (e.g., location, account information and medical records in real-life situations).
Edge users may not trust the remote cloud server, thus unwilling to offload the computation with their private data to the server.
Therefore, edge users are prone to offload their private data to their trusted nearby edge servers with privacy-preserving techniques, such as Points-of-Interest Services and Traffic Information Services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, an integrated framework is required to jointly optimizes the application partitioning, resource allocation and service caching placement for UDEC with privacy protection.
However, the delay sensitivity varies for the above issues, and the complexity of the optimization problem is very high for the joint optimization problem.
Recently, deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have attracted much attention of researchers in edge computing fields.
Deep learning is widely exploited in wireless communication networks (e.g., 4G and VANET) to obtain timely decision making (e.g., automatic resource allocation and robotics).
Blockchain provides reliable connections and management of the computation, communication and storage resources within the massive distributed edge nodes of UDEC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Thus, there is a pressing need to explore a novel deep learning and blockchain based scheduling approach for UDEC.
In addition, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is regarded as a useful tool for training deep learning agents in a distributed manner, as FL can protect the personal data privacy in the model training process.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To integrate cloud computing functionalities into wireless networks, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) develops the concept of multi-access edge computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> that is expected to play a key role in meeting the requirements of 5G.
Edge servers, which are located at the edge of MEC networks, can provide computing resource, storage capability, connectivity and various services for edge devices.
However, due to the limited computation resource and storage capability of the edge servers, only a few edge devices can be served by each single server.
Thus, dense deployment of edge servers in MEC is required, especially in some heavily populated urban areas (e.g., shopping malls and train stations).
Ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is designed to tackle the above challenges, by deploying MEC servers on the base stations in ultra dense network (UDN).
Due to the dense deployment of the edge servers, UDEC can provide a huge computing functionalities and a variety of services close to edge users, in order to meet the low latency demand of 5G.
For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> study the mobility management issue of UDEC.
They propose a new user-centric energy-aware mobility management (EMM) scheme to optimize communication and computation delay.
At the same time, they also consider the long-term energy consumption constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a lot of works pay much attention to the computation offloading issue of UDEC.
For example, in order to reduce energy consumption, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> propose a greedy-based offloading scheme in a multi-user ultra-dense MEC server scenario.
However, only one mobile device is considered in their model.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> study the computation offloading issue in UDEC.
They propose a game-theoretical offloading scheme that can jointly optimized task offloading, computation frequency scaling and transmit power allocation.
Thus, the energy consumption on the mobile terminal side can be minimized.
However, service caching placement is ignored in this article.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, edge intelligence (EI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, aiming to integrate artificial intelligence (especially deep learning) services into edge computing, has attracted much attention.
On the one hand, EI aims to push artificial intelligence computations from remote cloud to the network edge, thus to achieve various real-time and reliable intelligent services.
For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> design a food recognition system for dietary assessment by leveraging EI.
The system operates in the edge computing environments, aims to obtain the best-in-class recognition accuracy, as well as real-time recognition.
On the other hand, EI also has the potential to solve various network optimization problems (i.e., resource allocation and offloading decision).
For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> present an integrated framework that jointly optimize resource allocation, content caching, and computation offloading for vehicular network.
In order to solve the problem of high complexity of the joint optimization problem, they propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach to achieve automatic decision making.
However, the corresponding training time is very long, the delay sensitivity for different optimization objectives (e.g., wireless resource allocation and content caching placement) is neglected.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to the advantages of security, privacy and scalability of blockchain.
Integrating blockchain to edge computing has been widely studied in recent years.
First, blockchain plays a key role in the secure data transmission for edge computing networks.
For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> design a blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture to provides low-cost and secure access to the fog computing networks.
The proposed framework also uses software defined networking (SDN) based controller to minimized the end-to-end delay between edge devices and system resources.
Then, the decentralized P2P data storage manner of blockchain can increase the availability and scalability of edge computing networks.
Since edge computing networks keep the data close to edge devices in separate storage locations.
For example, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> propose a novel blockchain system for edge computing networks.
The system stores metadata items onto blocks instead of actual data of end users by compressing the storage of blocks.
They also provide a strategy that can achieve optimal places to store data and blocks.
Last but not least, blockchain also enables computation offloading in edge computing networks.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> propose a blockchain-enabled computation offloading strategy in mobile edge computing environments.
The main objective of the strategy is to guarantee data integrity in the computation offloading process.
They also use the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) to achieve a balanced resource allocation strategy.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The I-UDEC is realized by enhancing the following three main functions of UDEC, i.e., i) computation offloading, ii) resource allocation and iii) service caching placement.
Computation offloading plays a critical role of UDEC, since edge devices can offload their computation intensive tasks to their nearby resourceful edge servers.
Thus, real-time offloading decision making can speed up the task execution time as well as saving the battery lifetime of edge devices.
To this end, the computation offloading process is enhanced by an artificial intelligence approach (i.e., deep Q-learning, as will be explained in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) to achieve real-time decision making.
On the other hand, during computation offloading, some security issues (e.g., jamming attacks and sniffer attacks) could be launched to disable the UDEC.
Thus, secure blockchain communication (including encryption, addressing and so on) is applied to ensure the efficient and reliable cooperation of UDEC networks.
In UDEC, computation, communication and storage resources are distributed at the network edge, thus are hard to be managed.
To this end, an AI-based automatic resource allocation scheme is designed (as will be explained in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) for the I-UDEC.
Besides, a blockchain based dynamic coordination mechanism (involves resource borrowing and lending) should be considered for the edge servers.
At last, a federated learning based model training method is presented to protect the edge devices’ data privacy.
Blockchain-based service migration is considered to guarantee the security during the migration of services across multiple edge servers.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, the proposed I-UDEC framework is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 The Architecture of I-UDEC ‣ 3 Proposed intelligent ultra-dense edge computing ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
It consists of: i) user plane, ii) data plane and iii) control plane.
The user plane is composed of the edge devices (EDs, such as 5G smart phones and IoT sensors) who have computation offloading requirements, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 The Architecture of I-UDEC ‣ 3 Proposed intelligent ultra-dense edge computing ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
The data plane corresponds to i) remote cloud server, and ii) edge servers deployed close to EDs.
In addition, blockchain-based data plane cache is also applied to i) solve the problem of saturation attacks by caching the missing packets, or ii) deal with the flooding attacks by caching the flood packages.
The control plane is realized by UDN controller deployed at macro base station (MBS).
The control functionalities (i.e., monitoring, computation offloading actions, resource allocation strategies and service caching placement) are centralized at the controller (i.e., the macro base station in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 The Architecture of I-UDEC ‣ 3 Proposed intelligent ultra-dense edge computing ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
Note that blockchain-based network monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is applied in this plane to prevent malicious behaviors (e.g., DDoS attack, packet saturating).
From a global view of the system states, the controller is responsible for collecting and maintaining the lists of EDs’ information, edge server information, service information and application information, so as to optimize the network configurations on demand.
The ED information list includes data such as the computation and communication capacities for each ED.
edge server information list maintains the data of computation, storage and communication capacities, as well as the fronthaul delay for each edge server.
Service information list consists of current service caching placement strategy for the edge servers and EDs.
Application information includes computation offloading requirements, which consists of the application type, required service type, data amount and required CPU cycles.
Typically, an ED reports the edge device information and application information to the nearest serving edge server, when it has computation offloading requirements.
Then, the edge server integrates multiple EDs’ information and edge server information together and transmits to the controller.
The controller receives and trains the data through deep learning and federated learning modules (as will be explained in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Federated Learning-based Model Training ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).
At last, the controller makes i) joint computation offloading and resource allocation decisions for the edge servers and EDs in a fast timescale and ii) service caching placement strategies for the edge servers in a slow timescale.</p>

Note that in the ultra-dense edge computing network, the EDs reserve a part of resource blocks for transmitting pilot signals.
The SCceNB can estimate the uplink channels by comparing the received signals and the pilot signals.
Finally, the SCceNBs send the estimated channels to the controller through via high speed fronthaul links.
In practice, the channel gain can be well estimated (with small random noise).
If the channel state is not perfect estimated, our proposed deep reinforcement learning can actually achieve a very good approximation of the true state due to the powerful learning capability of deep learning over rich experienced learning samples, which can be verified by numerical successful application examples of deep reinforcement learning including intelligent wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we focus on the uplink energy consumption of EDs, and ignore the downlink and computation energy consumption on the SCceNBs side.
On the one hand, for most computation-intensive applications, the data size of outputs sent back in the downlink is much smaller than the data size of inputs in the uplink (the ratio could be as low as 1/30 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>).
On the other hand, the energy consumption of uplink transmission is about 5.5 times as much as that consumed in the downlink reception.
Thus, the energy consumption of downlink reception is much less than that of uplink transmission.
In addition, the SCceNBs are usually deployed in fixed areas with sufficient energy supply.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.26" class="ltx_p">As stated earlier, SCceNBs and EDs have storage space to store data associated with specific computing services.
Service is an abstraction of mobile applications that is managed by servers (i.e., remote cloud, SCceNBs and EDs in this work) and requested by EDs.
Running a particular service (e.g., mobile gaming, virtual reality and Google translator) requires caching the related data (e.g., libraries and databases) on the servers.

Note that the outputs of some sub-tasks are the inputs of others, thus, the dependencies has great influence on the task execution and computation offloading, and can not be ignored.
Generally, there exists three typical dependency models: i) sequential, ii) parallel and iii) general dependency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
Take the task of deep neural network (DNN) model partition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> with sequential dependency as an example.
In order to reduce the burden of edge intelligence applications execution on end devices, DNN model partition can split a DNN training phase (i.e., the computational task <math id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{O}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1.1.cmml">𝒪</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1.1">𝒪</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.10.m10.1c">\mathcal{O}</annotation></semantics></math>) into multiple sub-tasks (i.e., the hidden layers of DNN), as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2.4 Task Model ‣ 3.2 Network Model ‣ 3 Proposed intelligent ultra-dense edge computing ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
By dynamically offloading the resource intensive sub-tasks to the edge server, DNN model partition can speed up the inference process.
In this work, we consider the sequential dependency task model in our framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, the process of computation offloading in the I-UDEC framework consists of the following phases: i) service caching placement, ii) computation offloading decisions and iii) resource allocation.
Firstly, due to the limited storage capabilities of SCcsNBs, an optimal service caching placement strategy for the the SCcsNBs is required to shorten the service distance between EDs and their serving SCcsNBs.
However, unlike the remote cloud which equipped with huge computation and storage resource, an individual SCceNB with limited resource allows only part of the services to be cached at a time.
Thus, the key problems for service caching in I-UDEC are i) how to estimate the popularity of services and cache the popular services, ii) how to balance the tradeoff between multiple services and finite storage capacity of SCceNBs.
Secondly, a fine-grained application partitioning strategy is used to reduce task execution time and improve quality-of-service (QoE) for EDs.
Fine-grained application partitioning divides a mobile application into multiple sub-tasks, and dynamically offloads only the computation-intensive subtasks of the application.
Note that real-time and dynamic partitioning allows mobile devices to obtain the highest benefit through computation offloading, thus plays a critical role in UDEC networks.
At last, SCceNBs need to allocate computation, communication and storage resources to the offloaded subtasks.
After partitioning mobile applications, SCceNB need to allocate available system resources to process the offloaded parts.
Thus, an efficient resource allocation scheme will minimize the system resource usage, and significantly improve the experience of edge devices.
To this end, it makes sense to jointly optimize the service caching placement, application partitioning and resource allocation for the I-UDEC.

In this work, we consider a hybrid computation offloading scenario for the I-UDEC, which means that an ED can either execute sub-tasks locally, or offload computation-intensive sub-tasks to i) another ED through D2D link, ii) a SCceNB through wireless uplink, or iii) remote cloud server through wireless uplink and high speed fronthaul.
Furthermore, we assume that the offloading decision making operates in a time-slot structure, and the decision making period is discrete time frames <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t\in\mathcal{T}=\{0,1,2,...,T\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.3.cmml">∈</mo><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.4" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.4.cmml">𝒯</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.5" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.5.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.4" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.5" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.5" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.5.cmml">T</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2.6" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6"><and id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6a.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6"></and><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6b.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6"><in id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.3"></in><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.4">𝒯</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6c.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6"><eq id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.5"></eq><share href="#S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.4.cmml" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6d.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6"></share><set id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.6.6.2"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3">2</cn><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4">…</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5.5">𝑇</ci></set></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.5c">t\in\mathcal{T}=\{0,1,2,...,T\}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will formulate the optimization problem of joint application partitioning, resource allocation and service caching placement in the I-UDEC framework.
The main objective of the optimization problem is to jointly minimize the tasks’ long-term execution time and system resources’ usage (i.e., computation, communication and storage usage).
To this end, we utilize deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm to tackle the formulated optimization problem, and present a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (<span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span>) approach to train the decision agent, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In reinforcement learning (RL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, an agent can periodically learn to take actions, observes the most reward and automatically adjusts its strategy in order to obtain the optimal policy.
For example, Q-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is a widely used model-free RL algorithm in the literature.
In Q-learning, decision agent can reach to the best policy by estimating the Q-function (be defined as the state-action function).
Q-function utilizes the samples which are obtained during the interactions with the environment to approximate the values of state-action pairs.
However, it is time-consuming for RL to obtain the best policy, since RL must explore and gain knowledge of the whole environment.
Thus, RL is unsuitable and inapplicable to large-scale networks, especially for the ultra dense network environment in the I-UDEC.
Deep learning is introduced as a state-of-the-art technique to tackle the above limitation of RL, and opens a novel research field, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
DRL improves the learning speed and reinforcement learning performance by leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) to train the learning model.</p>

To this end, we present a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to jointly optimize the above issues in two different timescale.
Specifically, we design a two-tier structure deep-Q network (DQN) agent for the DRL, which operates in two different timescales, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.

<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we use Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> to train the agents, owing to its asynchronous advantage.
Under the field of DRL, A3C uses asynchronous multi-threads to train DNN through multiple agents.
The agents are controlled by a global network, can learn and run asynchronously, thus keep their own network parameters and the copies of the environment with different policies.
Each time the agents first update their own parameters of the actor network and the critic network (i.e., the local model in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Reward Function ‣ 4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>), and also a global actor network and a global critic network (i.e., the global model in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Reward Function ‣ 4 Problem Formulation and Algorithm Design ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).
Then, they submit the parameters to the global networks.
At last, the global network receives and distributes the received parameters.
The local and global networks will converge after multiple iterations.
This kind of training has the following advantages:
i) lower memory usage: since the replay memory (e.g., Q-table) of standard DRL is not needed,
ii) avoiding the correlation: since different agents will likely experience different states and transitions
and iii) faster and more robust than the traditional DRL approach.</p>

Several observations can be made.
First, we can find that the total utility for both of the tiers of the <span id="S6.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> is high at the beginning of the DRL process.
The utility decreases when the number of the episodes increases.
Then, tier 1 of the <span id="S6.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> converges faster than the tier 2 of the <span id="S6.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span>, since tier 1 has smaller state and action spaces.</p>

Since resource allocation strategy and service caching placement policy have no impact on the LES, and service caching placement policy has have no impact on the CES.
We compare the performance of our proposed <span id="S6.SS2.p2.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> with the benchmark strategies that is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 6.2 Simulation Results ‣ 6 performance evaluation ‣ When Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Federated Learning: Intelligent Multi-Timescale Resource Management for Multi-access Edge Computing in 5G Ultra Dense Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
Specifically, EES-FRAS-PSCPP refers to an edge execution scheme with fair resource allocation strategy and popularity-based service caching placement policy.
RES-FRAS-PSCPP denotes a random execution scheme with fair resource allocation strategy and popularity-based service caching placement policy.
CES-FRAS represents a cloud execution scheme with fair resource allocation strategy when EDs upload tasks to their nearby SCceNBs.

First of all, our proposal <span id="S6.SS2.p4.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> outperforms the related benchmark policies in term of task execution time.
Note that the LES has stable task execution time when the density grows from 1 to 10, since LES performs local execution, has no additional transmission delay.
The execution time of RES-FRAS-PSCPP, CES-FRAS, EES-FRAS-PSCPP and our proposed <span id="S6.SS2.p4.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> increase when the ED density grows.
Because all the EDs within the same SCceNB coverage share the limited computation and communication resources.
Thus, the performance of the task execution time declines as the number of ED increases.
However, the problem can be solved by deploying more SCceNBs at network edge, especially in some hot-spots areas.
For our <span id="S6.SS2.p4.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span>, the average task execution time increases dramatically when <math id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M&gt;8" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">8</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1"><gt id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1"></gt><ci id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3">8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p4.2.m2.1c">M&gt;8</annotation></semantics></math>.
The reason is that each SCceNB has a limited computation capacity, can serve up to 8 EDs in our simulation.

Several observations can be made.
First of all, PSCPP has a fixed cache hit probability, since all the service have predefine popularity indexes, and PSCPP always cache the most popular services.
Then, the Centralized has a fixed cache hit probability from decision period 0 to 1000 when the decision agent collects the service requests from the EDs.
The decision agent begins to train the model at decision period <math id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t=1000" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">1000</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3">1000</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p5.2.m2.1c">t=1000</annotation></semantics></math>, thus the cache hit probability grows with the number of the episodes increases.
At last, we can find that the cache hit performance of our proposed FL is near close to the results of Centralized.
However, our proposed federated learning-based model training method can protect the data privacy (e.g., most used type of services) for the EDs.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, blockchain, as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, has been adopted in various applications, and attracted much attention.
Note that our proposed I-UDEC still faces some challenges, such as decentralized resource management and security.
Integrating blockchain into I-UDEC is synergistically beneficial for the following reasons.
First, security and privacy are significant challenges to I-UDEC due to the interplay of heterogeneous edge nodes (i.e., SCceNBs and edge devices) and the attack vulnerability of the edge nodes.
In this work, we propose a federated learning-based <span id="S7.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> algorithm for the I-UDEC to guarantee the privacy of edge devices.
Note that the I-UDEC still face the security challenges, such as DDoS attack and packet saturating.
It makes sense to integrate blockchain into I-UDEC, since the integration can i) replace the expensive key management for multiple communication protocols,
ii) enable easy access for the maintenance of the distributed ultra-dense edge SCceNBs of I-UDEC and
iii) provide efficient monitoring in the control plane to prevent malicious behaviors.
Second, in order to tackle the challenge of resource heterogeneity of I-UDEC network, a distributed resource management scheme is required.
It is possible to build a distributed control at massive SCceNBs by leveraging blockchain, since blockchain has the feature of decentralized control.
The resource management involves edge resource borrowing and lending, its pricing based optimization algorithms will play a key role in resource overhead reduction.
Specifically, smart contract of blockchain enables the use of edge resources (i.e., computation, communication and storage resources) on demand.
Because smart contract can automatically run on-demand resource algorithm for the computation offloading requirements.
Last but not least, blockchain systems are hungry for hardware resource (e.g., computing power), and I-UDEC has rich network resources at network edge.
Thus, the deployment of the blockchain in the I-UDEC is mutually beneficial.
The above research directions will be concerned in our future work.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Note that in practical scenarios, SCceNBs in different areas may have different service caching placement state (i.e., service popularity distribution).
As a result, it is hard to aggregates the local models with different shapes through traditional FL.
To this end, we can use personalized federated learning (PFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to capture the characteristics of local service popularity and local offloading requirements.
In PFL, a global model is first trained by standard FL, then, each SCceNB will train a personalized model based on the global model information and its own personal information.
Thus, each SCceNB has a personalized service caching model for different EDs tailored to their computation offloading requirements.
This kind of heterogeneous service caching placement scenario will be studied in our future work.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, a joint computation offloading, resource allocation and service caching placement problem is studied for ultra-dense edge computing networks
First, we introduced an intelligent ultra-dense edge computing (I-UDEC) framework in 5G ultra-dense network environments, in order to formulate the heterogeneous network resources and hybrid computation offloading pattern of UDEC.
Then, in order to minimize the task execution time and network resource usage, we optimize the application partitioning, resource allocation and service caching placement in two different timescale.
To this end, we present a two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (<span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span>) approach to jointly optimize the above issues for the I-UDEC.
The bottom tier of the <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> outputs delay sensitive decisions in a fast timescale, whereas the top tier outputs delay insensitive decision in a slow timescale.
Last but not least, we use a FL-based distributed model training method to train the <span id="S8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> model, in order to protect edge users’ sensitive service request information.
Experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of both the <span id="S8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2Ts-DRL</span> and FL in the I-UDEC framework.</p>
