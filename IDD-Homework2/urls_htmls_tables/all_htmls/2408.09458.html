<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Reversible face anonymization, unlike traditional face pixelization, seeks to replace sensitive identity information in facial images with synthesized alternatives, preserving privacy without sacrificing image clarity. Traditional methods, such as encoder-decoder networks, often result in significant loss of facial details due to their limited learning capacity. Additionally, relying on latent manipulation in pre-trained GANs can lead to changes in ID-irrelevant attributes, adversely affecting data utility due to GAN inversion inaccuracies.
This paper introduces G<sup id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Face, which leverages both generative and geometric priors to enhance identity manipulation, achieving high-quality reversible face anonymization without compromising data utility. We utilize a 3D face model to extract geometric information from the input face, integrating it with a pre-trained GAN-based decoder. This synergy of generative and geometric priors allows the decoder to produce realistic anonymized faces with consistent geometry.
Moreover, multi-scale facial features are extracted from the original face and combined with the decoder using our novel identity-aware feature fusion blocks (IFF). This integration enables precise blending of the generated facial patterns with the original ID-irrelevant features, resulting in accurate identity manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in face anonymization and recovery, while preserving high data utility.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have significantly enhanced everyday convenience, but they have also raised substantial security concerns. This is particularly evident in the widespread sharing of personal facial images on social media, which creates a considerable risk of privacy breaches in case of unauthorized access. To address this, a surge of research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has focused on face anonymization technology, which aims to alter the identity in facial images while preserving other ID-irrelevant attributes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, such as hairstyles, expressions, and background. This technology ensures the privacy of facial images, maintaining their usefulness for various downstream tasks like face detection, tracking, and landmark detection.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Current methods for face anonymization either employ a basic encoder-decoder model for identity modification (a) or modify the latent code using GAN inversion (b), both approaches often resulting in significant loss of facial detail or undesirable changes in ID-irrelevant attributes. Our proposed method intricately combines generative and geometric priors, enhanced by identity guidance, to refine the process of identity modification. This approach enables not only realistic face anonymization but also faithful recovery, all while effectively preserving the utility of the data (c).</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional face anonymization techniques, such as blurring and mosaicing, focus on pixel-level perturbations of facial regions. While effective in obscuring identity, these methods often compromise the clarity of images due to content distortion.
The advent of deep learning, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, has led to the development of GAN-based face anonymization approaches that offer a better balance between identity concealment and image clarity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In practical scenarios, the capacity to reconstruct the original identity from anonymized faces is crucial, especially when individuals agree to share their data only with specific, authorized parties. Addressing this need, several studies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have explored reversible face anonymization techniques. These techniques facilitate the generation of images using both anonymous and real IDs, enabling both the effective removal of identity information from the source image and the precise restoration of the original face from its anonymized version.</p>

Furthermore, many existing techniques do not adequately consider facial geometric constraints, leading to distortions in facial geometry and failure to maintain authentic facial shapes and expressions. This lack of geometric consideration significantly reduces the utility of anonymized faces for downstream tasks like landmark detection and expression recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, we introduce G<sup id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Face, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates generative priors and geometric priors to achieve realistic reversible face anonymization with faithful face shapes, while simultaneously preserving the ID-irrelevant attributes. Our framework is composed of three key modules: the <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Geometry-aware Identity Extraction (GIE)</span> module, the <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Dual Prior-guided Identity Modification (DPIM)</span> module, and the <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Password Extraction (PE)</span> module. In the anonymization process, the GIE module initially selects a random identity embedding and merges it with 3D geometry parameters derived from the input face, creating a geometry-informed identity embedding for target anonymization.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Face anonymization seeks to protect the identity of a face image from being recognized by human observers or computer vision systems, by replacing the original identity with a randomly generated identity.
Recent studies have predominantly leveraged Generative Adversarial Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> (GANs) for face anonymization.
Specifically, DeepPrivacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> obscures the face area and subsequently reconstructs the removed portion using image inpainting techniques, eliminating identity information from the image. CIAGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> masks the face using predicted landmarks and subsequently inpaints the masked area, guided by an alternate identity.
FALCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> drectly optimizes the latent codes of StyleGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, potentially altering identity-irrelevant attributes due to latent space coupling.
IDeudemon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposes an approach employing a “divide and conquer” strategy to safeguard identity and utility incrementally while ensuring strong explainability.
PRO-Face <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and PRO-Face C <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose to obscure the visual features of facial images while maintaining machine recognition capability. However, their methods decrease the utility of the images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, there are also a few efforts to explore reversible anonymization solutions for achieving authenticated access to the original face.
FIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, Pan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and Cao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, RAPP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed to obtain a new identity vector by encrypting the original identity vector with a password and obtain an anonymized image through a generation network, and then decrypt the original identity vector and restore the original image by entering the correct password.
PRO-Face S <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> suggests their flow model can generate a face similar to a pre-obfuscated face by inputting both the original and pre-obfuscated faces, allowing for reversible generation. Their main focus is on recovering anonymized faces, whereas our method enables simultaneous anonymization and recovery.
RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposes a framework of reversible and diversified de-identification with a latent encryptor to generate an anonymized image and recover the original image by a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Although face identity can be altered to some extent, the above methods either suffer from significant facial detail loss due to the inherent limited generation capacity of a simple encoder-decoder architecture or failure to preserve ID-irrelevant attributes caused by inaccurate inversion in pre-trained GAN models. In contrast, our method delicately combines the generative and geometric priors for identity manipulation, leading to realistic face anonymization and recovery with rich facial details and faithful facial shapes without impairing the ID-irrelevant facial attributes.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Generative Prior.</span>
In recent years, models from the Style-GAN series <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images, which give birth to a large number of image editing techniques by leveraging generative priors. StyleGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> enables the generation of diverse images by controlling their style, StyleGAN2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> eliminates the AdaIN operation to effectively diminish artifacts, while StyleGAN3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> further enhances generation details by mapping discrete features into continuous ones. Despite the limited improvements in generation quality from StyleGAN3, considering the trade-off between computational/model complexities and generation performance, we have chosen StyleGAN2 as our facial prior module.
These methods typically utilize GAN inversion for image processing. First, the input image is encoded into the latent space of the StyleGAN to derive a latent code. This code is then manipulated for various image editing applications, such as face swapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, face anonymization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, super-resolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc</span>.
However, a notable drawback of these methods is their infeasibility in finding the precise latent code of the input image, which causes inevitable changes in ID-irrelevant attributes. To tackle this issue, we present an identity-aware feature fusion block that fuses prior features and primitive features with the guidance of identity information. This innovative approach not only enhances the authenticity of the generated faces but also preserves facial attributes that are unrelated to identity, contributing to a more faithful and nuanced anonymization and recovery.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">3D geometric Prior.</span>
Apart from generative priors, 3D geometric facial priors are also widely used for enhancing 3D geometry awareness in face generation. In particular, 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), as a typical representation of the 3D shape and texture of a face image, has demonstrated its efficacy as 3D prior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. For instance, it has proven successful in various face editing tasks such as face swapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, expression and posture transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and face super-resolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
These methods leverage the 3DMM coefficients of identity, expression, and pose as input conditions and guidance for learning a 3D-aware model. Different from the existing methods, we make the first attempt to introduce explicit 3D geometric priors to improve the faithfulness of facial shapes in reversible face anonymization.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of the face attribute editing method is to selectively alter specific semantics of the face based on predefined conditions. Its primary goal is to disentangle the semantic attributes of the face and exclusively modify targeted features without influencing unrelated attributes .
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> propose a framework that obfuscates specific facial attributes while retaining facial identity. In contrast, our approach aims to conceal the identity while preserving ID-irrelevant attributes. PI-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposes a method for perceptual indistinguishability in anonymizing faces by manipulating selected semantic attributes. The PI-Net architecture generates realistic faces while preserving these chosen attributes. A3GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> presents an attribute-aware anonymization network that treats face anonymization as a dual task involving semantic suppression and controllable attribute manipulation. While this method eliminates identity information, it also alters ID-irrelevant attributes, thereby leading to severe loss of data utility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, diffusion model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> has exhibited remarkable capabilities in the realm of generative model, particularly in face generation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, most efforts in this domain have focused on personalized ID generation, employing a global image generation process that lacks fine-grained control over various facial attributes. Due to this, diffusion-based methods struggle with accurate ID manipulation while preserving ID-irrelevant attributes. Moreover, the training and inference costs of diffusion models are higher than those of GANs, posing challenges to real-time applications. Therefore, we adopt GANs as the foundation for our framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current methods predominantly rely on “creating” a dummy face to achieve face anonymization. However, they rarely consider keeping the geometric consistency (<span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, face shape, expression, and pose) between the anonymized face and the original face, thereby significantly undermining the data utility of the anonymized faces in downstream applications, such as landmark detection and expression recognition.
To circumvent this issue, we propose to incorporate explicit guidance into the anonymization process to ensure the geometric consistency between the anonymized face and the original face. Concretely, we introduce the 3D morphable model (3DMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to provide geometric priors for synthesizing geometric-consistent and faithful anonymized images. This is the key to ensuring the data utility of face anonymization for downstream tasks.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">For face anonymization, prior works typically learn a simple identity manipulation mapping by an encoder-decoder architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or solely rely on manipulating the latent code via GAN inversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the former often tend to produce low-quality results with notable facial detail loss due to the limited generation capacity of their networks.
Although the latter explore GAN priors to achieve face anonymization with higher fidelity, they struggle with maintaining the original ID-irrelevant attributes due to the inherent inaccuracies and uncontrollability in the GAN inversion and manipulation process, thus heavily impairing the utility of anonymized faces.
To enable realistic face anonymization with data utility well preserved, we devise a dual prior-guided identity manipulation module (DPIM) that explicitly introduces generative and geometric priors to render vivid facial patterns for anonymization, while precisely retaining the original ID-irrelevant features simultaneously.
Specifically, the DPIM comprises an identity manipulation network <math id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">G</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐺</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">G</annotation></semantics></math>, a face encoder <math id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E_{face}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">E</mi><mrow id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">f</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1b" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5.cmml">e</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐸</ci><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">𝑓</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">𝑎</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5">𝑒</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">E_{face}</annotation></semantics></math>, and a series of identity-aware feature fusion blocks (IFFs),

The results show that the adaptive mask indeed effectively captures the ID-irrelevant regions, particularly encompassing background and hairstyle regions. Simultaneously, the generative model generates anonymized key attributes related to ID-relevant facial characteristics. Our proposed adaptive feature fusion block adeptly merges these two features, leading to a visually compelling anonymized image with preserved ID-irrelevant attributes.</p>

In contrast, our method not only generates realistic anonymized faces with faithful facial details and shapes but also perfectly preserves the original id-irrelevant attributes (Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Anonymization Comparison with SOTA Methods ‣ IV Experiments ‣ G2Face: High-Fidelity Reversible Face Anonymization via Generative and Geometric Priors Manuscript received at 15 January 2024; revised at 8 April 2024 and 12 June 2024; accepted at 15 August 2024.

This is mainly attributed to our delicate exploitation of generative and geometric priors with precise identity awareness.
It is also worth noting that, our method can perform satisfactory face anonymization even when the input face contains heavy occlusions compared with other methods (the fifth row of Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Anonymization Comparison with SOTA Methods ‣ IV Experiments ‣ G2Face: High-Fidelity Reversible Face Anonymization via Generative and Geometric Priors Manuscript received at 15 January 2024; revised at 8 April 2024 and 12 June 2024; accepted at 15 August 2024.

Here, following the same setting as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, we choose the true acceptance rate: the ratio of true positives for a maximum 0.001 ratio of false positives, as our metric. In our approach, we anonymize the second face image within each positive pair from the LFW dataset. We then evaluate the true acceptance rate of all pairs using two FaceNet models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, trained on VGGFace2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and CASIA-WebFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, as well as ArcFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, trained on MS1MV3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, and AdaFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, trained on WebFace12M <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, for face recognition assessment.

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For a more comprehensive comparison, we also conduct a quantitative evaluation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Since there is no paired identity label in CelebA-HQ, we apply our anonymization technique to each sample in the testing set and calculate the cosine similarity between the identity embeddings of the original faces and the anonymized faces. To ensure a convincing comparison, we adopt three different models for identity embedding extraction, including the FaceNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> trained on VGGFace2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, the ArcFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> trained on MS1MV3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, and the AdaFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> trained on WebFace12M <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, respectively.

Apart from face anonymization, it is also crucial for a model to maintain the data utility of the anonymized face images.
To evaluate the utility maintenance capability of different methods, we choose different metrics for evaluating utility for different downstream tasks, including face detection, bounding box detection, landmark detection, face shape estimation, expression recognition, and pose estimation.
Concretely, we measure the utility of generated anonymized faces by using three 2D and three 3D face image metrics for a comprehensive evaluation.
For the 2D face metrics, we employ two face detection libraries, MTCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> and Dlib <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, to evaluate the face detection rate, bounding box distance, and landmark distance between the original and anonymized faces.
In terms of the 3D face metrics, we use two 3D face reconstruction models, DCEA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> and D3DFR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, to calculate the distance of the shape embeddings and expression embeddings between the original and anonymized faces.
Additionally, we adopt two head pose estimation models, HOPENet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> and FSANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, to compute the pose distance of the original and anonymized faces.
Here, we choose the L2 distance metric for all the above distance calculations.
Moreover, we also involve the image fidelity metric by comparing the Fr<math id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{\acute{e}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">e</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">´</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1">´</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">e</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">\mathrm{\acute{e}}</annotation></semantics></math>chet Inception Distance (FID) scores <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> of the generated results among different methods.</p>

For the face detection rate, our method also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods such as RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and FALCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Considering all the above, our method can not only perform face anonymization precisely but also excellently maintain the utility for downstream tasks, demonstrating its huge potential in real-world applications.</p>

Before executing reversible recovery, we validate the accuracy of the extracted identity password. Only upon confirming the correctness of the extracted password can we proceed with identity recovery effectively. Our assessment involves computing the bit error rate and mean squared error (MSE) when converting binary to floating-point numbers on the CelebA-HQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> dataset, as presented in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-B Anonymization Comparison with SOTA Methods ‣ IV Experiments ‣ G2Face: High-Fidelity Reversible Face Anonymization via Generative and Geometric Priors Manuscript received at 15 January 2024; revised at 8 April 2024 and 12 June 2024; accepted at 15 August 2024.

From the results, it’s evident that our approach accurately extracts the embedded binary password and converts it into valid identity information for seamless recovery. Notably, our method does not prioritize information steganography, hence we did not delve into evaluating the performance of password steganography further.</p>

We can observe that although FIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> can recover the original identity, it undergoes significant facial details loss and noticeable complexion changes. RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is capable of generating vivid facial patterns but struggles to recover the original face due to its GAN inversion-based scheme.
In comparison, our method can perfectly reconstruct the original face with vivid and faithful facial details.</p>

Moreover, it is also worth noting that our method elaborately embeds the password embedding into the anonymized face without compromising the anonymization/recovery quality, thereby evading the need for a troublesome pre-defined password for recovery that is required by both FIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This feature grants our method better scalability and makes it more practical and convenient for real-world applications.</p>

As is observed, the identities generated by CIAGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and FIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> distribute in a relatively small area for each cluster, indicating that the anonymized images generated by these two methods exhibit low diversity.
In comparison, RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> generates more distributed identity embeddings. The rationale behind this is that RiDDLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> relies on the GAN inversion to generate anonymized images, which tends to manipulate the identity information with significant changes on the other id-irrelevant attributes of the input face. This results in a higher diversity of the generated anonymized images at the cost of severe deterioration in the utility of the anonymized images.
Unlike all the above methods, our approach not only generates more distributed identities but also tends to cluster in proximity when the embeddings are derived from the same source. This indicates that our method can generate diverse anonymized faces while simultaneously preserving the geometric consistency with the original face, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both face anonymization and utility maintenance.</p>

Particularly, we investigate the performance of different model variants by all combinations of different components, respectively. Here, we include six metrics for quantitative evaluation: the cosine similarities between the identity embeddings of the anonymized face and the original face (Ano.), and between the identity embeddings of the recovered face and the original face (Rec.) are calculated for measuring face anonymization/recovery performance. Additionally, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, distances of landmarks (LM.), shape (Shape), and expressions (Exp.) are also involved in evaluating image quality and data utility maintenance, respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present G<sup id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Face, a novel framework for achieving high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reversible face anonymization.
The proposed G<sup id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Face framework explicitly extracts the 3D information as geometric prior, which is then combined with the generative priors in a pre-trained StyleGAN in a multi-scale manner via a set of elaborately designed identity-aware feature fusion blocks. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art competitions in reversible face recovery with high data utility.</p>
