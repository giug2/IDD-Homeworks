<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) systems face performance challenges in dealing with heterogeneous devices and non-identically distributed data across clients. We propose a dynamic global model aggregation method within Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) deployments to address these issues. Our aggregation method scores and adjusts the weighting of client model updates based on their upload frequency to accommodate differences in device capabilities. Additionally, we also immediately provide an updated global model to clients after they upload their local models to reduce idle time and improve training efficiency. We evaluate our approach within an AFL deployment consisting of 10 simulated clients with heterogeneous compute constraints and non-IID data. The simulation results, using the FashionMNIST dataset, demonstrate over 10% and 19% improvement in global model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods PAPAYA and FedAsync, respectively. Our dynamic aggregation method allows reliable global model training despite limiting client resources and statistical data heterogeneity. This improves robustness and scalability for real-world FL deployments.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative Machine Learning (ML) method, which aims to meet the significant challenges of (user) data privacy and the large number of devices. FL was first proposed by Google/Alphabet in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In traditional ML paradigms, datasets are centralised in a single location for processing and learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Whereas, with an FL framework, data is distributed on different devices and no longer needs to be collected centrally. Each participating device (also known as a <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">”client”</span>) will train the model independently using their local data. Once a training round is complete (usually involving several learning iterations), the client sends the gradient or parameter update of the model to a central aggregation node, known as the <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">”parameter server”</span> (PS). The task of the PS is to aggregate the updates sent by all the involved clients, form a new global model, and broadcast the new global model back to each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. FL framework ensures that user data never leaves the original device, and only model parameters are shared centrally, thus protecting user privacy to a certain extent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practical FL implementations, participating client devices exhibit heterogeneity in hardware capabilities, including communication link quality, bandwidth availability, local memory capacity, processing speed, and power constraints. In addition, given the nature of distributed devices and sensors in an FL network, the data held by participating FL devices typically follows a non-Independent and Identically Distribution (non-IID)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Often these differences in hardware performance and training data distribution lead to a critical problem in real-world FL applications: how can we process the time difference in completing a round of FL training between different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In the synchronised version of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, more efficient (in terms of computational capacity) devices are often forced to wait after completing their local training tasks. This can be mainly attributed to the FL devices with inferior hardware capabilities or those with larger local datasets requiring substantial computing resources to complete client-side training procedures. Only after these devices have successfully shared their locally trained models with the parameter server can the more efficient devices proceed with the subsequent round of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This means that the efficiency of the entire system can be negatively impacted by the worst-performing client, resulting in a large number of computing resources being wasted/idling unnecessarily <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The distribution of non-IID data can also impede global model convergence during collaborative training as each client model drifts towards disparate local optima <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Existing mitigation techniques such as aggregation after receiving a pre-set minimum number of local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> carry inherent limitations; slower-updating edge devices face exclusion from contributions to the global model aggregation regardless of representativeness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the problems of delay and resource utilisation in such traditional FL settings, Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) was proposed (illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In this, the parameter server no longer waits for all devices or edge nodes to complete their respective training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> prior to broadcasting a global model. Once the device completes training of its local model, it is shared with the parameter server. The server then immediately starts aggregating the new local model with the existing global model and sends the updated global model back to the device so that the device can continue the next round of training. This aggregation process also usually involves combining models from different devices. In most cases, these models are given equal weighting (when averaged) to generate a new global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The advantage of this method lies in the high tolerance towards devices with different hardware capabilities and data distribution. Especially in the case of significant differences in device resources, the AFL strategy ensures that devices with superior computing performance will not waste time waiting, thus avoiding a large number of computing resources in the idle state <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Since, each FL device can train a model and upload it independently, the communication or waiting with other devices is significantly reduced. This method has significant advantages in communication efficiency, especially in those scenarios with high network delay or unstable network connection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While AFL addresses challenges related to the operational functionality of FL deployments, the global model remains susceptible to bias from hardware heterogeneity and non-IID data distributions. Consequently, devices updating the global model more frequently may dominate aggregation, creating a skew that disadvantages resource-constrained edge devices with infrequent updates. Additionally, if not appropriately weighted for recency, stale model updates can disrupt representation. Similarly, non-IID data partitioning and class imbalance can lead to the training of disparate edge models. Naively aggregating these models may hinder convergence, resulting in suboptimal global model performance. Therefore, intelligent coordination in AFL aggregation is essential to ensure robustness against device and data heterogeneity, preventing compromised global model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces an enhanced AFL model aggregation method that evaluates and adjusts global model aggregation based on client upload frequency. Furthermore, it actively reduces client idling time between FL aggregation rounds by providing clients with the latest global model for training. During the FL client upload phase, a buffer layer is implemented, incorporating an aggregation scaling factor to quantify communication frequency with the server. It calculates the difference between the client model being uploaded and the global model. Dynamic parameters within the layer are configured to optimise the induced model staleness bias. Consequently, our method can train a reliable global model even when faced with limitations in the computing power of an FL client or the uneven distribution of local client training data, addressing both data volume and class imbalance.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the potential bias in AFL environments, the FedAsync algorithm, proposed by Xie <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, introduces a dynamic hybrid hyperparameter based on an outdated model. For example, when the current global model has been updated for a few rounds of aggregation and a new client has completed the first delayed local update, outdated or non-obsolete models will be queued in chronological order. The PS controls the proportion of local models when aggregating with the global model through obsolescence functions. Consequently, local models with a large degree of ‘staleness’ will have a small weighting in the global model update. This algorithm directly reduces the impact of the stale/laggard model on the accuracy of the global model. However, these models may still contain some valuable information that could help to improve the accuracy of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Huba <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>’s Papaya algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> implements the FedBuffer algorithm proposed by Nguyen <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In this, after a client completes its local training, the updated local model is uploaded to the buffer layer memory first. When the buffer layer reaches the aggregation target (i.e., a pre-set number of client models), the global model is aggregated and updated to the clients. This can effectively reduce the gap between the laggard and the faster clients, but the computing resources of some powerful devices are still not optimally utilised because these clients still need to wait for the weaker devices in the buffer layer to complete the training and enter the idle state.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed framework for mitigating system bias, as introduced earlier, follows the asynchronous FL setup. A system overview diagram is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II Related Work ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates some example training rounds of our method. When the buffer layer at the PS receives a new local model from the participating FL client devices, and the buffer layer does not meet the aggregation target (i.e., the minimum number of client models in the buffer layer, prior to triggering a global model aggregation task), it immediately shares the current global model with the client device to continue the training task. Upon reaching the aggregation target, the buffer layer promptly aggregates the new global model, replacing the previous global model. This ensures the maintenance of a unique global model throughout the FL training process</p>

Upon the receipt of the local model at the PS, we evaluate the obsolescence/staleness of the current model based on the disparity between its and the latest global model’s timestamps – greater disparities signify a ”stale” local client model. Moreover, when added to the buffer, stale models are assigned a smaller scaling factor for aggregation. In the case of different local models from the same client being received before reaching the aggregation target in the buffer, a smaller scaling factor will be assigned to the particular high frequency client.
This adjustment aims to prevent performance skewness towards resource-efficient clients, which could otherwise lead to an underrepresented global model.
When the aggregation target is reached, we aggregate the sum of the scaled local models currently stored in the buffer as a new global aggregation model.

We distribute this training data in both IID and non-IID setups across the local datasets of 10 simulated FL clients and then quantify model performance aggregated from their intermittent updates.
We compare our dynamic, latency-adjusted aggregation scheme against two state-of-the-art approaches, as introduced in Section <a href="#S2" title="II Related Work ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>: FedAsync <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Papaya <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to assess the most salient bias in AFL (considering the FedAsync method) and its impact on the overall accuracy of the global model. We designed an experimental setup consisting of 10 FL clients (summarised in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>). To mimic hardware disparities, half of the clients were deliberately subjected to resource limitations by introducing delays in their updates. Additionally, we investigated the consequences of data distortion or class imbalance of local client training datasets by varying the number of classes (out of a total of 10) for each client during local training. Finally, an IID experiment, where classes and training data volumes were uniform across all FL clients, was also conducted to illustrate the “accuracy cost” associated with such modifications. The hyperparameters used for all simulated AFL experiments are consistent and detailed in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, it is evident that, in Experiment 1.1, the heterogeneous training devices based on IID data achieve the highest global model accuracy.
Experiment 1.2 represents computationally resource constrained clients training with access to all 10 classes of the FashionMNIST dataset and the computationally efficient clients training with only 3 classes can achieve almost similar results as the IID setting.
However, in the reversed scenario (Experiment 1.3), where weaker clients’ training is based on all 10 classes and stronger clients train on only 3 classes, this results in the worst performance in terms of classification accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Experiment 1.4 used the Dirichlet distribution setting, wherein each client was assigned on average 4 or 5 classes of training data (out of a possible 10). This choice was made to emulate a more practical and diverse FL setup, ensuring that no single client had access to the full set of classes to train with. Across these four different experimental settings, it is evident that more powerful clients exert a dominant influence on the training process, and variations in computing resources and training data do introduce bias in the global model. Performance deterioration is particularly noteworthy in scenarios where resource constrained clients have access to the majority classes of the dataset. This can be attributed to the fact that slower clients, with a reduced update frequency, have a lesser contribution to the global model which is heavily biased towards clients with the most amount of updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We next evaluated our proposed method targeting mitigation against such bias and compared its performance with two state-of-the-art AFL methods in PAPAYA and FedAsync.
Global model accuracy for each during AFL training is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V Results ‣ Mitigating System Bias in Resource Constrained Asynchronous Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we conducted multiple experiments based on an Asynchronous FL environment to evaluate the biases caused by FL device hardware heterogeneity and non-IID client data distributions.
High-performance devices in these settings quickly train and update models in asynchronous environments, while resource constrained devices may delay submitting their updates. This mismatch can lead to under-consideration of updates for some devices when aggregating global models at the PS, as they are relatively outdated/stale compared to the updated global model state. In addition, network latency and interruptions may also lead to the loss or delay of certain device updates, which poses a threat to the stability and convergence of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, data heterogeneity also negatively impacts performance in such FL applications. The training data stored in the FL client device may vary significantly due to geographical location, user behaviour habits, or other factors. This means that the data of certain devices may not represent the overall data distribution (of all FL clients), or some key subsets of data may only exist on a few devices. Such data distribution may lead to excessive optimisation of the local model on specific tasks or subsets of data, thereby compromising the global ability to generalise to new data or different devices. In terms of data volume, some devices may have rich data (lots of classes, large volume), while others may have relatively few. This imbalance, without proper processing, can cause data-rich devices to have an overwhelming impact on the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we show through extensive experimentation that such bias, caused by hardware and data heterogeneity, in AFL, cannot be completely eliminated but can be appropriately reduced. We have proposed a new aggregation method to reduce the impact of such bias on the global model performance. Our method has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively improve the global model accuracy in AFL environments when compared with other state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For future work, we aim to cover other datasets and different model architectures to evaluate the robustness of our method. Moving forward, promising avenues exist to expand the evaluation of our aggregation technique across even more heterogeneous AFL system deployments. Additional dimensions of hardware diversity could entail sampling various device computation, memory, and power constraints. On the model representation side, assessing performance under conditions of quantisation or pruned neural networks tailored to match the resource limitations of local devices would prove highly valuable. Developing robust, adaptive AFL aggregation schemes capable of harmonising diverse hardware configurations, statistical data divergences, and specialised local model representations remains an open challenge of great practical interest.</p>
