<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies the poisoning attack and defense interactions in a federated learning (FL) system, specifically in the context of wireless signal classification using deep learning for next-generation (NextG) communications. FL collectively trains a global model without the need for clients to exchange their data samples. By leveraging geographically dispersed clients, the trained global model can be used for incumbent user identification, facilitating spectrum sharing. However, in this distributed learning system, the presence of malicious clients introduces the risk of poisoning the training data to manipulate the global model through falsified local model exchanges. To address this challenge, a proactive defense mechanism is employed in this paper to make informed decisions regarding the admission or rejection of clients participating in FL systems. Consequently, the attack-defense interactions are modeled as a game, centered around the underlying admission and poisoning decisions. First, performance bounds are established, encompassing the best and worst strategies for attackers and defenders. Subsequently, the attack and defense utilities are characterized within the Nash equilibrium, where no player can unilaterally improve its performance given the fixed strategies of others. The results offer insights into novel operational modes that safeguard FL systems against poisoning attacks by quantifying the performance of both attacks and defenses in the context of NextG communications.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Next-generation (NextG)</em> communications are anticipated to revolutionize various applications such as smart warehouses, vehicle-to-vehicle networks, and virtual and augmented reality, offering improved throughput, low latency, and enhanced quality of experience (QoE). However, simplistic analytical models based on expert knowledge struggle to capture the intricate nature of waveforms, channels, and resources in NextG communications. To address this challenge, <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">machine learning</em> (ML) emerges as a promising approach, enabling learning and adaptation to dynamic spectrum conditions. In particular, <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">deep learning</em> (DL) techniques exhibit exceptional capabilities in capturing the high-dimensional data characteristics of wireless communications, surpassing traditional ML methods for detection, classification, and prediction tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DL-based wireless signal classifiers are effective for incumbent user detection, which is crucial for enabling dynamic spectrum sharing in NextG communication systems with incumbent users. One pertinent use case in the tactical domain involves spectrum co-existence between NextG communication systems and tactical radars, such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band. DL also finds applications in physical layer authentication of user equipment in NextG communications. To address the challenges of data collection from diverse edge devices, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) offers a solution by enabling a collaborative system where clients train a single ML/DL model without sharing their individual training datasets. Instead, they share only the model parameters with the server (e.g., base station), which processes the information and disseminates a global model. This approach not only ensures privacy but also reduces communication load, as the trained models are typically much smaller than the original training data. Moreover, edge devices with limited resources can still participate in collaborative training by using their own capabilities. These capabilities make FL ideal for the collaborative training with multiple sensors in a variety of applications including navigation, autonomy, environment monitoring, and communications systems. To that end, the use of FL over a wireless network should take into account the unique characteristics of wireless communications, ensuring effective training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As DL becomes a core part of NextG systems, there is an increasing concern about the vulnerability of DL to various exploits, attacks, and non-cooperative behaviors. On one hand, clients may be selfish to participate in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> by receiving the global model but not returning their trained local models. FL may be also subject to conventional jamming attacks to disrupt communications (model exchanges) between the clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In addition, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adversarial machine learning</em> (AML) equips smart adversaries with novel means to tamper with the training and/or test inputs to DL algorithms for NextG communications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The inherent openness and shared nature of the wireless medium make NextG communication systems highly susceptible to threats from adversaries such as eavesdroppers and jammers. These malicious actors have the capability to observe and manipulate the training and test inputs transmitted over the air. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand the attack surface concerning AML attacks targeting the data and control planes of wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

In such attacks, a malicious participant injects false or deceptive data into the model, leading to biased or inaccurate results. This compromise can have adverse effects on the global model in FL, causing incorrect decisions to occur. The vulnerabilities of wireless systems to poisoning attacks have been studied for spectrum access <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, cooperative spectrum sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and internet of things <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we adopt a proactive <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">defense</em> approach that focuses on selecting clients for admission into the FL process. The effectiveness of this defense lies in potentially rejecting the poisoned clients while admitting those that are unpoisoned. By increasing the number of unpoisoned clients admitted and minimizing the inclusion of poisoned clients, the accuracy of the system improves. In order to enhance resilience, it is essential to effectively address the conflicting interactions between the attack and the defense in an analytical framework. <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Game theory</em> provides a mathematical foundation for quantifying the payoffs associated with these interactions, making it a suitable tool for modeling both conventional attacks, such as jamming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and AML attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we formalize the interactions between the attack and the defense as a <em id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-cooperative game</em> and quantify the vulnerability and resilience of FL for NextG signal classification with respect to poisoning attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The game involves the selection of actions by the attack, namely which clients to poison, and by the defense, namely which clients to admit for FL. The defense aims to maximize the payoff referred to as the utility of resilient operation, which is based on the classification accuracy while considering the cost associated with admitting clients to FL, including computational and communication expenses. Meanwhile, the attack seeks to maximize another payoff, which is the classification error minus the cost incurred when launching the attack, encompassing activities such as eavesdropping, computing, and jamming. We identify the <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Nash Equilibrium</em> strategies as resilient modes of operation, where neither the attack nor the defense can unilaterally change their strategy to improve their payoff given the fixed strategy of the opponent. For this game, we derive equilibrium payoffs as functions of the classification accuracy and costs for both the attack and the defense.</p>

Each device possesses access to local spectrum data samples. These devices collect spectrum measurements within their respective environments, characterized by varying channel conditions. The collected data is then utilized to train a local model on each device, which is subsequently transmitted to a central server. The central server undertakes the task of aggregating the local models and generating a global model. This global model is then disseminated back to the edge devices for further collaborative training, enabling the joint detection and classification of wireless signals.

Each client trains its model and sends its parameters to the server. The server processes all local models and broadcasts the global model updates to clients. There is an attacker which selects whether to attack and/or which client(s) to attack. The server decides which clients to accept or reject as a defense method. We formulate the attack and the defense as a non-cooperative game.

The clients are more declined to participate in FL (i.e., they do not contribute to the global model) with the increasing defense cost. Thus, the defense probability
decreases. This triggers more attacks to increase the impact of the attack. As a result, the attack utility does not decrease with the increasing cost.</p>

In response, the attack utility increases. As we increase the attack and defense cost, the attack utility decreases as it becomes more costly to attack.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We considered the poisoning attack on FL systems for wireless signal classification in NextG communications and analyzed the attack-defense interactions in a game setting to characterize resilient operation modes for FL. In the poisoning attack, training data of any client may be poisoned to mislead the training process for the global model. The defense may select between admitting or rejecting clients with the ultimate goal of eliminating poisoned clients. We formulated a non-cooperative game played between the attacker and the defender to quantify the performance due to the conflicting interests. After deriving the attack and defense performance bounds, we determined the attack and defense strategies and utilities in Nash equilibrium for two clients and extended the analysis to an arbitrary number of clients. This analysis has led to novel resilient operation modes identifying how to protect FL against poisoning attacks in NextG communication systems.</p>
