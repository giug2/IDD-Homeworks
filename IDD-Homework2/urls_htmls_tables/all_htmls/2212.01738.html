<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been ubiquitously adopted in internet of things and are becoming an integral of our daily life. When tackling the evolving learning tasks in real world, such as classifying different types of objects, DNNs face the challenge to continually retrain themselves according to the tasks on different edge devices. Federated continual learning is a promising technique that offers partial solutions but yet to overcome the following difficulties: the significant accuracy loss due to the limited on-device processing, the negative knowledge transfer caused by the limited communication of non-IID data, and the limited scalability on the tasks and edge devices. In this paper, we propose FedKNOW, an accurate and scalable federated continual learning framework, via a novel concept of signature task knowledge.
<span id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">FedKNOW is a client side solution that continuously extracts and integrates the knowledge of signature tasks which are highly influenced by the current task. Each client of FedKNOW is composed of a knowledge extractor, a gradient restorer and, most importantly, a gradient integrator. Upon training for a new task, the gradient integrator ensures the prevention of <em id="id4.id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">catastrophic forgetting</em> and mitigation of <em id="id4.id1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">negative knowledge transfer</em> by effectively combining signature tasks identified from the past local tasks and other clients’ current tasks through the global model.</span>
We implement FedKNOW in PyTorch and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques using popular federated continual learning benchmarks. Extensive evaluation results on heterogeneous edge devices show that FedKNOW improves model accuracy by 63.24% without increasing model training time, reduces communication cost by 34.28%, and achieves more improvements under difficult scenarios such as large numbers of tasks or clients, and training different complex networks.</p>

At the same time, the arising new challenge is that the environment continuously evolves, requiring the DNN models to retrain and adapt to those changes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated continual learning (FCL)</span>. Continual learning is a prevalent technique that incrementally learns deep models from such a non-stationary data consisting of different tasks. Traditional continual learning only learns its models from the training samples on their hosted devices. In contrast, humans can learn from their own and others’ past experiences through conversations, lectures, books and other means.
Motivated by the intuition of learning from other clients’ (indirect) experience, FCL combines continual learning in the federated learning framework such that the model in a client can continuously learn from its local data and the knowledge of the tasks in other clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>.
As shown in the exemplary scenario of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61872337, 62132019, 62272046) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2020MF034).

This allows each client to perform continual learning of its task sequence based on its local data, while learning from other clients by communicating their task-specific weights via the server.
<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">One major problem of performing continual learning in a client is <span id="S1.p2.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">catastrophic forgetting</span>: when its model learns new tasks over time, it may forget previously learned task information and the model accuracy in these tasks degrades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
The challenge of coping with evolving task is further exacerbated when training DNN models according to evolving tasks on a large number of clients.
In FCL, each client has its private sequence of tasks. Even for the same task, different clients host <em id="S1.p2.1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-IID datasets</em> whose distributions of classes, input data features, and numbers of samples vary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. This means although starting from the same global model, these clients have diverse models after local training. When aggregating a client¡¯s model with those of other clients, the model divergence may decrease the accuracy in local tasks, know as <span id="S1.p2.1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">negative knowledge transfer</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges of FCL at edge</span>. <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Edge computing is developed to reduce communication costs to cloud servers and enhance data privacy via on-device data processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
Performing FCL at edge brings new problems such that the computation and communication costs in model training increase with the number of tasks and client, and conducting such expensive training on resource-constrained edge devices give rise to two technical challenges.
</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Limited computational resources lead to significant accuracy losses</em>. Existing continual learning and FCL techniques are server-side solutions, which designed for powerful cloud servers and retain training samples or model weights of previous tasks from all clients to avoid catastrophic forgetting  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. This means the learning process becomes longer when the number of tasks increases. For example, the training time of a ResNet-18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> increases by 50 times when the number of tasks increases from 1 to 80.
When encountering resource constraints, these techniques can only retain a portion of samples and may incur large accuracy losses (20% to 50% losses) because most of important information in previous tasks is dropped.
The <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">first challenge</span>, therefore, is to design a lightweight learning method that can keep extensive historical knowledge and take short model training time directly on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Preventing negative knowledge transfer causes high communication costs and privacy leakage</em>.
Existing techniques rely on the central server which collects and keeps all clients’ task models to prevent negative knowledge transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>.
This mechanism causes high communication costs because: (i) the knowledge’s size increases linearly with the number of clients; and (ii) all clients need to synchronize other clients’ latest knowledge once any new task arrives.
For instance, the communication traffic of FedWEIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> is eight times larger than that of the basic federate learning method when the client number is just 20.
<span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Maintaining the global knowledge among multiple clients also violates scalability and privacy enforcement of edge computing.
The <span id="S1.p5.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">second challenge</span> is how to develop a distributed method that can prevent negative knowledge transfer without increasing extra communications among clients.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this paper, we depart from computationally and communication intensive FCL server-side approaches and propose FedKNOW, a lightweight client-side solution that integrates knowledge of signature tasks which encompass the relevant past and peer tasks.
FedKNOW acts in each client and extracts compact and transferable knowledge (instead of data) – the critical subset of model weights.
When learning a new task, FedKNOW integrates it with the knowledge of its <span id="S1.p6.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">signature tasks</span>, which are the new task’s most dissimilar tasks identified from local past tasks to prevent <em id="S1.p6.1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">catastrophic forgetting</em>, and the updated global model representing other clients’ current tasks in preventing <em id="S1.p6.1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">negative knowledge transfer</em>.
By completing knowledge integration with polynomial time complexity, FedKNOW addresses the limitations of existing techniques by providing both high model accuracy and low communication overhead at edge.</span> In particular, the contributions of this paper are as follows:</p>

FedKNOW extracts and retains each task’s <em id="S1.p7.1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">knowledge</em> as a small proportion (e.g. 10%) of model weights with the highest degree of activation to the task.</span></p>

Both integrations guarantee the acute angle between the integrated gradient and all other gradients. This gradient is then used in model updating to prevent catastrophic forgetting and negative knowledge transfer.</span></p>

We extensively compare FedKNOW to the 11 state-of-the-art techniques, and find that it increases model accuracy by 63.24% using similar or less model training time, for extremely challenging scenarios of 80 tasks or 100 clients. Compared to standard continual learning that uses all the data sample, FedKNOW achieves higher accuracy because of effective avoidance of negative knowledge transfer.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated learning</span> trains a global model using private data from multiple clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In a client’s model training, negative transfer from other clients (due to their Non-IID datasets) is a crucial problem that delays training convergency and degrades model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
<em id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Personalized federated learning</em> is a major technique used to mitigate such negative transfer and it can be divided into four types: (1) Mixture model techniques such as adaptive personalized federated learning (APFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> dynamically change the ratio of global and local models in training.
(2) In local fine-tuning techniques, each client first accepts a global model, and then updates it using local data. Meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is increasingly employed to complete the update within a few iterations.
(3) Contextualization aims to provide a different model for each context, e.g., character’s context  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
(4) Multi-task learning lets each client train a separate task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> and further classifies clients into different groups according to their tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Note that the last two types of techniques cannot be directly applied in continual learning, because they compound learning new tasks with contexts and multi-task learning.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FCL</span>. Some initial technique proposes server-side solution that maintains some training samples in the server and uses them in global model updating to avoid catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>. The effectiveness of this work depends on the amounts of maintained samples and it is impractical to share clients’ local data in the server due to data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
The latest FCL technique, FedWEIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> uses adaptive model weights to maintain previous tasks’ knowledge in a client and retains all clients’ adaptive weights in the central server. Whenever a client needs to learn a new task, it first obtains the server’s adaptive weights and then uses them in model training to prevent both catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer. The main limitation of FedWEIT is the scalability with respect to the number of clients and tasks due to their communication overhead.</p>

The extraction process utilizes the weight-based pruning technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to remove most of the model weights whose absolute values are lower than a given threshold and retain the remaining ones (e.g. 10%) as the signature task knowledge.

Three federated learning baselines take less time to converge because these methods donot consider previous task information in model training, hence their model accuracies are lower than most of the other techniques due to catastrophic forgetting.
This also explains the results that when the number of task increases, the accuracies of all techniques decrease. FedKNOW suffers least from the accuracy depredation because when learning a new task, it integrates its knowledge with the seen tasks that are most dissimilar from the current task model. In contrast, FedWEIT uses the maintained knowledge of all tasks (stored at the server) and may lower the influence of important tasks.

In a federated learning environment, the non-IID datasets in different clients also considerably influence model accuracy. The five continual learning baselines well address catastrophic forgetting, but suffer from negative knowledge transfer from other clients. For example, AGS-CL’s loss function considers the changes in model weights. Hence the large changes in global model weights cause non-convergence in CORe50, MiniImageNet, and TinyImageNet datasets, and this observation is no observed in Figures <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Comparative Evaluations under Different FCL Scenarios ‣ V Evaluation ‣ FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61872337, 62132019, 62272046) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2020MF034).

We extend the above evaluation by adding 10 CPU-based devices (Raspberry Pi 4B) to the cluster with 20 Jetson devices. The Raspberry Pi devices consist of one with 2 GB memory, five ones with 4 GB memory, and four ones with 8 GB memory. Using the Cifar100, FC100, and CORe50 datasets, this evaluation compares the three techniques (GEM, FedWEIT, and FedKNOW) that produce the highest accuracies among all techniques.

In particular, FedWEIT has the largest increase in training time because its global knowledge becomes larger with more tasks and clients. For example, FedWEIT’s training time of the last task is 1 hour longer than the other two techniques. (ii) Resource heterogeneity decreases accuracies for all three techniques by 3% to 5%. The results show FedKNOW still achieves the highest accuracies because it is lightweight and integrates task knowledge locally. In contrast, FedWEIT requires each client using the heavyweight global knowledge, which makes the Raspberry Pi of 2 GB memory out of memory after learning 7 tasks and cannot participate in the following federated learning.

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the evaluation settings of the previous section, this section’s evaluation focuses on communication cost in model training. We compare our approach with FedWEIT because in this method, each client needs to obtain the retained adaptive weights of all other clients before learning a new task. Although these weights bring higher accuracies, they also incur large communication traffic that increases with the number of clients.
In contrast, both our approach and other baseline methods employs the standard FedAvg method in federated learning and have the same communication cost.</p>

In federated learning, the communication cost among clients and the central server considerably impacts the model training performance (communication time takes about 10% to 30% of model training time). As shown in <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-C Evaluation of Communication Cost ‣ V Evaluation ‣ FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61872337, 62132019, 62272046) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2020MF034). Corresponding author: Rui Han." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, FedKNOW takes much less communication cost when performing the same model training task. This is because our approach employs a distributed knowledge retaining mechanism that each client only uses its own knowledge to retain previous tasks.
By contrast, FedWEIT applies a centralized mechanism that aggregates all clients’ adaptive weights in the server and uses these as the knowledge. This means each time a client learns a new task, it needs to send its latest model weights to the server and all other clients need to obtain these weights from the server. We note that in FedWEIT, a client’s own adaptive weights cannot represent its previous tasks. This is these parameters are generated using regularization techniques and in a client, different tasks’ adaptive weights have small differences. Hence FedWEIT needs to use other clients’ adaptive weights to increase the model generalization in continual learning.
Overall, our approach reduces communication cost by 34.28%.</p>

We can see that for both client numbers, FedKNOW can achieve the highest accuracies (Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-D Discussion of Task and Client Numbers ‣ V Evaluation ‣ FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61872337, 62132019, 62272046) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2020MF034).

This is because when the client number becomes larger and the training samples among different clients become more heterogeneous, the negative knowledge transfer becomes more severe. Our approach optimizes the gradient integration process and tries to minimize the influence of such negative transfer when learning new tasks, thus gaining more accuracy improvement when the degree of data Non-IID increases.
In most of the cases, GEM has higher accuracies than FedWEIT. This is because FedWEIT decomposes the weights of each layer into adaptive and base ones. However, ResNet-18 has several downsample layers with few but important weights, and the decomposition these layers degrades the model accuracy. In contrast, GEM maintains the architecture of the model and uses retained samples that provide higher accuracies than FedWEIT.</p>

The results show that when a new task comes, our method can re-train all these DNN models to maintain high accuracies for all learned tasks. Although the accuracies in all three methods decrease when the task number increases, our method provides the highest accuracies in all cases. This is because our knowledge extraction and integration mechanism maintains and restores the most task knowledge in the continual learning process.
In addition, we can see different models have different generalization capabilities and thus have different accuracies when learning the same tasks. For example, when comparing to the ResNet-18 model used in previous evaluations (Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Comparative Evaluations under Different FCL Scenarios ‣ V Evaluation ‣ FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61872337, 62132019, 62272046) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2020MF034).

<p id="S5.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, FedWEIT has the lowest accuracies when training these models. The main reason comes from the design of its loss function, which consists of three components: (1) the task loss; (2) the sparsity regularization penalty term for task-adaptive weights and masks; (3) the difference between the weights of two consecutive time steps. In training, two hyper-parameters are used to balance these components.
However, in this evaluation, different models have considerably different architectures and numbers of weights (for example, the size of ResNet152 is 117 MB while the size of MobileNetV2 is only 3.5 MB). This means the two hyper-parameters have to be carefully tuned for each model in its training.
Moreover, for compact networks such as MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and ResNeXt, sparse model weights may have no volume to store much knowledge. This further degrades the accuracy of FedWEIT.</p>

In this evaluation, we discuss three typical methods to retain previous knowledge in continual learning and show the impact of different parameter settings in these methods:
(1) GEM stores 10%, 20%, 50%, 100% of each task’s training samples and uses them when learning new tasks.
(2) FedWEIT decomposes and regularizes adaptive weights from each task’s learned model. In evaluation, we consider two settings: FedWEIT uses adaptive weights from all clients (the original setting) and it only uses adaptive weights from its own tasks in one client.
(3) FedKNOW extracts the most important weights of each task as its knowledge. Three percentages of weights with the largest values are tested: 5%, 10%, and 20%. MiniImageNet and ResNet-18 are tested here.

Corresponding author: Rui Han." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(a) show that retaining less information (samples or model weights) indeed causes lower accuracies in each method.
We can see that even when GEM uses 100% of previous training samples, it still provides lower accuracies than FedKNOW in most of the cases. This is because GEM does not consider negative knowledge transfer from other clients’ Non-IID data.
In contrast, FedKNOW optimizes the gradient integration to minimizes the influence of negative transfer while preventing forgetting previous tasks’ knowledge.
This allows our approach to avoid the influence of uncertain knowledge transfer from other clients in real scenarios, in which the clients participating in learning the model may dynamically change over time.</p>

FedWEIT only using one client’s adaptive weights takes the shortest time because it processes the least information, which is insufficiently to maintain previous knowledge and hence this method has the lowest accuracy.
GEM suffers most from processing more training samples. For example, the model training time on 100% previous samples is 2 to 3 times longer when only 10$ of previous samples are used.
In contrast, the differences of model training time among three knowledge sizes are much smaller in FedKNOW. This allows our approach to use larger knowledge to increase model accuracy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of FedKNOW, a framework that enables accurate and communication-efficient federated continual learning on distributed edge devices. FedKNOW is based on a novel optimization to integrate signature task knowledge. Our approach extracts and retains task knowledge from all learned tasks, while optimally assembling the most important knowledge to adapt to a new task with high accuracy and low communication overheads. Extensive evaluations in real scenarios against latest federated continual learning techniques strongly prove the efficacy and practicality of FedKNOW, especially for challenging learning scenarios of 80 different tasks and 100 clients.</p>
