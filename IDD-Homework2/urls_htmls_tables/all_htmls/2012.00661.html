<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables resource-constrained edge nodes to collaboratively learn a global model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping privacy-sensitive data locally. The non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data samples across participating nodes slow model training and impose additional communication rounds for FL to converge. In this paper, we propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Fed</span>erated <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Ad</span>a<span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">p</span>tive Weighting (<span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span>) algorithm that aims to accelerate model convergence under the presence of nodes with non-IID dataset. We observe the implicit connection between the node contribution to the global model aggregation and data distribution on the local node through theoretical and empirical analysis. We then propose to assign different weights for updating the global model based on node contribution adaptively through each training round. The contribution of participating nodes is first measured by the angle between the local gradient vector and the global gradient vector, and then, weight is quantified by a designed non-linear mapping function subsequently. The simple yet effective strategy can reinforce positive (suppress negative) node contribution dynamically, resulting in communication round reduction drastically. Its superiority over the commonly adopted Federated Averaging (<span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>) is verified both theoretically and experimentally. With extensive experiments performed in Pytorch and PySyft, we show that FL training with <span id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span> can reduce the number of communication rounds by up to 54.1% on MNIST dataset and up to 45.4% on FashionMNIST dataset, as compared to <span id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid advancement of edge devices (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), mobile phones) is constantly generating an unprecedented amount of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These devices are currently equipped with enhanced sensors, computing, and communication capability. Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning (DL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the edge devices unfold the countless opportunities for various tasks of modern society, e.g., road congestion prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and environmental monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the traditional cloud-centric approaches, data generated and collected by edge devices is uploaded and processed in a data center. It is predicted that the data generation rate will exceed the capacity of today’s Internet in the near future <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has naturally been proposed to incorporate the data processing outside the cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. With computing and storage capability, MEC systems generally consist of end-edge-server architecture. Multiple edge servers are capable of performing large-scale distributed tasks involving local processing and remote execution under the coordination of a remote cloud. MEC approaches compromise training efficiency and communication cost by bringing model training towards where the data is generated. However, computation offloading task and data processing at the edge server still involves the transmission of sensitive data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In either centralized cloud training or MEC approaches, collecting data for model training is unrealistic from a privacy, security, regulatory, or necessity perspective. In order to maintain privacy-sensitive data and to facilitate collaborative machine learning (ML) among distributed nodes, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an attractive paradigm, where local nodes collaboratively train a task model under the orchestration of a central server without accessing end-user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In FL, local nodes cooperatively train an ML <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">model</span> required by the central server by utilizing their local data. Through transferring local model updates to the central server for model aggregation and acquiring a global model for local training rather than sending raw data, user data privacy is well protected. As such, FL features from conventional approaches in data acquisition, storage, and training. FL has been deployed by major service providers and plays an important role in supporting privacy-sensitive applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and medical database<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Even though good convergence performance of FL approach is shown, owing to limited connectivity of wireless networks, the availability of local nodes and straggler of participating nodes, communication cost becomes a critical bottleneck in FL context since generally several iterations are involved for model converging<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Another fundamental challenge for FL is strongly non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) and highly skewed data across local nodes. The presence of non-IID data significantly degrades the performance of federated learning, which makes model training take more rounds to converge, and the variance caused by non-IID data brings instability to the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Since the completion time of federated learning is largely impacted by the communication time, how to reduce the communication round for model convergence in FL, especially for participating nodes with non-IID datasets, is urgent to be addressed.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to surmount the slow convergence of vanilla Federated Averaging (<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> under the presence of non-IID dataset, we propose <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Fed</span>erated <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Ad</span>a<span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">p</span>tive Weighting (<span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span>) algorithm that aims to improve the performance of federated learning through assigning distinct weight for participating node to update the global model. We observe that nodes with heterogeneous datasets make different contributions to the global model aggregation. Therefore, our main intuition is to measure the contribution of the participating node based on the gradient information from local nodes then assign different weights accordingly and adaptively at each communication round for global model aggregation. According to node contribution, the proposed adaptive weighting strategy is capable of reducing the expected training loss of FL in each communication round under the presence of non-IID nodes, which accelerates the model convergence.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, the FL algorithm adopts synchronous aggregation and selects a subset of nodes randomly to participate in each round randomly to avoid long-tailed waiting time due to the network uncertainty and straggler. To boost convergence and reduce the communication rounds, tuning the number of local updates<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and selecting appropriate nodes for FL training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> are the usually adopted approaches.</p>

Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> also posed local accuracy for participating nodes, based on limited computing resources on nodes, as an index to steer the number of local updates performed.

Regarding the node selection,
Nishio <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed <span id="S2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedCS</span> algorithm to do node selection intentionally rather than randomly, based on the resource conditions of local nodes. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> utilized gradient information to do node selection. The nodes whose inner product between its gradient vector and the global gradient vector is negative will be excluded from FL training.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To handle the non-IID data distribution,
Zhao <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> quantified the weight divergence by earth mover’s distance between data distribution on nodes and population distribution. However, the strategy of pushing a small set of uniformly distributed data to participating nodes in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> violates the privacy concern of FL and imposes extra communication cost. It was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> that communication rounds can be reduced effectively by selecting nodes based on their uploaded model weights, which profile the data distribution on those nodes. In contrast, Wang <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p3.1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a><span id="S2.p3.1.2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> proposed to identify the irrelevant update caused by different data distribution at the node side.
The communication cost is accordingly reduced by precluding these nodes with irrelevant updates before updates transmission. However, local nodes are required to check the relevance in each round using the global model kept in the previous round, which is in contravention of FL and brings computational burdens to local nodes.</p>

In this paper, we propose to measure the node contribution quantitatively by the angle between the local gradient at the nodes and the global gradient across all participating nodes at the server-side. With the quantified contribution, the weight for aggregating the global model can be devised discriminatively across the nodes and adaptively in each round according to node contribution.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we develop our methodology for improving the convergence rate of federated learning. We first analyze the convergence property of federated learning (Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Convergence Analysis ‣ IV Federated Adaptive Weighting ‣ Fast-Convergent Federated Learning with Adaptive Weighting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a>). The theoretical analysis on the expected decrease of FL loss in each round of training reveals that gradient information and data distribution impact the convergence. The experimental result shows the diversity of node contribution in reducing the FL loss in each round (Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Measurement of Node Contribution ‣ IV Federated Adaptive Weighting ‣ Fast-Convergent Federated Learning with Adaptive Weighting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>), measured by the local gradient of each node and the global gradient from participating nodes. This motivates us to assign weight adaptively according to node contribution for global model aggregation. Finally, we theoretically prove that assigning weight based on node contribution adaptively leads to accelerating model convergence and formally present the methodology of the proposed <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span> algorithm (Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Federated Adaptive Weighting (FedAdp) ‣ IV Federated Adaptive Weighting ‣ Fast-Convergent Federated Learning with Adaptive Weighting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>).</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented our design of <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span> algorithm that assigns nodes with different weights for updating the global model in each round adaptively to reduce the communication rounds of FL training in the presence of non-IID data. We argue that non-IID data exacerbates the model divergence and observe the nodes with non-IID data make a smaller (or even negative) contribution to the global model aggregation than the nodes with IID data. We have proposed to measure the node contribution based on the angle between local gradient and global gradient and designed a non-linear mapping function to quantify node contribution. We have designed an adaptive weighting strategy that assigns weight proportional to node contribution instead of according to the size of local datasets. The simple yet effective strategy is able to reinforce positive (suppress negative) node contribution dynamically, leading to a significant communication round reduction. Its performance superiority over <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> is verified both
theoretically and experimentally. We have shown that FL training with <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAdp</span> has reduced the communication rounds by up to 54.1% on the MNIST dataset and up to 45.4% on the FashionMNIST dataset compared to <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>.</p>
