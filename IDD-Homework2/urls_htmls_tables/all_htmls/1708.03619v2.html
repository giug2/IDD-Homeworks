<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging because it requires a simultaneous understanding of both visual content of images and textual content of questions. To support the VQA task, we need to find good solutions for the following three issues: 1) fine-grained feature representations for both the image and the question; 2) multi-modal feature fusion that is able to capture the complex interactions between multi-modal features; 3) automatic answer prediction that is able to consider the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers for the same question. For fine-grained image and question representations, a ‘co-attention’ mechanism is developed by using a deep neural network architecture to jointly learn the attentions for both the image and the question, which can allow us to reduce the irrelevant features effectively and obtain more discriminative features for image and question representations. For multi-modal feature fusion, a generalized Multi-modal Factorized High-order pooling approach (MFH) is developed to achieve more effective fusion of multi-modal features by exploiting their correlations sufficiently, which can further result in superior VQA performance as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. For answer prediction, the KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence is used as the loss function to achieve precise characterization of the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers with same or similar meaning, which can allow us to achieve faster convergence rate and obtain slightly better accuracy on answer prediction. A deep neural network architecture is designed to integrate all these aforementioned modules into a unified model for achieving superior VQA performance. With an ensemble of our MFH models, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale VQA datasets and win the runner-up in VQA Challenge 2017.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to recent advances of deep neural networks (DNN) in computer vision and natural language processing, computers are expected to be able to automatically understand the semantics of images and natural languages in the near future. Such advances also continue to redefine and drive research in image-text retrieval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and visual question answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with image-text retrieval and image captioning which just require the underlying algorithms to search or generate a free-form text description for a given image, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual question answering</em> (VQA) is a more challenging task that requires fine-grained understanding of the semantics of both the images and the questions as well as supports complex reasoning to predict the best-matching answer accurately. In some aspects, the VQA task can be treated as a generalization of image captioning and image-text retrieval. Thus building effective VQA algorithms which can achieve performance that is close to that of human beings, is an important step towards the general artificial intelligence.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To support the VQA task, we need to address the following three issues effectively (see the example in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Beyond Bilinear: Generalized Multimodal Factorized High-order Pooling for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>): (1) extracting discriminative features for image and question representations; (2) combining the visual features from the image and the textual features from the question to generate the fused image-question features; (3) using the fused image-question features to learn a multi-class classifier for predicting the best-matching answer correctly. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are very effective and flexible, most of the existing VQA approaches tackle these three issues in one single DNNs model and train the model in an end-to-end fashion through back-propagation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For feature-based image representation, directly using the global features extracted from the whole image may introduce noisy information (i.e., irrelevant features) that are irrelevant to the given question, e.g., the given question may strongly relate to only a small part of the image (i.e., image attention region) rather than the whole image. Therefore, it is intuitive to introduce <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual attention</em> mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> into the VQA task to adaptively learn the most relevant image regions for a given question. Modeling visual attention may significantly improve performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, the questions interpreted in natural languages may also contain colloquialisms that can be treated as noise, thus it is very important to model the question attention simultaneously. Unfortunately, most existing approaches only model the image attention without considering the question attention. Motivated by these observations, we design a deep network architecture for the VQA task by using a <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">co-attention learning</em> module to jointly learn the attentions for both the image and the question, which may allow us to extract more discriminative features for image and question representations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For multi-modal feature fusion, most existing approaches simply use linear models (e.g., concatenation or element-wise addition) to integrate the visual feature from the image with the textual feature from the question even their distributions may vary dramatically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Such linear models may not be able to generate expressive image-question features that are able to fully capture the complex correlations between multi-modal features. In contrast to linear pooling, bilinear pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has recently been used to integrate different CNN features for fine-grained image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, such bilinear pooling approach may output high-dimensional features for image-question representation and the underlying deep networks for feature extraction may contain huge number of model parameters, which may seriously limit its applicability for VQA. To tackle these problems effectively, Multi-modal Compact Bilinear (MCB) pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and Multi-modal Low-rank Bilinear (MLB) pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have been developed to reduce the computational complexity of the original bilinear pooling model and make it practicable for VQA. However, MCB needs very high-dimensional feature to guarantee good performance and MLB needs a great many training iterations to converge to a satisfactory solution. To tackle these problems, we propose a Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling approach (MFB) which enjoys the dual benefits of compact output features of MLB and robust expressive capacity of MCB. Moreover, we extend the bilinear MFB model to a generalized high-order setting and proposed a Multi-modal Factorized High-order pooling (MFH) method to achieve more effective fusion of multi-modal features by exploiting their complex correlations sufficiently. By introducing more complex high-order interactions between multi-modal features, our MFH method can achieve more discriminative image-question representation and further result in significant improvement on the VQA performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For answer prediction, some datasets like VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> provide multiple answers for each image-question pair and such diverse answers are typically annotated by different users. As the answers are represented in natural languages, for a given question, different users may provide diverse answers or expressions which have same or similar meaning, thus such diverse answers may have strong correlations and they are not independent at all. For example, both <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a little dog</em> and <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a puppy</em> could be the correct answers for the same question. Motivated by these observations, it is important to design an appropriate mechanism to model the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers for the same question. In MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, an <em id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">answer sampling</em> strategy was proposed to randomly pick an answer from a set of candidates during the training course. In this way, the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers could be eventually learned by the model with sufficient training iterations. In this paper, we formulate the problem of answer prediction as a <em id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">label distribution learning</em> problem. The answers for an image-question pair in the training dataset are converted to a probability distribution over all possible answers. We use the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as the loss function to achieve more accurate characterization of the consistency between the probability distribution of the predicted answers and the probability distribution of the ground truth answers given by the annotators. Compared with the answer sampling method in MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, using the KLD loss can achieve faster convergence rate and obtain slightly better accuracy on answer prediction.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Malinowski <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> made an early attempt at solving the VQA task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Since then, solving the VQA task has received increasing attention from the communities of computer vision and natural language processing. Most existing VQA approaches can be classified into the following three categories: (a) the coarse joint-embedding models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>; (b) the fine-grained joint-embedding models with attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>; (c) the external knowledge based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The coarse joint-embedding models are the most straightforward solution for VQA. Image and question are first represented as global features and then integrated to predict the answer. Zhou <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a baseline approach for the VQA task by using the concatenation of the image CNN features and the question BoW (bag-of-words) features, and a linear classifier is learned to predict the answer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Wang <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> perform a detailed analysis on the modeling of questions using CNN to obtain better question representations for VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Some approaches introduce more complex deep models, e.g., LSTM networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or residual networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, to tackle the VQA task in an end-to-end fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One limitation of joint-embedding models is that their global features may contain noisy information (i.e., irrelevant features), and such noisy global features may not be able to answer the fine-grained problems correctly (e.g., “what color are the cat’s eyes?”) . Therefore, recent VQA approaches introduce the <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual attention</em> mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> into the VQA task by adaptively learning the local fine-grained image features for a given question. Chen <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a question-guided attention map that projects the question embeddings to the visual space and formulates a configurable convolutional kernel to search the image attention region <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the joint embedding models can deliver impressive VQA performance, they are not good enough for answering the questions that require complex reasoning or knowledge of common senses. Therefore, introducing external knowledge is beneficial for VQA. However, existing approaches have either only been applied to specific datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, or have been ineffective on benchmark datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-modal feature fusion plays a critical and fundamental role in VQA. After the image and the question representations are obtained, concatenation or element-wise summations are most frequently used for multi-modal feature fusion. Since the distributions of two feature sets in different modalities (i.e.,the visual features from images and the textual features from questions) may vary significantly, the representation capacity of the simply-fused features may be insufficient, limiting the final prediction performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fukui <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> first introduced the bilinear model to solve the problem of multi-modal feature fusion in VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In contrast to the aforementioned approaches, they proposed the Multi-modal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), which uses the outer product of two feature vectors in different modalities to produce a very high-dimensional feature for quadratic expansion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. To reduce the computational cost, they used a sampling-based approximation approach that exploits the property that the projection of two vectors can be represented as their convolution. The MCB model outperformed the simple fusion approaches and demonstrated superior performance on the VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, MCB usually needs high-dimensional features (e.g., 16,000-D) to guarantee robust performance, which may seriously limit its applicability for VQA due to limitations in GPU memory.</p>

Since the MLB approach can generate feature vectors with low dimensions and deep networks with fewer model parameters, it has achieved very comparable performance to MCB. In MLB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the experimental results indicated that MLB may lead to a slow convergence rate (the MLB with attention model takes 250k iterations with the batch size 200, which is about 140 epochs, to converge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>).</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first revisit the multi-modal bilinear models and then introduce the Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) model. We give detailed explanation on the implementation of our MFB model and further analyze its relationship with the existing MLB approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. By treating our MFB model as the basic building block, we extend the idea of bilinear pooling to a generalized high-order pooling and we further propose a Multi-modal High-order pooling (MFH) model by simply cascading multiple MFB blocks to capture more complex high-order interactions between multi-modal features.</p>

The approach can be easily implemented by combining some commonly-used layers such as fully-connected, element-wise multiplication and pooling layers. Furthermore, to prevent over-fitting, a dropout layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is added after the element-wise multiplication layer. Since element-wise multiplication is introduced, the magnitude of the output neurons may vary dramatically, and the model might converge to an unsatisfactory local minimum.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the previous work like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, we have witnessed that the bilinear pooling models have superior representation capacity than the traditional linear pooling models. This inspires us that exploiting the complex interactions among the feature dimensions is beneficial for capturing the common semantics of multi-modal features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Therefore, a natural idea is to extend the second-order bilinear pooling to the generalized high-order pooling to further enhance the representation capacity of fused features. In this section, we introduce a generalized Multi-modal Factorized High-order pooling (MFH) model by cascading multiple MFB blocks.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of the VQA task is to answer a question about an image. The inputs to the model contain an image and a corresponding question about the image. Our model extracts the representations for both the image and the question, integrates multi-modal features by using the MFB or MFH module in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ III-A Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling ‣ III Generalized Multi-modal Factorized High-order Pooling ‣ Beyond Bilinear: Generalized Multimodal Factorized High-order Pooling for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>, treats each individual answer as one class and performs multi-class classification to predict the correct answer. In this section, two network architectures are introduced. The first one is the baseline with one MFB or MFH module, which is used to perform ablation analysis with different hyper-parameters for comparison with other baseline approaches. The second one introduces co-attention learning to achieve more effective characterization of the fine-grained correlations between multi-modal features, which may result in a model with better representation capability.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For a given image, different questions could result into an entire different set of answers. Therefore, an <em id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">image attention</em> model, which can predict the relevance between each spatial grid of the image with the question, is beneficial for predicting the best-matching answer accurately. From the results reported in MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, one can see that incorporating such image attention mechanism allows the model to effectively learn which image region is important for the question, clearly contributing to better performance than the models without using attention. However, their attention model only focuses on learning the image attention while completely ignoring the question attention. Since the questions are interpreted in natural languages, the contribution of each word is definitely different. Therefore, we develop a co-attention learning approach named MFB+CoAtt or MFH+CoAtt (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B The Co-Attention Model ‣ IV Network Architectures for VQA ‣ Beyond Bilinear: Generalized Multimodal Factorized High-order Pooling for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) to jointly learn the attentions for both the question and the image.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most existing VQA approaches, the answering stage is formulated as a multi-class classification problem and each answer refers to an individual class. In practice, this assumption may not hold for the VQA task because the answers with the same or similar meaning can be expressed diversely by different annotators. For example, both the answers ‘<em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a little dog</em>’ and ‘<em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a puppy</em>’ could be correct for a given image-question pair.

Compared with the VQA dataset, it contains more training samples (440k question-answer pairs for training and 214k pairs for validation), and is more balanced to weaken the potential that an overfitted model may achieve good results. Specifically, for every question there are two images in the dataset that result in two different answers to the question. At this point only the train and validation sets are available. Therefore, we report the results of the Open-Ended task on validation set with the model trained on train set. The evaluation criterion on this dataset is same as the one used in the VQA-1.0 dataset.</p>

We report the overall accuracy 70.92<math id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS5.p3.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> on the test-standard set of VQA-2.0 with 8 models while they report the accuracy 70.34<math id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS5.p3.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> with up to 30 models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a network architecture with co-attention learning is designed to model both the image attention and the question attention simultaneously, so that we can reduce the irrelevant features effectively and extract more discriminative features for image and question representations. A Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) approach is developed to achieve more effective fusion of the visual features from the images and the textual features from the questions, and a generalized high-order model called MFH is developed to capture more complex interactions between multi-modal features. Compared with the existing bilinear pooling methods, our proposed MFB and MFH approaches can achieve significant improvement on the VQA performance because they can achieve more effective exploitation of the complex correlations between multi-modal features. By using the KL divergence as the loss function, our proposed answer prediction approach can achieve faster convergence rate and obtain better performance as compared with the state-of-the-art strategies. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our approaches have achieved the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two large-scale real-world VQA datasets.</p>
