<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain’s information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR. Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition. These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions. Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability. Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity. For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features. We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN’s temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information. To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data. We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human intelligence, developed over a long period of evolution, has demonstrated remarkable wisdom and inspired the development of artificial intelligence. Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a prime example of this, as humans naturally rely on the speaker’s lip movements to aid in understanding speech. Compared to traditional speech recognition, AVSR integrates auditory and visual information to develop more robust and accurate systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third generation of neural networks that mimic the brain’s information-processing mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Roy, Jaiswal, and Panda <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) that use continuous floating-point numbers, SNNs communicate between neurons using discrete signal timing, known as spikes. With their inherent temporal characteristics, SNNs excel at processing spatio-temporal information with lower energy consumption, making them particularly well-suited for speech recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. These capabilities make SNNs promising models for emulating the human brain’s remarkable AVSR abilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, research on SNNs for AVSR remains scarce. Existing audio-visual multimodal SNNs primarily focus on object or digit recognition, and their application to AVSR presents several challenges. First, most existing methods simply concatenate or add features from both modalities. They treat all features equally, overlooking the unique characteristics and interactions of the auditory and visual modalities. Second, some studies rely on using future information for current recognition. This necessitates waiting for all data to be input before processing can begin, preventing immediate recognition and increasing latency. Even the only existing SNN-based AVSR method, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yu et al. <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, suffers from these two weaknesses. Overall, despite using spikes, existing audio-visual multimodal methods do not fully explore and mimic how the human brain processes the audio and visual modalities.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Current studies on human speech perception reveal the possible roles of visual modality in improving speech intelligibility. When one speaks, lips are found to move before the arrival of the voice, which cues listeners to pay attention to the speech signals of interest
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Summerfield <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">1976</a>; Golumbic et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Grant and Seitz <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>; Grant <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Schwartz, Berthommier, and Savariaux <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>. Additionally, visual cues from lip movements may influence hearing at an elementary level, rather than being incorporated after hearing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Varghese et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Wang, Qian, and Li <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
These findings led us to recognize the distinct roles of visual and auditory modalities, challenging previous approaches that relied on simple concatenation and summarization. Since lip movements precede hearing sounds, visual information should be processed first, serving as a cue for the auditory modality to guide attention. Such cues should be provided early to influence auditory processing, rather than integrating them at the decision-making stage. Furthermore, human brain processes speech in real time, without waiting for speakers to finish speaking before beginning to process. Human short-term memory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jonides et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> enables individuals to integrate current and past inputs for decision-making, thereby enhancing real-time speech comprehension capabilities. By leveraging these insights, we will make steps towards the advanced human-inspired SNN-based AVSR system.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel human-inspired spiking neural network named HI-AVSNN for audio-visual speech recognition. HI-AVSNN incorporates three key characteristics that simulate human brain speech perception: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity.
Firstly, to facilitate effective interaction between visual and auditory modalities, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M). This module enables visual features to dynamically guide auditory processing, directing attention to the most critical auditory features. By continuously providing visual cues during auditory processing, our method ensures the system focuses on key features, enhancing recognition accuracy and robustness.
Secondly, to ensure causal processing using only past and current information, HI-AVSNN aligns the timesteps of SNN with the time dimension of the visual and auditory features, as shown in Figure <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This alignment naturally restricts the system to utilizing only past and current information. We additionally utilize temporal masking to ensure that the attention generated in VCA2M is based solely on past and current information. Thirdly, regarding spiking activity, we leverage event cameras alongside SNN. Event cameras output spikes that record brightness changes, mimicking the human retina <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gallego et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. This allows the system to focus on lip movements while ignoring static backgrounds, leading to more precise and efficient visual acquisition for AVSR. We evaluate our proposed HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset (combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio files). Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our fusion method over other audio-visual SNN fusion methods. Notably, it outperforms the only existing SNN-based AVSR method by 2.27% accuracy.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Event-based Lip Reading</h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The visual inputs for the proposed HI-AVSNN are from the event camera. Event cameras record pixel-level changes in brightness on a logarithmic scale as a stream of asynchronous events (spikes), inspired by the mechanism of the human retina <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gallego et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. They respond solely to moving objects, thereby ignoring static redundant information, which leads to a reduction in memory usage and energy consumption. Moreover, event cameras feature a high dynamic range of up to 140 dB, enabling them to capture visual information under extreme lighting conditions. These advantages allow event cameras to efficiently and finely record lip movements. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> first studied the event-based lip reading and proposed a multi-grained spatio-temporal feature perceived network, demonstrating the advantages of applying event cameras to lip reading tasks. SNNs are inherently suited to work with event cameras due to their shared characteristics of event-based processing and imitation of biological neural systems. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bulzomi et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> recently proposed the first event-based lip-reading SNN using a similar architecture as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced significantly with improvements in signal processing and neural network methods. Raw speech undergoes feature extraction using techniques like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and filter banks (Fbank) to generate spectral features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have been widely used to interpret the temporal dynamics of speech patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abdel-Hamid et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Arisoy et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Shewalkar, Nyavanandi, and Ludwig <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. More recently, SNNs have emerged as a compelling approach for processing speech. Some studies have shown promising results using ANN-to-SNN conversion algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Yılmaz et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Yang, Liu, and Li <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. However, these methods do not fully utilize the temporal strengths of SNNs, as they rely on approximating the activation patterns of ANNs rather than leveraging the unique spiking dynamics of SNNs. In contrast, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bittar and Garner <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed recurrent spiking neurons that can use directly-trained SNN to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art ANNs, highlighting the potential of SNNs in ASR.</p>

As the SNN naturally processes only the current input and previous states, this alignment prevents the system from utilizing future information. The masking mechanism in VCA2M further ensures that the attention generated in VCA2M is based solely on past and current information. In contrast, existing audio-visual SNNs process auditory features by treating them as an image, disregarding the temporal characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Yu et al. <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> does not apply masking in attention, which introduces future information. As a result, these non-causal approaches require waiting until the entire sample is input before processing, leading to increased system latency. Our design, in contrast, guarantees that HI-AVSNN processes data in a causal, real-time manner.</p>

Since the variables in this module are all spike tensors (naturally non-negative), the calculation involves only addition operations, and softmax operations can also be removed, which facilitates the energy efficiency of our HI-AVSNN. However, without any constraints, future information will be included in the attention calculation as the attention allows each token to attend to every other token in the sequence, including those that come later. To ensure that only past and current information are considered, we implement a masking to the attention weight for filtering out future information. The new attention becomes</p>

<div id="Sx4.SSx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we verify the noise robustness of our proposed HI-AVSNN. Due to the recording device and environments, some of the original audio files in the DVSlip-Audio dataset naturally contain noise. We categorize these files as “noise*”, while the original files without noise are labeled as “clean”. During training, we add babble noise at levels of 10 dB, 5 dB, 0 dB, and -5 dB to the clean files. We then respectively test the SNNs on these different noise levels to evaluate the robustness. Babble noise is generated by mixing samples as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Afouras et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed HI-AVSNN achieves the highest accuracy in both clean and noisy environments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. While the audio unimodal method performs well on clean audio with an accuracy of 86.23%, its performance significantly drops as noise levels increase, falling to 62.43% at -5 dB, a decline of 20%. In contrast, audio-visual multimodal solutions, including the baseline and our HI-AVSNN, maintain higher accuracy across all noise levels. From the clean environment to the -5 dB SNR environment, the accuracy drops by less than 15%, indicating the advantage of integrating visual information. Furthermore, our SNN outperforms the baseline, particularly at higher noise levels. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our human-inspired fusion strategy in enhancing noise robustness, ensuring more reliable performance under challenging conditions.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For single cueing, we insert VCA2M at four different positions respectively and compare their accuracy and the number of parameters. As shown in Figure <a href="#Sx4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Position of Cueing ‣ Experiment ‣ Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, accuracy increases as the cueing position is delayed from the first block to the third block. This improvement could be due to the auditory features becoming more refined and contextually rich as the network progresses, allowing the visual cue to have a more meaningful impact on enhancing relevant auditory information, thereby improving the overall accuracy. However, when cueing is applied in the final layer, a decline in accuracy is observed. This decrease may be attributed to the fact that the accuracy of visual unimodality is only 50%, as shown in Table <a href="#Sx4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Performance Comparison ‣ Experiment ‣ Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which is lower than that of audio unimodality. Consequently, fusing visual information at the final layer might negatively impact the more accurate audio processing. Additionally, the number of parameters remains consistent across all four configurations, with each containing 10.35M parameters, ensuring a fair comparison.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For multiple cueing, we use the SNN with cueing only before the third speech block as the baseline, as it achieves the highest accuracy in single cueing experiment, with an accuracy of 85.41%. Building on this baseline, we systematically insert VCA2Ms before additional blocks, following the order of their single-cueing accuracy, resulting in three additional configurations: cueing before both the second and third speech blocks; cueing before the first, second, and third speech block; cueing at every position (before first, second and third speech block as well as the final layer). As shown in Figure <a href="#Sx4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Position of Cueing ‣ Experiment ‣ Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, comparing the first three configurations, the accuracy improves as visual cues are provided in more positions. This suggests that engaging multiple cueing allows the SNN to better leverage visual information, resulting in more effective recognition. However, when cueing is introduced at all positions, including the final layer, accuracy decreases despite the increase in parameters. This decline indicates that while visual information is beneficial, cueing at each position does not necessarily enhance performance, as fusing visual information in the final layer may interfere with the more refined audio processing.</p>

This reduction highlights the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks.
When comparing our HI-AVSNN with other SNNs, we observed that while our HI-AVSNN consumes 0.04 mJ more energy than the baseline SNN—due to the baseline’s simpler structure—the energy consumption of our HI-AVSNN is still lower than that of other existing fusion methods. As seen in Table <a href="#Sx4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Performance Comparison ‣ Experiment ‣ Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our HI-AVSNN has more parameters than these other SNNs. The reduced energy consumption can be attributed to the greater sparsity of spikes in our HI-AVSNN.
We acknowledge that energy consumption arises not only from computation but also from memory access, which involves hardware design considerations beyond the scope of our study. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that the binary nature and greater sparsity of our HI-AVSNN can help reduce access-related energy consumption.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a human-inspired audio-visual speech recognition SNN, incorporating three key characteristics of human speech perception: 1) spike activity, 2) cueing interaction, and 3) causal processing. For spike activity, we utilize the SNN to process information and an event camera to capture the lip movement. For cueing interaction, we introduce a visual-cued auditory attention module that guides auditory processing by highlighting relevant features. For causal processing, we align the SNN’s temporal dimension with visual and auditory features and apply temporal masking to use only past and current information. Experimental results on the DVSlip-Audio dataset demonstrate our superior performance compared to other audio-visual multimodal fusion methods. We also validate its noise robustness and recognition efficiency. Ablation studies explore the impact of cueing positions on performance. Finally, energy consumption analysis confirms the energy efficiency of our HI-AVSNN. Our work marks a step forward in brain-inspired computing, offering a highly efficient and robust solution for real-world audio-visual speech recognition tasks.</p>
