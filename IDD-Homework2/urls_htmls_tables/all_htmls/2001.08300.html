<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Many image and vision applications require a large amount of data for model training. Collecting all such data at a central location can be challenging due to data privacy and communication bandwidth restrictions. Federated learning is an effective way of training a machine learning model in a distributed manner from local data collected by client devices, which does not require exchanging the raw data among clients. A challenge is that among the large variety of data collected at each client, it is likely that only a subset is relevant for a learning task while the rest of data has a negative impact on model training. Therefore, before starting the learning process, it is important to select the subset of data that is relevant to the given federated learning task. In this paper, we propose a method for distributedly selecting relevant data, where we use a benchmark model trained on a small benchmark dataset that is task-specific, to evaluate the relevance of individual data samples at each client and select the data with sufficiently high relevance. Then, each client only uses the selected subset of its data in the federated learning process. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is evaluated on multiple real-world image datasets in a simulated system with a large number of clients, showing up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="25\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">25</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">25</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">25\%</annotation></semantics></math> improvement in model accuracy compared to training with all data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modern applications of image recognition and computer vision are usually based on machine learning models such as deep neural networks. Training such models requires a large amount of data that are specific to the learning task. Due to privacy regulations and communication bandwidth limitation, it can be difficult to collect all the data at a central location.
To benefit from the local data collected by and stored at client devices (e.g., mobile phones, surveillance cameras), <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> has been proposed as a way of distributed model training without exchanging raw data, which preserves data privacy and conserves communication bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In federated learning, multiple clients participate in model training in a collaborative and coordinated manner. The learning proceeds by iteratively exchanging model parameters between the clients and a server, while each client’s local data are <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> shared with others.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing work on federated learning mostly focused on model training using pre-defined datasets at client devices. While such scenarios are meaningful, it can be far from practical situations where each client can have a large variety of data which may or may not be relevant to the given federated learning task, and the relevance is unknown by the system. For example, if the task is to classify handwritten digits, printed digits can be considered as irrelevant data although they may be tagged with the same set of labels (thus difficult for the system to distinguish). Including irrelevant data in the federated learning process can reduce model accuracy and slow down training.
In this paper, we address the following problem: how does a client select relevant data for a given federated learning task?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a federated learning system with a <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model requester</em> (MR), multiple clients, and a server. A federated learning task is defined by the MR which provides the model logic (e.g., a specific deep neural network architecture). The MR can be any user device with computational capability, which may or may not be a client or the server at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel method for identifying relevant data at each client for a given federated learning task. In our proposed approach, the MR has a small set of <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">benchmark data</em> that is used as an example to capture the desired input-output relation of the trained model, but is insufficient to train the model itself. The benchmark data does <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> need to be shared with the server or other clients directly, only a <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">benchmark model</em> trained on the benchmark data needs to be shared, thus preserving privacy. Using the benchmark model provided by the MR, each client identifies a subset of its data that will be involved in this federated learning task. Then, federated learning proceeds, where each client’s local computation is only performed on its selected data. In this way, our approach works in a distributed manner without requiring clients or MR to share raw data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of our proposed approach is evaluated with extensive experiments. On a variety of real-world image datasets with different types of noise (see the definition of “noise” in Section <a href="#S2" title="II Related Work ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>), we show that our data selection approach outperforms other baseline approaches even when the MR only has a very small amount of benchmark data. Furthermore, we show that data selection also speeds up the overall federated learning process.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was first introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which allows multiple client devices to learn a global model while keeping their raw data stored locally. In federated learning settings, some work has studied the case with malicious clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, where both defense and attacking mechanisms are considered.
The above body of work focuses on a unified behavior of a client or the server in its entirety, i.e., the entire client/server is either malicious or not.
It does not allow the more realistic setting where relevant and irrelevant data (with respect to a particular learning task) coexist at each client.</p>

Very recently, the <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">weak open-set</em> noise setting is studied by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
We note that all the approaches that address the strong noise scenario require a small set of clean benchmark data, as we do in our paper. In addition, existing approaches for the open-set setting involve very complex models that need to be trained on the entire dataset even though they only apply to the weak noise scenario, which makes them infeasible for distributed datasets in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of filtering out noisy training data is also broadly related to the area of anomaly/outlier detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, anomaly detection techniques focus on detecting anomalous data samples based on the underlying distribution of the data itself, instead of how the data impacts model training. For example, the impact of two training data samples may be similar for one learning task, but different for another learning task. Such task-specific characteristics are not considered in anomaly/outlier detection techniques.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, there is a significant gap between the above existing work and the problem we solve in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, none of the following aspects has been studied in the literature: 1) strong open-set noise in training data and its impact on the learning performance, 2) data cleansing/filtering in federated learning with decentralized datasets located at clients.
In federated learning, strong open-set noise can frequently exist in scenarios where only a small portion of the data at each client is relevant to the given task. In this paper, we propose a novel method of filtering the data in a <em id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">distributed manner</em> for federated learning with <em id="S2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">strong open-set noise</em>, which also works in weak noise and closed-set noise scenarios at the same time.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a federated learning system with multiple clients and a server. Each client has its own local dataset with diverse types of data. As described in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, a federated learning task is initiated by an MR. The MR specifies what model needs to be trained, and also has a small <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">benchmark dataset</em> that can be generated by the MR based on its own knowledge of the learning task or via other means, but are deemed to have correct labels for all data in it. In the case where the MR is also a client, this client’s local dataset can be considered as the benchmark data. However, the amount of benchmark data is usually very small compared to the collection of all clients’ local data and is therefore insufficient for training a highly accurate model, which is why federated learning involving multiple clients is needed.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Each client may have different amounts of relevant and irrelevant data with respect to a federated learning task.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data selection is performed at the beginning of each federated learning task, before the distributed model training process (i.e., Steps 1–4 in Section <a href="#S3" title="III System Model and Definitions ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) starts. The goal is to filter out noisy data samples to the specific federated learning task. The filtering process is decentralized, where each client performs the filtering operation on its own dataset and only exchanges a small amount of meta-information with the server.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main idea is that the MR first trains a <em id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">benchmark model</em> (of the same type as the final model requested by the MR) using <em id="S4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">only a subset</em> of the benchmark data owned by the MR<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Note that training the benchmark model is usually less computationally intensive than training the final model using federated learning, because the benchmark dataset size is usually small. Therefore, we assume that the benchmark model can be trained by the MR on its own.</span></span></span>.
Although the benchmark model is trained with a small amount of data that is insufficient to provide a good classification accuracy on its own, it still captures useful characteristics of the training data, which is helpful for determining the relevance of local data at clients. In particular, for a data sample that is irrelevant to the learning task, the benchmark model would likely predict a label distribution (i.e., the output of the model) that has a higher entropy. In other words, the predicted label is more uncertain for irrelevant data samples. Such uncertainty (or incorrectness of the predicted label) is reflected by a higher loss value for the particular sample.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We partition data into clients in a non-i.i.d. manner as in realistic federated learning scenarios.
For FEMNIST which is already partitioned by the writers, we consider the images from each writer as belonging to a separate client.
For all other datasets, the data are distributed into clients so that each client has only one class (label) of data from that dataset. The clients and labels are associated randomly, so that the number of clients for each label differ by at most one. For all clients with the same label, the data with this label are partitioned into clients randomly.
When multiple datasets are mixed together (the open-set noise setting), different clients have different proportions of samples from each dataset, resulting in different amount of data samples in total.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Open-set noisy data are constructed by adding data from other datasets as noise to a given “target” dataset (i.e., the clean dataset for the model being trained in the task). We mix the noisy data samples to the target dataset, and preserve their labels in the mixed dataset<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>This is a common practice for simulating open-set noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span>.
For example, we sample some data from SVHN (acting as noise, with labels 0–9) and add them to MNIST (acting as the target dataset, with labels 0–9) while keeping the same label, e.g., data with label 0 in SVHN is mixed only with data with label 0 in MNIST. Even if the number of labels in the noise dataset is different from that of the target dataset, we apply the noise only to the labels that are common to both datasets; e.g., CIFAR-10’s data with 10 labels are added to the corresponding first 10 classes of FEMNIST, or CIFAR-100’s first 62 classes of data are mixed to the corresponding classes of FEMNIST.
Additionally, in order to mix different datasets and train them together, we transform the open-set noise data such that their dimensions are the same as that of the target dataset (e.g., when training a classifier for SVHN with MNIST as noise, we transform MNIST to color images, and resize them to <math id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="32\times 32" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">32</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">32</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">32</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">32</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">32\times 32</annotation></semantics></math> pixels).</p>

We see that, in all cases, our approach always performs very close to the ideal case baseline (“FEMINIST only”), and significantly better than the benchmark model and the one trained with the entire dataset with both target and noise. This shows the robustness of our approach to both open-set and closed-set noise.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The overall trend in the performance is similar to what is observed with mild noise levels in Figures <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A2 Data Partition Among Clients ‣ V-A Setup ‣ V Experimentation Results ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-A2 Data Partition Among Clients ‣ V-A Setup ‣ V Experimentation Results ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Our approach achieves a model accuracy very close to the ideal-case baseline, while significantly outperforming the case without data selection. The benchmark model in this case performs reasonably well, too, since a relatively small amount of training data for these two target datasets (SVHN and FASHION) is generally sufficient to train a model achieving good accuracy. However, as observed in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B1 Data Selection Performance (Different Types of Noise) ‣ V-B Results ‣ V Experimentation Results ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the benchmark models still suffer when the benchmark dataset is very small, whereas our data selection method performs well, indicating that our method enables effective federated learning even under strong noise levels and small benchmark dataset.</p>

We study the time of a cycle using real measurements of the computation time on Raspberry Pi 4 devices and simulated transmission times (for sending model parameters between clients and server) under different communication bandwidths.
The results are shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B3 Completion Time ‣ V-B Results ‣ V Experimentation Results ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. We see that data selection also reduces the training time, because by having only a subset of relevant data involved in each task, the mini-batch sizes at clients are smaller than involving all the data at clients, as we use a variable mini-batch size equal to a fixed percentage of the data size (see the discussion in Section <a href="#S3" title="III System Model and Definitions ‣ Overcoming Noisy and Irrelevant Data in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>). Note that even if we fix the mini-batch size, the overall time for each client to make a pass over all its data (i.e., one epoch) is still shorter when using data selection.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have considered a challenge in federated learning where each client may have various types of local data with noisy labels. To overcome this challenge, we have proposed a method for selecting the subset of relevant data to be involved in a federated learning task. Through extensive experimental analysis using multiple real-world image datasets, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our data selection method in strong open-set noise setting, and its advantages over multiple baseline approaches.</p>
