<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Crack segmentation is a critical task in civil engineering applications, particularly for assessing pavement integrity and ensuring the durability of transportation infrastructure. While deep learning models have advanced RGB-based segmentation, their performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination and motion blur. Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, enabling better differentiation of cracks in challenging environments. By integrating information from both RGB and thermal images, RGB-T pavement crack segmentation has demonstrated significant advantages in complex real-world environments such as adverse weather conditions. However, research in this area remains relatively limited, and current RGB-T crack segmentation methods do not fully and efficiently leverage the complementary relationships between different modalities during multi-level information interaction.
To address this problem, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data. We introduce the Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module (EGTCF) to capture extensive multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without incurring high computational costs. Additionally, we develop the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision (IHBS) framework, which enhances modality interaction by distributing fused features across branches and enabling joint supervision. To preserve the topological structure of cracks, we propose a novel topology-based loss function that maintains connectivity and structural integrity during training.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing approaches with a Dice score of 90.01% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 81.83%. These advancements address critical challenges in pavement crack segmentation by improving robustness and accuracy under varying environmental conditions.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Crack segmentation, which involves assigning binary labels—crack or background—to individual pixels in an image, has attracted growing attention in various civil engineering scenarios such as buildings<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Dais et al.(2021)Dais, Bal, Smyrou, and Sarhosis</a>]</cite>, bridges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">Tran et al.(2023)Tran, Nguyen, Lee, and Tran</a>]</cite>, tunnels<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.(2021)Wang, Li, Dang, Lee, and Moon</a>]</cite>, and pavement<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Han et al.(2024)Han, Yang, Ma, Wang, Zhao, and Yang</a>]</cite> inspections. Among these, pavement crack segmentation is particularly crucial for assessing road quality and maintaining the longevity. Traditional image processing techniques like thresholding<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li and Liu(2008)</a>]</cite> and edge detection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lokeshwor et al.(2014)Lokeshwor, Das, and Goel</a>]</cite> have been used to segment pavement cracks in RGB images by exploiting grayscale value differences. However, these methods often suffer from low accuracy and lack robustness due to their reliance on handcrafted settings and sensitivity to varying imaging conditions.
The advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized semantic segmentation tasks. Methods like FCN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Long et al.(2015)Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell</a>]</cite>, U-Net<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ronneberger et al.(2015)Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox</a>]</cite>, UNet++<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zhou et al.(2019)Zhou, Siddiquee, Tajbakhsh, and Liang</a>]</cite>, and DeepLab V3+<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2018)Chen, Zhu, Papandreou, Schroff, and Adam</a>]</cite> have achieved impressive results on large-scale RGB image semantic segmentation task. Consequently, researchers have adapted these paradigms for pavement crack segmentation. For instance, DeepCrack<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zou et al.(2019)Zou, Zhang, Li, Qi, Wang, and Wang</a>]</cite> integrates multi-scale convolutional features from hierarchical stages to capture fine-grained line structures, leading to improved crack detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these advancements, RGB-based pavement crack segmentation methods degrade rapidly under challenging conditions such as rainy or hazy weather and low illumination<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Fan et al.(2023)Fan, Li, Li, Li, Cao, and Wang</a>]</cite>. During pavement inspections, cameras mounted on fast-moving vehicles like inspection trucks or drones struggle to maintain stable footage, minimize motion blur, and ensure adequate illumination simultaneously. Consequently, underexposed and blurred RGB images yield unfavorable segmentation results compared to normal conditions, as shown in the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ IRFusionFormer: Enhancing Pavement Crack Segmentation with RGB-T Fusion and Topological-Based Loss" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a)</span>. Additionally, semantic interferences resembling cracks—such as scattered binding particles, tree shadows, water marks, and patch repairs—introduce additional complexities, leading to false detections and reduced reliability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.(2023)Wang, Zhang, Qian, and Chen</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, thermal images rely on emitted radiation from objects and can capture stable images under complex conditions, albeit at lower resolutions. This capability allows for better differentiation between crack foregrounds and backgrounds in challenging environments<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Du et al.(2017)Du, Zhang, Li, and Sun</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jiang et al.(2024)Jiang, Li, Wang, Chen, and Zhang</a>]</cite>. Therefore, RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) crack segmentation has gained increased attention<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kütük and Algan(2022)</a>]</cite>. By utilizing both RGB and thermal data and efficiently fusing their complementary information, the performance and stability of crack segmentation can be enhanced across various real-world scenarios. Leveraging the rich semantic information from both modalities is essential to overcome existing challenges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Tang et al.(2022)Tang, Yuan, and Ma</a>]</cite>. Although some studies have employed both infrared and RGB images, a unified benchmark for pavement crack segmentation across these modalities is still lacking. To address this gap, we compiled existing crack segmentation approaches and hybrid methods integrating infrared and RGB data, constructing a novel and comprehensive benchmark for asphalt pavement crack segmentation. Our review identified several critical limitations in current methodologies.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key challenges in RGB-T crack segmentation is the efficient fusion of cross-modal features. Traditional convolution-based attention mechanisms—such as channel, spatial, and hybrid attention—are limited by their local receptive fields, restricting their ability to model global contextual relationships<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al.(2024)Chen, Wen, and Qin</a>]</cite>. While self-attention mechanisms can capture long-range dependencies, their high computational and memory costs make them impractical for large-scale inputs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">Shen et al.(2021)Shen, Zhang, Zhao, Yi, and Li</a>]</cite>. To address these issues, we introduce the Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module (EGTCF), which effectively captures extensive multi-scale relationships and long-range feature interdependencies between RGB and thermal modalities without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.
Another challenge lies in designing an effective framework for multi-modal feature learning and supervision. Existing RGB-T segmentation frameworks can be divided into two main types(illustrated in <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ IRFusionFormer: Enhancing Pavement Crack Segmentation with RGB-T Fusion and Topological-Based Loss" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b)</span>): the tailor-made under-fused strategy and the bi-directional middle-fusion strategy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wu et al.(2022)Wu, Chu, and Liu</a>]</cite>. The tailor-made approach integrates thermal features into RGB features within the encoder but lacks sufficient inter-modal interaction. The bi-directional middle-fusion strategy promotes interaction by allowing fused features to influence unimodal branches but struggles with supervising modality-specific learning effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision (IHBS) framework. This framework enhances modality interaction by distributing fused feature information across branches and enabling joint supervision of RGB and thermal feature learning.
Furthermore, an appropriate loss function is also critical for enhancing deep learning performance in crack segmentation models.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.(2020)Wang, Ma, Zhao, and Tian</a>]</cite>. Commonly used loss functions in crack segmentation, such as Cross Entropy Loss and Dice Loss<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jadon(2020)</a>]</cite>, focus on pixel-level prediction accuracy but often neglect the topological structure of cracks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.(2018)Wang, Zhang, Wang, Braham, and Qiu</a>]</cite>, leading to discontinuities in the segmented outputs. To remedy this, a topological-based loss function, illustrated in <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ IRFusionFormer: Enhancing Pavement Crack Segmentation with RGB-T Fusion and Topological-Based Loss" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(c)</span>, is introduced to accurately capture and preserve the crack skeleton’s intrinsic topology.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In modern image feature extraction, CNN and Transformer-based architectures serve as the primary methods.
The CNN architecture is effective in extracting local features, but due to its limited receptive field and the pooling process, it may miss some global-scale correlations.
In contrast, the Transformer architecture uses a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and global context, enabling a comprehensive understanding of semantic entities.
The proposed IHBS framework requires separate feature extraction for infrared and RGB images, followed by an interaction mechanism that enhances modality fusion and enables joint supervision.
Infrared images, sensitive to thermal characteristics, highlight areas with temperature differences, while RGB images provide detailed visual information. To achieve this, as shown in <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Overview ‣ 2 Methods ‣ IRFusionFormer: Enhancing Pavement Crack Segmentation with RGB-T Fusion and Topological-Based Loss" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a></span>, ResNet is used for infrared image feature extraction, capturing local crack information, while the Segformer network, based on Transformer technology, is employed for RGB images, capturing both local and global features. After processing through the 1st, 2nd, and 4th ResNet or Segformer decoders, the infrared and RGB images of identical size are fused via the EGTCF.The fused features are then redistributed back into their respective modality-specific branches, enhancing inter-modal interaction as part of the IHBS framework, thereby promoting a more effective modality interaction.
In the training phase, the IHBS framework employs joint supervision of RGB and thermal feature learning, while both the topological-based loss function and the infrared-based auxiliary loss function guide the segmentation training.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.15" class="ltx_p">This efficient RGB-T cross-fusion module facilitates feature interactions between parallel streams during each stage of the feature extraction process. It enables the learning of long-range dependencies from the other modality by correcting its own modal features through these interactions. Employing this methodology significantly reduces computational complexity. For instance, while a non-local module applied to a 256*256 image would require 17GB of memory, our efficient attention approach demands only 67 MB of memory.</p>

It comprises four image types: RGB images, infrared images, fused images (combined at a 50:50 ratio using IR-Fusion™ technology), and ground truth images manually annotated using Photoshop. Each category consists of 448 images, each with a resolution of 640x480 pixels. For training and evaluation purposes, the segmentation model divides the entire dataset into two subsets: 358 images for the training set and 90 images for the test set.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance the diversity of the training data and improve the model’s robustness, spatial, color, and numerical transformations were applied to the training set, such as random horizontal or vertical flips in spatial, randomly altering brightness or contrast in color. For images in the validation set, only resizing to 480×480 pixels and normalization processes were applied. The proposed IRFusionFormer was implemented using the PyTorch framework and optimized with AdamW, incorporating a weight decay of 1e-4. A batch size of 8 and 150 training epochs were designated for training. All experiments were performed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 to expedite model training.</p>

The proposed IRFusionFormer achieved the best results across all six evaluation metrics on the test dataset, outperforming the second-best model, CMNeXt, in Dice, IoU, Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, and Recall by 2.41%, 3.89%, 0.64%, 1.16%, 0.26%, and 3.62%, respectively. More importantly, infrared-integrated models were less affected by the presence of watermarks, shadows, or other disturbances on the pavement, compared to RGB-only models. These findings suggest that while infrared images alone are insufficient in isolation for accurate asphalt pavement crack segmentation, their integration with RGB images can markedly enhance prediction accuracy and reduce the impact of complex environmental factors. Additionally, as illustrated in <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure  <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Results ‣ IRFusionFormer: Enhancing Pavement Crack Segmentation with RGB-T Fusion and Topological-Based Loss" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a></span>, the proposed method provides a more complete crack skeleton, attributed to the comprehensive crack information from infrared images and the specially designed loss function that accounts for the topology of cracks and integrates auxiliary loss from infrared feature fusion.</p>

However, when the weight of the auxiliary loss function increases, the results of crack segmentation decline. Specifically, when the weight is 0.1, the results are optimal.

However, excessively high weights of the topological-based loss function lead to decreased segmentation performance. Consequently, an appropriately weighted topological-based loss function optimally enhances the model’s segmentation performance. The ablation study shows, a weight of 0.3 yields the best performance. Overall, these results demonstrate that the proposed multi-scale fusion module and appropriately weighted loss functions significantly contribute to the performance of the crack detection model.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To integrate RGB and infrared image information for segmenting asphalt pavement cracks in complex environments, we propose the RGB-T asphalt pavement crack segmentation benchmark. The benchmark includes a dataset of image pairs, a codebase comprising nine algorithms, six evaluation metrics, as well as all related results. This benchmark provided a new platform for various methods. IRFusionFormer, which was a new crack segmentation method proposed in this research, achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in the the established benchmark. In the proposed method, the Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module was incorporated into the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision (IHBS) framework, which was designed to efficiently fuse features from RGB and infrared images across three key stages. Additionally, a topological-based loss function was employed, specifically tailored to handle the topological structures of cracks, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the crack segmentation. Ablation study results demonstrated that these techniques significantly improve the performance of the IRFusionFormer network in crack segmentation tasks.</p>
