<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">With the proliferation of smart devices having built-in sensors, Internet connectivity, and programmable computation capability in the era of Internet of things (IoT), tremendous data is being generated at the network edge. Federated learning is capable of analyzing the large amount of data from a distributed set of smart devices without requiring them to upload their data to a central place. However, the commonly-used federated learning algorithm is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and not suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments due to its high communication resource requirement. Moreover, the privacy of sensitive data on smart devices has become a key concern and needs to be protected rigorously. This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called DP-PASGD for training a machine learning model efficiently from the data stored across resource-constrained smart devices in IoT while guaranteeing differential privacy. The optimal schematic design of DP-PASGD that maximizes the learning performance while satisfying the limits on resource cost and privacy loss is formulated as an optimization problem, and an approximate solution method based on the convergence analysis of DP-PASGD is developed to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Numerical results based on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed DP-PASGD scheme.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of smart devices with built-in sensors, Internet connectivity, and programmable computation capability in the era of Internet of things (IoT) leads to tremendous data being generated at the network edge. This rich data, if collected, shared, and analyzed efficiently, can power a wide range of useful IoT applications, such as personal fitness tracking<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, traffic monitoring<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and smart home security<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and renewable energy integration<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Among the available methods in analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning is the state-of-the-art and enables learning statistical models from data for detection, classification, and prediction of future events.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional machine learning works mostly in a centralized way by first uploading all data to a central location (e.g., in the cloud) and then performing model training using some powerful servers. With the growth of the computation and storage capabilities of smart devices, constrained network bandwidth, and increasing privacy concerns associated with personal data, federated learning that stores data locally and trains models distributedly on each smart device is gaining popularity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since raw data is kept locally on each device without being shared directly with the central server, federated learning can achieve higher efficiency and better privacy in comparison with centralized machine learning in IoT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the core backbone of most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, (mini-batch) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been widely used in the federated learning setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In the distributed SGD, at the beginning of each communication round, a central server first sends the current model to each of the smart devices. Then each device calculates the gradient of the loss function based on the current model and a mini-batch of its local dataset and sends it back to the server. Next, the server aggregates these gradients and updates its global model, and the process repeats. Although computationally efficient, distributed SGD often requires a very large number of communication rounds between the smart devices and central server to reach a high accurate model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which is inefficient for resource-constrained IoT devices with expensive communication connections and limited battery sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the limitation of communication efficiency, distributed SGD algorithms with periodic averaging have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The basic idea is to allow each device to perform multiple local updates to the model instead of just computing gradients and then periodically aggregate the local models. By performing more computation at smart devices between each communication round, those algorithms are shown to work well with fewer numbers of communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Since each local update consumes computation resource and each global aggregation consumes communication resource, the global aggregation period needs to be carefully chosen to balance the model accuracy and total resource consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While resource efficiency is a key concern for federated learning on IoT devices, protecting the privacy of participating users and their sensitive data is an equally important consideration. Note that the intermediate results (e.g., gradients or local models) exchanged during the federated learning process could leak private user information as demonstrated by recent attacks such as model inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and membership attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Differentially private noise can be added into the intermediate results in the distributed learning algorithms to provide rigorous privacy guarantee, but it affects the model accuracy. When jointly considering the requirements of resource efficiency and privacy, there is a complicated relationship among the model accuracy, resource cost, and privacy for federated learning in IoT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">There are several recent studies that focus on either reducing communication/computation resource usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or providing privacy guarantee <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, but not both, in federated learning. When considering resource efficiency and privacy protection simultaneously, the impacts of the learning algorithm on the above two aspects needs to jointly analyzed and optimized to obtain the optimal schematic design, which is much more challenging than only considering a single aspect. Moreover, none of the previous studies in literature have rigorously investigated the resource allocation for federated learning over resource-constrained IoT, which needs to explicitly model the communication and computation resource and privacy constraints in IoT networks and has a large impact on the learning accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above observations, in this paper we propose a novel federated learning framework called DP-PASGD that is easy to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT devices and guarantees differential privacy. The proposed framework integrates distributed SGD with periodic averaging to reduce resource cost and differentially private noise addition to preserve privacy. We then investigate the optimal configuration of DP-PASGD and propose an optimization framework to maximize the model accuracy while satisfying the limits on resource cost and privacy loss of IoT devices in DP-PASGD. Next, we develop an approximate solution approach to find the optimal configuration under the proposed framework efficiently. The problem is significant to resource-constrained IoT environments because the training of machine learning models is often resource-intensive, and a non-optimal learning scheme could quickly drain the resources of smart devices and violate users’ privacy, discouraging them to participate.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning based on SGD has been well studied in literature with both theoretical convergence analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and real-world experiments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. However, traditional distributed SGD does not fit into the IoT setting wherein the communication cost is usually high and smart devices are often resource-constrained. Recent studies have started to reduce the resource usage, particularly communication resource, in SGD-based distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Two most common approaches are (i) periodic model averaging that puts more computation on each device between each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>; and (ii) gradient compression that quantizes and/or sparsifies gradients computed by each device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, most of the proposed resource-efficient schemes ignore the privacy aspect and do not explicitly model resource constraints on smart devices. Our proposed scheme achieves both resource efficiency and rigorous privacy protection through integrating periodic model averaging and differential privacy. Moreover, we provide an optimization framework to balance the trade-offs among model accuracy, resource consumption, and privacy guarantee in the proposed scheme and solve it under practical resource and privacy constraints. Agarwal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> also proposes a distributed SGD scheme that achieves both communication-efficiency and differential privacy, but it focuses on gradient compression and hence is orthogonal to our work. Moreover, it is not clear from their scheme how to maximize learning accuracy under differential privacy and communication-efficiency constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Differentially private distributed learning is also an active research area, and a wide range of differentially private algorithms have been proposed based on different distributed optimization algorithms (e.g., alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), gradient descent, and distributed consensus) and noise addition mechanisms (e.g., output perturbation, objective perturbation, and gradient perturbation) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, none of the known privacy-preserving schemes explicitly model or optimize the resource efficiency aspect, and if applied directly to IoT, could lead to sub-optimal performance. In comparison, we perform a rigorous convergence analysis of our proposed differentially private algorithm and use it to optimize the configuration of our algorithm under different IoT settings.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although communication-efficient, PASGD does not provide rigorous privacy guarantee for the participating devices and their sensitive information. Specifically, we consider the following attack model: the cloud server and smart devices are all “honest-but-curious”, and the information exchanged through the network is secured during the transmission using standard security protocols. By observing the received local model of a victim device, it is possible for the cloud server or other devices to recover the private dataset of the victim device using reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> or infer whether a sample is in the dataset of the victim with membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Our design goal is to ensure that the cloud server or other devices cannot learn much additional information of the victim device’s dataset from the exchanged messages during the execution of the learning scheme under any auxiliary information.</p>

We first describe our experimental setup and then show the efficiency of DP-PASGD in resource-constrained settings by comparing it with a baseline. Next, we show that our approximate solution method for the optimal design of DP-PASGD is effective by comparing our derived solution with the global optimal one obtained by the brute-force method. Finally, we show the trade-offs among resource cost, privacy, and model accuracy in DP-PASGD.</p>

It is common to use the grid search to tune these hyperparameters, which needs to try all combinations of these hyperparameters on the validation set and returns the combination with the highest testing accuracy as the optimal configuration.
The grid search is a brute-force method which is costly, especially for sensitive datasets. In comparison, our approach can efficiently find the optimal configuration of DP-PASGD using the proposed optimization framework, saving both time and privacy costs in tuning the hyperparameters.
Here, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimal design approach for DP-PASGD, we compare the optimal aggregation period <math id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS3.p1.5.m5.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> calculated by our optimal design approach with the best <math id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS3.p1.6.m6.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> obtained by using the grid search.</p>

However, for the Adult-2, Vehicle-1, and Vehicle-2 cases, the testing accuracy does not significantly increase when more resources are allocated, especially when the privacy budget is low. The reason is that the models learned in those cases are more sensitive to the privacy budget. Therefore, even when we have more resources for computation and communication, the accuracy is still limited by the privacy budget.</p>

We can see that higher privacy budget usually leads to higher testing accuracy due to the decreased noise magnitude added in each iteration. However, for the Adult-1 case, the impact of the privacy budget is less significant cmpared to other data distributed cases because its model turns out to be more sensitive to the resource budget.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme, called DP-PASGD, for resource-constrained IoT. We have performed the convergence analysis of the proposed DP-PASGD and investigated the optimal configuration of DP-PASGD to maximize the model accuracy under resource and privacy limits. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and shown the trade-offs among model accuracy, resource cost, and privacy for federated learning in IoT. In future work, we plan to study the performance of DP-PASGD in other learning settings such as multi-task learning and privacy considerations such as personalized differential privacy.
