<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Vanilla federated learning does not support learning in an online environment, learning a personalized model on each client, and learning in a decentralized setting. There are existing methods extending federated learning in each of the three aspects. However, some important applications on enterprise edge servers (e.g. online item recommendation at global scale) involve the three aspects at the same time. Therefore, we propose a new learning setting <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Decentralized Personalized Online Federated Learning</span> that considers all the three aspects at the same time.</p>
<p id="id8.id2" class="ltx_p">In this new setting for learning, the first technical challenge is how to aggregate the shared model parameters from neighboring clients to obtain a personalized local model with good performance on each client. We propose to directly learn an aggregation by optimizing the performance of the local model with respect to the aggregation weights. This not only improves personalization of each local model but also helps the local model adapting to potential data shift by intelligently incorporating the right amount of information from its neighbors.
The second challenge is how to select the neighbors for each client. We propose a peer selection method based on the learned aggregation weights enabling each client to select the most helpful neighbors and reduce communication cost at the same time. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on three real-world item recommendation datasets and one air quality prediction dataset.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning, especially deep learning, requires large amounts of training data that is typically collected from user devices.
Traditionally, all user data is sent to and stored in a central server to perform model training. This practice has drawbacks in many aspects including privacy, security and latency.
In particular, user data privacy has become a major concern in many machine learning applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Considering these drawbacks of centralized data collection/model training, Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has emerged to be a popular machine learning paradigm in which user data is kept on each local client (a regional edge server or even the user device) and a global model is trained in a distributed fashion under the coordination of a central server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider federated learning on enterprise edge servers where each client is a regional edge server.
In the rest of the paper, we will refer to ”client” or ”edge server” as ”edge” following the convention in enterprise edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In this scenario, user data from one region cannot (or will not be allowed to) be shared with edge/central servers in another region due to data governance laws and regulations (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> in European Union, Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> in China, and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>), which makes federated learning an attractive learning paradigm.
However, for some applications on enterprise edges,
vanilla federated learning suffers from three limitations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, most federated learning methods are developed for offline training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this case, the whole training process happens only once or once in a while after the offline data is updated.
However, in most real-world applications, the data arrives at the edges in an online fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In applications where the data distribution does not shift over time (or shift very slowly over time), one workaround is to accumulate some online data as offline data, then train the model with federated learning once in a while.
This workaround is not feasible in applications where the data distribution can shift rapidly, in which case one has to continuously train the model in an online fashion to adapt the model to the dynamic data trends. One such application is recommendations in the fashion domain where new items/products are introduced very frequently and certain items can suddenly gain or lose in popularity due to random events (e.g. endorsement by a celebrity or scandalous news of a related company).
In these applications, both learning and inference should also be performed online whenever new data points arrive.
Specifically, the workflow is that, first
some data points arrive (e.g. online browsing activities of an user), the model performs inference (e.g. select items to recommend), and feedback is received (e.g. whether the user has clicked on the recommended items.), then the model trains on the feedback.
This process is continuously repeated online.
To the best of our knowledge, the only work in federated learning that considers the online setting is FedOMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. There are also several other methods titled ”online federated learning” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> but ”online” is meant in a different way, e.g. clients join and drop online <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The second limitation is that vanilla federated learning aims at learning a single global model. However, in the case where the edges do not have the same data distribution, using a single global model is sub-optimal and it is better to have a personalized model on each edge that is adapted specifically for the data distribution on that edge. For example, having tailored models for the edge in France and the edge in the US is beneficial because their data distribution is different due to regional differences in culture.
To counter this limitation, different approaches have been attempted including federated multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, personalized layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and meta-learning based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The third limitation is that the existence of the central parameter server (that coordinates the whole learning process) introduces a single point of failure
and regulatory risks. If the central server is down or the connection to the central server is congested, all edges will be impacted.
Furthermore, centralized parameter servers are less flexible regarding different and changing regulations. For example, some countries (e.g. China) suddenly disallow direct model parameter sharing (or limit network connection) to the country where the centralized parameter server is located (e.g. the US), then the centralized parameter server has to move to a different place to conform to the regulation. The same situation may happen multiple times, so in an extreme scenario, there might be no suitable country to host the centralized parameter server. However, this situation can be easily handled in a decentralized setting where the local edges (servers) in China can simply disable the links to the edges (servers) in the US to conform to regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">Therefore, decentralized federated learning has been considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> where each edge can directly communicate with other edges.
One challenge of decentralized federated learning is peer selection, which is important but under-explored. The motivation of peer selection is that if every edge has to exchange model parameters with every other edge, the amount of communication is <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(n^{2})" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><msup id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mn id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑂</ci><apply id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><cn type="integer" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">O(n^{2})</annotation></semantics></math> where <math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> is the number of edges.
To reduce communication cost, existing work typically use simple heuristics, e.g., by hard-coding each edge/client to communicate only with certain peers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> or randomly sampling some peers to connect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Intuitively, it would be the best if each edge/client avoids the peers that can be ”adversarial” and selects the peers that are most helpful to it, especially in the case where the edges do not have the same distribution and we want to learn a personalized model for each edge. However, peer selection strategies smarter than hard-coded rules and random sampling remain unexplored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed, there has been existing work focusing on tackling each one of the three limitations.
However, some important applications (that are at a global scale) involve all three challenges at the same time. For example, fashion/news item recommendations for users; Propensity analysis of customers performing certain actions; Personalized discount offerings; Real-time bidding of ads; Trend detection in e-commerce/social media. Each of these applications is ubiquitous in most tech companies that operate on a global scale and involves billions of users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a new setting: <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decentralized personalized online federated learning</span> to consider the three limitations at the same time. Specifically, ”decentralized”, ”personalized”, and ”online” target the three aforementioned limitations respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this setting has not yet been considered in literature. A straightforward solution for this setting is to directly combine existing methods developed specifically for each limitation, which however is infeasible as the techniques are mostly not compatible.
Therefore, we initialize the study on decentralized personalized online federated learning by proposing a simple yet effective method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To do online learning, we consider only the type of models that are trained with online stochastic gradient descent (SGD);
To perform decentralized federated learning to incorporate information from other edges, each edge periodically fetches model parameters from other edges and aggregates them with its local model. The core idea of our method is about how to perform aggregation. In existing federated learning methods, the aggregation weights are hard-coded<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. We propose to learn a set of personalized aggregation weights for each edge so that the aggregated model is personalized for the edge by allowing each edge to intelligently select the amount of information to incorporate from its neighbors. The learned aggregation weights are also dynamically adapted over time which helps each edge adapting to data shift over time.
We then further exploit the learned aggregation weights to perform intelligent peer selection where the intuition is that there is no need for one edge to communicate with another edge that would have a very small weight during aggregation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the existing work focuses on each one of the three mentioned limitations of federated learning, the most relevant work to us includes online federated learning, personalized federated learning, and decentralized federated learning. The major difference of our method from these existing methods is that we consider the three limitations at the same time.
We discuss the differences/similarities of our method from/to the existing methods in each aspect (online learning, personalized learning, and decentralized learning) in the following.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Online federated learning.</span>
To the best of our knowledge, the only work in online federated learning is FedOMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> that incorporates ideas from online learning into federated learning. FedOMD considers the case when the loss is convex or strongly convex and proposes a mirror descent based method that enjoys good regret bounds. However, most real-world applications involve non-convexity, so the application of FedOMD is limited.
There are several other works titled ”online federated learning” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> but ”online” is meant in a different way, e.g. clients join and drop online <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> or the model is first trained on online data for some time (without doing any inference) and after that the model performs inference on the successive online data (without doing any training) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, we also use online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
to train our models. However, the difference is that we follow the standard online learning setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> (as in FedOMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) where we perform inference on each batch of newly arrived data points and then receive the ground-truth feedback of the data to train the model.</p>

In our method, we similarly seek a balance between an edge and its neighboring edges during model aggregation. The differences are that firstly, in our method aggregation is done on each edge instead of the central server as we consider a decentralized setting; secondly, on each edge during aggregation we directly learn a balance (i.e. the aggregation weights for the local and neighboring models) with the upcoming local data instead of using a hyper-parameter <math id="S2.p3.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.8.m8.1a"><mi id="S2.p3.8.m8.1.1" xref="S2.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.8.m8.1b"><ci id="S2.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.8.m8.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.8.m8.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> that is difficult to tune in practice.</p>

Existing work has focused on the communication infrastructure for decentralized federated learning for example braintorrent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and
blockchain-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> or better training procedures of the models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
A key component in decentralized federated learning methods is a strategy to select peers as neighbors for each edge to communicate with (to reduce the amount of communication).
However, peer selection is an under-explored problem as existing strategies are either hard-coding (e.g. selecting one-hop neighbors only) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> or random sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Peer selection is especially important for learning personalized models, as each edge would like to avoid potential ”adversarial” peers and select the peers that are the most helpful.
In our method, we propose a peer selection strategy (that is smarter than hard-coding and random sampling) based on the learned aggregation weights.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To derive our method, we first decide on how to perform online learning. As discussed, online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is commonly used for neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S5.p2.8" class="ltx_p">For model aggregation and peer selection, we introduce an unified solution.
Our idea is to use weighted average aggregation where the aggregation weights for neighboring edges are directly learned specifically for each edge.
Each edge can then select peers with higher weights to be its selected neighbors in the next round. The workflow of our method at high level is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ IV Proposed Learning Setting ‣ Decentralized Personalized Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.11" class="ltx_p">In existing federated learning methods, aggregation weights are set with fixed heuristic rules e.g. relating to the difference of model weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> or set to be the amount of data on each edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Inutively, these fixed rules could be suboptimal.
As an example, we illustrate the suboptimality of the most commonly used method, i.e. setting weights to be the amount of data on each edge.

We can pause learning (but inference continues) for several data batches to accumulate enough data for learning the aggregation weights.
Nevertheless, minimizing the loss with respect to the current batch of data has the risk of overfitting the current batch of data. To prevent over-fitting, we learn the aggregation weights also with online gradient descent. Specifically, when we do aggregation at time stamp <math id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p6.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, we initialize the weights as the weights learned from the previous aggregation step, and then update the weights with a only few gradient descent steps.

maintain a server for broadcasting the overall topology (or connectivity) to all edges, which is allowed as no user data is involved, or one can adopt existing methods used in network routing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>

Therefore, to minimize communication cost, when fetching the model from a neighbor, each edge only fetch the embeddings for common ”ids”. In addition, in practice, most id embeddings stay unchanged between two aggregation steps, for example, the ”userid” embeddings for the users that are inactive during two aggregation steps do not change. Therefore, each edge only fetch the embeddings for the common ”ids” that are updated since the last aggregation step. This optimization reduces communication cost a lot for models like deepFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

Following prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, we adapt it to be a Clickthrough rate (CTR) prediction task by binarilizing the ratings.
Since there is no edge in this dataset, we group the dataset into ten edges/regions according to the first digit of the zipcode for each record.
We use Movielens-1m as it is the only movielens dataset that contains zip-code information.
There are 10 edges and about 1 million user-item interaction records in total. Since there is no distributional different between edges, in which case personalized model is not needed, so we inject label noise (by randomly flipping 10% of the labels) to one edge to simulate distribution shift.</p>

Our method is a wrapper method supporting aggregation of different base models on different edges. To perform experiments, we need to use a specific base model for the tasks.
For the item recommendation datasets (Dataset-A, Dataset-B, and Movielens), we use deepFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> as it is a popular method and achieves top performance on several benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. For the regression task (AirQuality) we use a Multi-layer Perception (MLP) regressor, as it is commonly used in air quality prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.</p>

We evaluate the methods based on inference performance sequentially on each batch of data.
Specifically, when a new batch of data comes on one edge, the model (deepFM or MLP) first performs prediction on which the model’s performance is evaluated (after that, the model receives and learns the ground-truth labels). We use AUC score (the area under the ROC curve) for the item recommendation datasets and 1- SMAPE score (Symmetric mean absolute percentage error <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>) for the regression dataset. For both metrics, the score value is in region [0, 1] and a higher score means better performance.</p>

This is because these dataset can have real-time data shift.
For example, for the online-store datasets (Dataset-A and Dataset-B),
some items might suddenly become popular due to trends on social media.
If there is a delay in incorporating the latest feedback into the model, there is a delay picking up the new data trend, causing lower performance.
Similarly, air quality trend can drift in real time due to sudden weather change like sudden rain and storm.
Without immediate ground-truth feedback, the model is not able to adapt to data shift as fast. On Movielens, the performance of all methods almost do not change when <math id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha_{\text{delay}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mtext id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3a.cmml">delay</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">delay</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p2.3.m3.1c">\alpha_{\text{delay}}</annotation></semantics></math> increases.

This is because each edge would have less helpful neighbors if its original most helpful neighbors happen to be chosen as the adversarial edges. Second, the performance of FedWeight and RandPS decreases significantly. This is because FedWeight is not able to adapt the weights intelligently to put less/zero weights on the adversarial edges. For RandPS, although it has the AlphaEdge’s component of learning aggregation weights, it is not exploiting the weights to select the most helpful peers, so normal edges still select the adversarial edges as neighbors, which sabotages local model performance (even though RandPS might have learned to put smaller weights on these adversarial neighbors).</p>

For all methods, as the batch size increases, the averaged score first increases and then decreases. This is because when the batch size is very small, the gradient is very noisy so that the model may deviate from the global minimum; When the batch size is very large, we have less number of gradient updates, so that the model is not optimized well.
Overall, AlphaEdge always performs better than the other methods.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a new learning setting Decentralized Personalized Online Federated Learning targeting at applications that require reliability, personalization, online learning and privacy at the same time. We identify two technical challenges in this learning setting: how to perform aggregation and how to select neighbors for each edge/client. We propose to directly learn an aggregation by optimizing the local model performance with respect to the aggregation weights, and then use the learned aggregation weights to select neighbors for each edge/client. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on four real-world item recommendation and regression datasets.</p>
