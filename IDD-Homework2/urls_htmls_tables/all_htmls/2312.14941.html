<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, for a given FL task, how to select a group of appropriate clients fairly becomes a challenging problem due to budget restrictions and client heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria client selection and scheduling scheme with a fairness guarantee, comprising two stages: 1) preliminary client pool selection, and 2) per-round client scheduling. Specifically, we first define a client selection metric informed by several criteria, such as client resources, data quality, and client behaviors. Then, we formulate the initial client pool selection problem into an optimization problem that aims to maximize the overall scores of selected clients within a given budget and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. To guarantee fairness, we further formulate the per-round client scheduling problem and propose a heuristic algorithm to divide the client pool into several subsets such that every client is selected at least once while guaranteeing that the ‘integrated’ dataset in a subset is close to an independent and identical distribution (iid). Our experimental results show that our scheme can improve the model quality especially when data are non-iid.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional machine learning, the training data are usually hosted by a centralized server (e.g., cloud server) running the learning algorithm or shared to a set of participating nodes for distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
However, in many applications, the data cannot be shared to the cloud or other participating nodes due to privacy or legal restrictions, especially when multiple organizations are involved.
Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
All parties train the model on their local datasets and send the local model updates to an aggregator, who will aggregate all the local model updates and send the global model to each client for the next round of training until converge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the privacy-preserving nature and the decentralized structure, the FL framework can be widely applied in many AI-driven applications where data are sensitive or legally restricted, such as smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, smart transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, smart finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and smart life <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, when deploying FL in these applications, it is challenging to find a group of clients who have the corresponding datasets and are willing to participate in an FL task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with this challenge, we envision an FL service provider that will provide FL as a service for different applications (e.g., FLaaS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>). In an FL service system, FL task requesters (i.e., customers) send different types of FL tasks to the FL service provider with some requirements (e.g., datasets and budgets). The FL service provider will recruit an appropriate group of clients who can satisfy the task requirements. Due to the heterogeneity of clients (including computing and communication resources, dataset size, and data quality), different clients may ask for different per-round prices for an FL task. Moreover, even if a client is selected for an FL task, it does not mean the client is able to participate in all the FL rounds because a) only a subset of clients will be selected from the client pool to participate in an individual FL round in order to reduce the communication and computation costs and b) a client may be unavailable during several FL rounds due to conflicting scheduling, out-of-battery, unstable networking environments.
This makes the client selection a challenging problem in the FL service.
Specifically, a promising client selection solution should consider both <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">initial client pool selection</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client selection in each FL round</span>
with the following requirements:</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Model Quality</span> The main goal of the client selection is to maximize the quality of the final model by selecting well-performed clients within the total budget. However, the actual performance is unknown during the initial client pool selection for an FL task. Moreover, many existing client selection algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> only focus on the per-round client selection for a given FL task.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fairness</span> The fairness consists of two parts: 1) each client who satisfied the FL task requirement has the chance to be selected into the initial client pool for an FL task; and 2) each client has a similar chance to be selected during a given FL task. Many existing client selection methods may prefer a specific type of clients (e.g., with high computing/communication resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, low non-iid data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, or high model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>), which makes it unfair for those clients whose resource or data quality may not be the best, especially for FL services. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors consider fairness during the client selection and aim to minimize the average model exchange time subjecting to long-term fairness guarantee and client availability.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria client selection and scheduling scheme with a fairness guarantee for FL service which consists of two stages: 1) selecting an initial client pool for each FL task by mapping requirements from the FL requester with the client capabilities (e.g., resources, data, previous behaviors, prices) under a given budget; and 2) selecting a subgroup of clients in each learning round of an FL task based on the data quality, model quality and behavior in previous rounds of this FL task. Specifically, the client pool will be divided into several subsets, and each subset will take turns participating in one training round. We refer to this set of rounds as one scheduling period in which all subsets have participated once. Scheduling periods are repeated until the global model converges. In each scheduling period, we compute a reputation score for each participating client according to their performance measured by model quality and behavior. Clients who are unavailable during the next scheduling period or have low reputation scores in the previous scheduling period are temporarily removed from the client pool and added back after one or a few scheduling periods.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors formulated a client selection problem to maximize the number of selected clients based on computation and communication resources when applying FL in the mobile edge computing framework. A greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the client selection problem.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, a multicriteria-based client selection approach (FedMCCS) is proposed to maximize the number of clients selected in each FL round. FedMCCS first filters the clients based on time, then uses a linear regression model to predict whether a client is able to perform the FL task based on the CPU, memory, and energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> require an extra round of communication of the resource information from clients to the server. Moreover, maximizing the number of clients selected in each FL round will output a better result and also require a higher cost. However, in FL services, the budget from an FL task request is usually limited. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a client’s successful participation probability is estimated based on the context (e.g., CPU frequency, RAM, storage, and channel information) in the current and all the previous rounds. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to select the clients within a given budget for a hierarchical FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Randomly selecting a subset of clients (e.g., FedAvg) or selecting clients based on their computing and communication resources may lead to biased results. To guarantee unbiasedness, Li <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed an unbiased sampling scheme based on a multinomial distribution (MD) where client probabilities correspond to their relative sample size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Although MD sampling can guarantee unbiasedness in expectation, it may still cause high variance in the amount of times a client is selected in a single FL iteration.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, two clustered sampling algorithms (based on sample size and model similarity) are introduced to reduce variance and keep unbiasedness during the client selection in FL.</p>

To assist client selection in FL services, we first define a comprehensive client selection metric that consists of all of these factors. Specifically,

Depending on the specific FL task, the server can choose one or more of the listed scores or add scores for additional criteria to consider in client selection. Optionally, the server can also combine two or more of the scores into one score as necessary for ease of computation or simplicity. For example, scores for CPU, GPU, MEM, storage, and power can be combined into a single score for computation resources by applying weighted sum.</p>

In this way, solving this MKP problem is equivalent to finding a group of clients such that their accumulated sample sizes for respective class labels fill the knapsacks as evenly as possible, thus minimizing non-iid degree of the selected group. MKP is a well-known NP-hard problem and there are several open-source solvers available, such as PuLP, Gurobi, and IBM CPLEX. We use IBM CPLEX to solve our instances of MKP. The main process of our subset generation algorithm is to select the first subset of clients from the input client pool by solving a MKP, and the second subset from the rest of the clients by solving another MKP, and so on untill no clients are left.</p>

As subsets are selected one by one, remaining clients become fewer, so the next subset is selected from a smaller pool. This will lead to less optimal solutions to later MKPs, which means larger non-iid degrees of subsets.

Thus, the goal becomes to find other clients to fill in available spaces of the knapsacks.

Complementary knapsacks are also used when too few clients are left, in which case we select all of them and find additional clients by complementary knapsacks.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We show that our proposed solutions for initial client pool selection and per-round client scheduling, guarantee fairness in both parts defined previously.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Each client satisfying the minimum requirements has a chance to be included in the initial client pool. This is guaranteed by the fact that clients filtered by the minimum requirements are all considered for the optimization problem (<a href="#S6.SS1" title="VI-A A Greedy Algorithm to Select the Initial Client Pool ‣ VI Proposed Solutions ‣ Multi-Criteria Client Selection and Scheduling with Fairness Guarantee for Federated Learning Service" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-A</span></span></a>). Once filtered, due to the budget limit, the chance of being selected into the pool may be different between clients. In a scenario where the cost is given by individual clients, clients with a high score-cost ratio are more likely to be selected. So, those clients whose scores are low can also increase their chances by claiming a relatively lower price. In general, the chance relies on the client’s score which is an overall score based on multiple criteria considered altogether. Thus, even if a client has a low score on some of the criteria, they can still improve the overall score by improving their scores on other criteria, thus increasing their chance of being selected.</p>

The dynamic programming (DP) algorithm gives the optimal solution of 6 clients with a total score of 36.85, the greedy algorithm selects 5 clients with a total score of 32.78 and an approximation ratio of 0.11 compared to the optimal solution, and the random selection results in 28.26 total score and 0.23 approximation ratio. From this example, it can be seen that, in terms of maximizing the total score, DP is undoubtedly the best, and the greedy algorithm outperforms random selection by achieving about 90% of the best total score. In the next experiment, we compare the time efficiencies of these three algorithms.</p>

Both algorithms are very fast but the greedy algorithm becomes slightly slower than the random as the number of clients increases, which aligns with our expectation since the greedy algorithm has a time complexity of <math id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(nlogn)" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">l</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1a" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1b" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml">g</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1c" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.6" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.6.cmml">n</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑂</ci><apply id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><times id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑙</ci><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4">𝑜</ci><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5">𝑔</ci><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.6">𝑛</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">O(nlogn)</annotation></semantics></math> and the random has that of <math id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(n)" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.3.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">n</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2"><times id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.2.2">𝑂</ci><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝑛</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS2.p3.2.m2.1c">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math> (<math id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS2.p3.3.m3.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> being the number of candidates).</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focused on how to select clients fairly and improve learning performance for FL services and proposed a multi-criteria client selection and scheduling scheme with a fairness guarantee. It consists of three stages: 1) initial client pool selection, and 2) per-round client scheduling. Specifically, we first defined a client selection metric based on multiple criteria, including client resources, data quality, and client behaviors. Then, we formulated the initial client pool selection problem into an optimization problem aiming to maximize the overall scores of the initial client pool within a given budget and proposed a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. To guarantee fairness, we further formulated the per-round client scheduling problem and proposed a heuristic algorithm to generate several subsets from the client pool, while guaranteeing that the ‘integrated’ dataset in a subset is close to a uniform distribution and every client is selected at least once to guarantee fairness. Our experimental results show that our scheme improves the model quality. In our future work, we will adjust the final payment according to the performance of the workers.</p>
