<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), the sensors such as cameras and LiDAR installed on intelligent vehicles provides higher capacity of executing computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks, thereby raising deployment costs. To address this issue, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been proposed to process data through Road Side Units (RSUs) to support real-time applications. This paper focuses on the Age of Information (AoI) as a key metric for data freshness and explores task offloading issues for vehicles under RSU communication resource constraints. We adopt a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach, allowing vehicles to autonomously make optimal data offloading decisions. However, MADRL poses risks of vehicle information leakage during communication learning and centralized training. To mitigate this, we employ a Federated Learning (FL) framework that shares model parameters instead of raw data to protect the privacy of vehicle users. Building on this, we propose an innovative distributed federated learning framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FGNN-MADRL), to optimize AoI across the system. For the first time, road scenarios are constructed as graph data structures, and a GNN-based federated learning framework is proposed, effectively combining distributed and centralized federated aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a new MADRL algorithm that simplifies decision making and enhances offloading efficiency, further reducing the decision complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach to other methods through simulations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With autonomous driving technology and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) evolving, intelligent vehicles deploy sensors like cameras and LiDAR to aid driving or achieve automation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. These technologies heighten demands for computational and storage resources, thereby posing challenges for resource-limited vehicles<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising approach to support real-time applications by enabling vehicles to offload tasks to nearby Road Side Units (RSUs), which process these tasks with their substantial computation and storage capabilities and then return the results to the vehicles<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Moreover data freshness is becoming increasingly important in VEC. Different from traditional performance metrics, the Age of Information (AoI) is a key indicator of data freshness, considering the generation time and transmission delay of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
However, as the number of vehicles or computation tasks increases, transmission interference between vehicles will greatly increase, potentially deteriorating the AoI for each vehicle’s task<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Additionally, relying on RSUs for vehicle task offloading will increase the information transmission overhead between vehicles and RSUs, and it will also degrade the AoI requirements. Therefore, distributed collaborative offloading among vehicles is crucial for optimizing the AoI in VEC.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has offered a new solution for multi-vehicle task offloading<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Each vehicle acts as an individual agent, making optimal data offloading decisions based on its observations, enabling decentralized decision-making without waiting for centralized scheduling.
However, most MADRL training currently relies on the learning model exchange communication and centralized training, where vehicles’ training and decision-making require other vehicles’ decision and state information, increasing communication bandwidth resource consumption<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Additionally, when RSUs collect all vehicle data for training, it will face the high risk of vehicle information leakage. This leads to distrust of RSUs and increases the risk of intercepting raw data, creating major bottlenecks for training models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) offers a potential solution, where vehicles can collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. This is achieved by sending model or gradients instead of raw data to RSUs, thus protecting vehicle users’ data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
By aggregating models from various vehicles, FL facilitates the sharing of knowledge and learning experiences, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate MADRL model.
However, traditional FL uses average aggregation, treating each vehicle’s contribution equally, neglecting that each vehicle may have different data features and varying contributions to model training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
In vehicular scenarios, the mobility of vehicles generates rich topological information, and each vehicle possesses unique features, such as speed, data, and the quality of model training. These personalized details can effectively enhance the generalization capability of MADRL models.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), widely applied in various domains for their ability to extract graph information<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, effectively capture features from vehicle-road graph and learn from the graph to generate FL aggregated model weights.
Currently, there is no research considering the enhancement of FL training for MADRL models using vehicle-road graphs to reduce AoI. This gap is the motivation for our work.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent studies have begun to apply GNNs in IoV.
Liu <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> proposed a Spatio-temporal Modeling And ReconsTruction (SMART) framework for assessing the feasibility of different time-delay sensitive services in large-scale IoV. This framework models the VANET as a graph by dividing the service area into subareas (nodes) connected by edges representing similar delay probabilities. SMART leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to capture spatial and temporal features of the graph, enabling the reconstruction of an updated large-scale VANET topology from limited subarea samples.
He <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a distributed spectrum sharing framework enhanced by GNN for vehicular networks. They represented the vehicular network as a graph with local observations of vehicle pairs as nodes and channel gains of interference links as edges. The GNN learns low-dimensional features of each node/vehicle pair, with each pair treated as an agent in MADRL. This approach optimizes the total capacity of the vehicular network and base station links using MADRL, with information propagated along graph edges to update each vehicle without base station support.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, He <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> addressed the challenge of task allocation in multi-scale IoV with a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based efficient task allocation scheme. They combined storage, computation, and caching mechanisms to support vehicular task distribution across multiple system scales. The dynamic system was modeled graphically, incorporating node characteristics and time IoV-varying edge relationships, using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a hybrid algorithm combining Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for task scheduling optimization.
Zhou <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> presented a computational task allocation method with demand prediction and RL for Internet of Things (IoT) environments supported by 6G technology. They used a spatial-temporal GNN-based prediction method for task demand forecasting and a simplex algorithm for cache decision-making. Additionally, they proposed a Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)-based computational task allocation method.
Liu <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a GNN and DRL-based GA-DRL algorithm for the subtask-to-vehicle assignment problem in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks within IoV. They used multi-head GAT networks to extract subtask feature information, integrating these features into Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) for decision-making.
Xiao <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> introduced a Stochastic Graph Neural Network (SGNN) and RL-based distributed stochastic decision algorithm for intelligent traffic control tasks. It tried to capture dynamic topological connectivity features of vehicles using SGNN, enabling disturbance resistance, where the SGNN is embedded in a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework with a value decomposition function for modeling vehicle relationships as random graphs.
Chen <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed a resource orchestration algorithm for vehicular cloud computing networks, abstracting the resource orchestration problem into a virtual network embedding problem. They designed a four-layer policy network based on GCN to calculate node embedding probabilities, extracting spatial structural information between nodes and neighborhoods.

They extracted wireless network topology features between vehicles using GCN, optimizing training delays to generate connection graphs. Moreover, they used the Christofides algorithm to find a minimum delay Hamiltonian circuit for model sharing.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research has explored collaborative task offloading in vehicular networks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, Lang <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a blockchain-based data sharing architecture, targeting information sharing and computational offloading in vehicular multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks. This architecture, using blockchain technology, aims to provide accurate service vehicle information to support cooperative computation offloading. To facilitate effective decision-making and data synchronization, the authors introduced a consensus mechanism combining service proof and practical Byzantine fault tolerance, along with a game theory-based offloading decision model, designed to guide user vehicles in making appropriate choices in cooperative computation offloading scenarios.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, M. Zaki <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> introduced a Cooperative Perception-based Task Offloading (CPTO) scheme, aimed at optimizing vehicular edge computing (VEC) in autonomous vehicles. CPTO focuses on maximizing vehicles’ cooperative perception capabilities and minimizing the latency of perception aggregation, adhering to specific deadlines. To achieve this, they formulated the task offloading problem as a multi-objective 0-1 integer linear programming (0-1 ILP) and proposed a greedy heuristic algorithm, CPTO-Heuristic (CPTO-H), to solve this optimization problem.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, Wang <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a novel multi-user computational offloading game method for vehicular MEC networks, adjusting the offloading probability of each vehicle. This method considers the distance between vehicles and MEC access points, application and communication models, and the competitive scenario of multiple vehicles for MEC resources, then designed a payoff function. Additionally, the authors built a distributed optimal response algorithm based on the computational offloading game model, aiming to maximize the utility of each vehicle.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, Zhou <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a method to optimize offloading decision thresholds in MEC networks, intending to maximize the expected successful offloading rate of tasks. Combining game theory analysis and constrained nonlinear optimization theory, they showed that at least one mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in the system. They formulated task offloading optimization as a Multi-Agent decision problem and developed a distributed unconstrained Lagrangian optimization (ULO) scheme based on the best response mechanism.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, Alam <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> introduced an innovative three-tier vehicular-assisted multi-access edge computing (VMEC) network design to address collaborative computational offloading issues in high-mobility vehicular network environments. This network utilizes moving and parked vehicles associated with RSUs as VMEC servers in the fog layer and proposed a strategy based on the Hungarian algorithm in Multi-Agent to find the optimal offloading strategy through collaborative agents’ actions in dynamic network environments.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, He <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> researched dynamic data offloading in urban rail transit, aiming to improve the low latency and stability issues of vehicle-to-ground communication caused by high-speed mobility. Using a software-defined network (SDN) controller, they enabled mobile users to choose MEC servers for offloading their data. To decide the specific MEC servers for mobile users’ data offloading, the authors conducted a game among mobile users and formulated an optimization problem of the user utility function to determine the optimal offloading data volume for MEC servers and maximize user utility. However, none of the above studies considered the topological structure in vehicular scenarios.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional FL involves uploading models to the RSU for global aggregation upon completion of local training. However, frequent model uploads can incur substantial communication overhead, consuming excessive bandwidth and impacting task offloading and AoI.
In addition directly employing an average FL for updating local models might overlook the unique characteristics of each vehicle’s previously trained model. This not only wastes computational resources consumed during training but also harms model personalization. Therefore, we first perform local model aggregation based on GNNs among vehicles, where GNNs are used to generate the aggregation weights by capturing the characteristics of vehicular network.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.18" class="ltx_p">In the considered scenario, due to the continuous action space of vehicle transmission power, the RL model for each vehicle employs the SAC model. Compared to DDPG, SAC shows better sample efficiency and stability. SAC introduces entropy regularization into the RL framework, encouraging exploration and achieving more robust policy learning. This is particularly beneficial in the dynamic and complex vehicular network environment. According to the SAC algorithm, the expected long-term discounted reward is calculated as</p>

Specifically, the RSU maintains a GNN network and a GNN critic network. The GNN critic network evaluates the performance of generated weights, while the GNN network improves its weight generation capability based on feedback from the GNN critic network. Moreover, for more stable target values, we introduce a target GNN critic network. Next the detailed process of the FGNN-MADRL algorithm will be explained.</p>

This is because, with decreasing speed, vehicles spend more time at nodes, allowing the GNN to more effectively extract vehicle information for training.

To reduce AoI, vehicles increase power to compete for channel resources for task offloading.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we addressed the problem of optimizing AoI in a multi-vehicle scenario. We proposed an innovative FGNN-MADRL algorithm, which integrates GNN with MADRL to optimize AoI. The key characteristic of our model is that road scenarios is first modeled as a graph and an effective FL framework that combines both distributed based on GNN and centralized federated aggregation is employed. Additionally, we introduced a MADRL algorithm designed to reduce decision complexity. Conclusions are drawn as follows:</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to other non-RL algorithms, FGNN-MADRL facilitates collaboration among vehicles, thereby reducing the average age of information. This occurs because vehicles can observe local conditions and make sensible decisions. Training models with the assistance of a GNN takes into account information from other vehicles.</p>
