<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a viable distributed learning paradigm for training a machine learning model across distributed clients without uploading raw data. However, FL in wireless networks still faces two major challenges, i.e., large communication overhead and high energy consumption, which are exacerbated by client heterogeneity in dataset sizes and wireless channels. While model quantization is effective for energy reduction, existing works ignore adapting quantization to heterogeneous clients and FL convergence. To address these challenges, this paper develops an energy optimization problem of jointly designing <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">q</span>uantization levels, scheduling <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>lients, allocating <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>hannels, and controlling computation <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">f</span>requencies (QCCF) in wireless FL. Specifically, we derive an upper bound identifying the influence of client scheduling and quantization errors on FL convergence. Under the long-term convergence constraints and wireless constraints, the problem is established and transformed into an instantaneous problem with Lyapunov optimization. Solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, our closed-form solution indicates that the doubly adaptive quantization level rises with the training process and correlates negatively with dataset sizes. Experiment results validate our theoretical results, showing that QCCF consumes less energy with faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Communication have been identified as the usage scenarios of the sixth generation mobile networks. AI algorithms are widely utilized in numerous mobile devices and play a crucial role in various aspects of life, such as AI healthcare and autonomous vehicles, thanks to leaping computation ability and increasing data storage capacity. However, traditional training of AI models requires large amounts of data, and the issue of data privacy has recently attracted widespread public attention. As a distributed training paradigm, federated learning (FL) has been proposed by Google in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Unlike centralized learning, a server shares a model, and distributed clients collaboratively train the shared model without any raw data exchange in FL, which preserves data privacy of clients. Also, FL can be integrated with existing techniques, for instance, differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to enhance security.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the pervasive and scalable connectivity of wireless networks, FL is integrated with wireless networks, in which the server and clients exchange models through downlink and uplink. Different from the adequately resourced server, energy consumption in wireless FL is considerable for clients. Furthermore, a stringent latency requirement for each communication round compels clients to increase the computation frequency and uplink power to accomplish computation and communication in time, leading to more energy consumption. Among clients, moreover, heterogeneity in energy arrivals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, mobilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and dataset sizes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is also common in wireless FL. Different dataset sizes, as the focus of this article, make the allocation of identical resources to each client impact client participating and waste energy in vain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned dilemma, several lightweight methods for the model have been proposed to ease the burden of computation and communication. For instance, model pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> sets unnecessary parameters of the model to zero, and model distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> allows clients to train simple student models under the guidance of a complex teacher model. Also, model partition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> divides the model into two parts, with one part in the client and the other in the server. These methods effectively reduce the model size, leading to energy savings and latency reduction. In addition to the above methods, quantization is also validated for reducing energy consumption. It quantizes parameters of models or updates with fewer bits, without additional knowledge such as masks of pruning or the teacher model, nor other steps like loss propagation between divided models. However, the attendant quantization error has an impact on FL convergence. In this context, to adapt to both the convergent training process and heterogeneous clients with different dataset sizes, our doubly adaptive quantization for wireless FL is proposed.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of energy optimization has spurred various efforts that schedule clients and allocate resources such as central processing unit (CPU) frequencies, transmitting power, and channels. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> controlled the number of participating clients in subsequent communication rounds based on the accuracy of the current aggregated global model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> scheduled clients based on their energy efficient ratios. Whereas, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> only focused on FL and overlooked concrete wireless scenes. Based on this point, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> focused on the non-orthogonal multiple access system, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> considered the probabilistic outage of channels. Unfortunately, high transmitting power or CPU frequencies decided by resource allocation methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> still consume enormous energy with unchanged communication overhead and cannot alleviate the heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Now we turn to the model quantization. There are many quantization methods integrated with FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. With the lowest quantization level, binary neural networks were applied in the FL framework and the corresponding convergence was derived in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. And with a higher quantization level, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a quantization knob choosing method for the fixed-point quantization. Consisting of mantissa and exponent, the block floating point quantization method is utilized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> mapped a local model to a bit sequence according to an encoding matrix and reconstructed the model in the server. In addition to the aforementioned quantization methods, other lightweight methods can also be synergistically combined. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, model pruning and quantization were applied before and after local updates, respectively. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> employed a combination of model distillation and soft quantization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The above works broadened the scope of applying model quantization in FL. Notwithstanding, the majority of follow-up works adopted a fixed quantization level rather than a varying quantization level, which has the full potential of communication overhead reduction and energy savings due to the varying tolerance of the model for quantization errors in the whole process. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a rising quantization level with the training process according to its derived optimal quantization level. On the contrary, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the quantization level was determined by the L-<math id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\infty" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∞</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><infinity id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"></infinity></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">\infty</annotation></semantics></math> norm of local updates and was decreased with the training process. In essence, whether the quantization level rises or descends, it is evident that an appropriate quantization level depends on the current model and varies with the training process. With uploading local updates, a criterion about quantization levels was established to schedule clients in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> both ignored wireless constraints and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> even set 70-second latency for each communication round, which deviates significantly from real latency over wireless networks. After all, it is wireless constraints that aggravate the impact of the heterogeneity. Without a specific quantization design for clients, the timeout or high energy consumption of clients with large datasets cannot completely be removed by simply adapting the quantization level to the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, it becomes imperative for the quantization level to adapt to clients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, different criteria of quantization levels were designed for different clients. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> adopted time-client-adaptive quantization levels, anchored in the global loss function value and incrementally adjusted according to local dataset sizes. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> applied an adaptive model quantization method in both computation and communication. Regrettably, despite the insightful analyses of FL performance in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, wireless constraints and energy consumption were largely overlooked. Hence, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> defined the excess risk of the channel and the mean-square deviation to design an adaptive quantization level. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> transformed local gradients into correlated Gaussian random variables which were adaptively quantized, and controlled the communication rate accordingly. Notwithstanding, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> focused on different communication rates among clients and gave no adaption to different sizes due to the same-size dataset setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To sum up, none of the previous works provides insights into the relationships of the quantization level with both the training process and different dataset sizes, i.e., doubly adaptive quantization. Additionally, an integration of doubly adaptive quantization and methods about resource allocation and client scheduling over wireless networks is notably absent. Hence, there is no energy-efficient wireless FL framework under this condition yet.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p15.1" class="ltx_p">If varying channel responses are neglected, the two remarks are consistent with demands in wireless FL. Specifically, a low quantization level leads to a high quantization error which has a small impact due to inherent fluctuation in early communication rounds. When the model tends to the convergence, a high quantization level reduces the quantization error to avoid fluctuation. Under communication constraints, computation on a large dataset takes much latency, and the client decreases quantization levels to shorten communication latency for compensation.</p>

It can be noticed that the principle algorithm, the same-size algorithm, and our QCCF algorithm all increase the quantization level with the training process. And the final quantization level of the principle algorithm is larger than the other two. The underlying reason is that the principle algorithm blindly keeps the quantization level rising and leads to clients dropping out, which not only consumes more energy but also achieves poor performance. As for the channel-allocate algorithm, there are no significant differences in quantization levels in all communication rounds. This result is rather intuitive since the quantization level of the channel-allocate algorithm only relies on channel states, which follow the same distribution in different communication rounds.</p>

It attributes to the fact that these two algorithms consider both the latency constraint and different dataset sizes among clients. The same-size algorithm ignores the latter so that its quantization level is unrelated to dataset sizes. And according to the quantization principle of the principle algorithm, the quantization level is proportional to the dataset size, which can be validated by Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-D Analysis of Quantization Level ‣ VI Experiment Results ‣ Energy-Efficient Wireless Federated Learning via Doubly Adaptive Quantization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b).</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has proposed a novel approach to reduce energy consumption in wireless FL with the adaption of the quantization level to both the training process and different dataset sizes of clients. First, we have developed an FL framework with client scheduling and the doubly adaptive quantization level. To ensure the convergence of our FL framework, we have derived an upper bound with the quantization error part and the data property part. These two parts and other wireless settings have served as constraints. And a long-term optimization problem has been formulated to minimize total energy consumption by designing quantization levels, scheduling clients, allocating channels, and controlling CPU frequencies. Through Lyapunov optimization, the long-term problem has been transformed into an instantaneous problem, which can be decomposed into two subproblems and solved by KKT conditions and the genetic algorithm. The closed-form solution has suggested that the doubly adaptive quantization level should rise with the training process and be negatively correlated with dataset sizes, which has been validated in later experiments.
