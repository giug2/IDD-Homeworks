<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We consider the federated learning problem where data on workers are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). During the learning process, an unknown number of Byzantine workers may send malicious messages to the central node, leading to remarkable learning error. Most of the Byzantine-robust methods address this issue by using robust aggregation rules to aggregate the received messages, but rely on the assumption that all the regular workers have i.i.d. data, which is not the case in many federated learning applications. In light of the significance of reducing stochastic gradient noise for mitigating the effect of Byzantine attacks, we use a resampling strategy to reduce the impact of both inner variation (that describes the sample heterogeneity on every regular worker) and outer variation (that describes the sample heterogeneity among the regular workers), along with a stochastic average gradient algorithm to gradually eliminate the inner variation. The variance-reduced messages are then aggregated with a robust geometric median operator. We prove that the proposed method reaches a neighborhood of the optimal solution at a linear convergence rate and the learning error is determined by the number of Byzantine workers. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in the non-i.i.d. setting.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid increase of data volume and computing power, the past decades have witnessed the explosive development of machine learning. However, many machine learning methods require a central server or a cloud to collect data from various owners and train models in a centralized manner, leading to serious privacy concerns. To address this issue, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> keeps data private at their owners and carries out machine learning tasks locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Every data owner (called worker thereafter) performs local computation based on its local data and sends the results (such as local models, gradients, stochastic gradients, etc) to the central server. The central server (called central node thereafter) aggregates the results received from the workers and updates the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the distributed nature of federated learning makes it vulnerable to attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Due to the heterogeneity of federated learning systems, workers are not all reliable. Some workers might be malfunctioning or even adversarial, and send malicious messages to the central node. This paper considers the classical Byzantine attack model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, where an unknown number of Byzantine workers are omniscient, collude with each other, and send arbitrary malicious messages. Moreover, the identities of Byzantine workers are unknown to the central node. Misled by the Byzantine workers, the aggregation at the central node is problematic, such that the federated learning method may converge to an unsatisfactory model or even diverge. For instance, the popular distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method fails at presence of Byzantine attacks from a single worker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the Byzantine-robust distributed methods modify distributed SGD to handle Byzantine attacks, by replacing mean aggregation with robust aggregation at the central node <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. When the data on the workers are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and the local cost functions are in the same form, stochastic gradients computed at the same point are i.i.d. too. Therefore, various robust aggregation rules, such as geometric median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, can be applied to alleviate the effect of statistically biased messages sent by Byzantine workers. Unfortunately, the data on the workers are often non-i.i.d. in federated learning applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Thus, the messages sent by the regular workers are no longer i.i.d. such that handling Byzantine attacks becomes more challenging.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, in a nutshell, belongs to the category of distributed optimization, for which there are extensive works, ranging from machine learning, signal processing to system control. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposes a projected primal-dual method to solve the distributed constrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem.

Below we focus on the related works in Byzantine-robustness of distributed algorithms, especially those handling non-i.i.d. data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Byzantine-robust distributed machine learning has attracted much attention in recent years. In distributed SGD, the central node aggregates messages received from the workers by taking average and uses the mean as aggregated gradient direction. The mean aggregation, however, is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks. Existing Byzantine-robust distributed methods mostly extend the distributed SGD with robust aggregation rules, such as geometric median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, normalized aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, coordinate-wise median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, coordinate-wise trimmed mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, to name a few. Algorithms leveraging second-order information has also be considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Another approach is to detect and discard outliers from the received messages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. When the received stochastic gradients from the regular workers satisfy the i.i.d. assumption, the statistically different malicious messages from the Byzantine workers can be detected and discarded, or their negative effect can be alleviated by robust aggregation rules. For network anomaly detection in distributed online optimization, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes a distributed one-class support vector machine method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Aiming at Byzantine-robustness with distributed non-i.i.d. data, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposes a robust stochastic aggregation method that employs model aggregation rather than stochastic gradient aggregation. Forced by the introduced consensus constraints, the regular workers and the central node shall reach consensus on their local models, no matter the local data are i.i.d. or not. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> also imposes asymptotic consensus between the regular workers and the central node, and proposes a Byzantine-robust proximal stochastic gradient method. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> divides the cost functions of the workers into several clusters, such that within each cluster the i.i.d. assumption approximately holds. Then robust aggregation can be applied within each cluster. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduces a resampling strategy to reduce the heterogeneity of the received messages in the non-i.i.d. setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, variance of the messages sent by the regular workers plays a critical role to Byzantine-robustness. Larger variance means that the malicious messages are harder to distinguish. Theoretically, the variance can be classified into inner variation that describes the sample heterogeneity on every regular worker and outer variation that describes the sample heterogeneity among the regular workers. In the i.i.d. setting the inner variation often dominates, while in the non-i.i.d. setting the outer variation can be large. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and its extended version <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> use SAGA to correct the stochastic gradients and aggregate the corrected stochastic gradients with geometric median. It has been proven that the impact of inner variation is fully eliminated from the learning error. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> combines stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) with robust aggregation to solve distributed non-convex problems. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proves that the momentum method can reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients for the regular workers relative to their norm, and is thus helpful to Byzantine-robustness. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> also claims that applying the momentum method can reduce the variance and enhance Byzantine-robustness. The resampling strategy used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is able to reduce the impact of inner and outer variations simultaneously.</p>

First, the theme of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is to investigate the importance of variance reduction to Byzantine-robustness for i.i.d. data, while this work considers non-i.i.d. data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> studies reducing the impact of inner and outer variations by resampling, but is unable to eliminate the impact of inner variation.

The first term now refers to the cross-sample variance (a.k.a. inner variation), while the second term refers to the cross-worker variance (a.k.a. outer variation). When either the inner variation or the outer variation is large, the geometric median aggregation yields a poor direction that eventually leads to large learning error, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II Problem Formulation and Preliminaries ‣ Byzantine-Robust Variance-Reduced Federated Learning over Distributed Non-i.i.d.

However, for the non-i.i.d. case, the second term at the right-hand side of (<a href="#S2.E7" title="In Property 1. ‣ II Problem Formulation and Preliminaries ‣ Byzantine-Robust Variance-Reduced Federated Learning over Distributed Non-i.i.d.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the fact that the messages with large variance affect the robust aggregation performance, we propose to <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">simultaneously reduce the inner and outer variations</em> so as to achieve better performance in the non-i.i.d. setting. Specifically, we use the variance-reduced stochastic gradients at the worker side to gradually eliminate the inner variation, and use a resample-then-aggregate strategy at the central node to reduce outer variation.</p>

We handle the variance of resampled vectors from two aspects, namely, the mean-square error between resampled vectors and original vectors and that between original vectors and averaged vector.

Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, our proposed method is able to achieve the classification accuracy of around 0.73. RS-Byrd-SGD also demonstrates robustness since the resampling strategy helps reduce the impact of both inner and outer variations. However, as we have shown in the theoretical analysis, solely using resampling is unable to fully eliminate the inner variation. In contrast, the proposed method introduces SAGA to address this issue, yielding enhanced classification accuracy. RSA works well since it is developed to handle the non-i.i.d. case. The other Byzantine-robust methods, Byrd-SGD, Krum and Byrd-SAGA, all show degraded performance since they are essentially designed for distributed i.i.d. data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We develop a Byzantine-robust variance-reduced method to deal with the federated learning problem with distributed non-i.i.d. data. To reduce the impact of stochastic gradient noise that hinders the resistance to Byzantine attacks, we adopt the resampling strategy and SAGA to reduce the outer variation and fully eliminate the inner variation. The variance-reduced messages are then aggregated by geometric median. Theoretical results show that the proposed method can reach a neighborhood of the optimal solution with linear convergence rate and the learning error is determined by the number of Byzantine workers. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method. In the future work, we will investigate the elimination of outer variation, and the combination of variance-reduced methods with other robust aggregation rules.</p>
