<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a popular approach to facilitate privacy-aware machine learning since it allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without granting others access to their private data. It is, however, known that FL can be vulnerable to <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">membership inference attacks</span> (MIAs), where the training records of the global model can be distinguished from the testing records. Surprisingly, research focusing on the investigation of the source inference problem appears to be lacking. We also observe that identifying a training record’s source client can result in privacy breaches extending beyond MIAs. For example, consider an FL application where multiple hospitals jointly train a COVID-19 diagnosis model, membership inference attackers can identify the medical records that have been used for training, and any additional identification of the source hospital can result the patient from the particular hospital more prone to discrimination. Seeking to contribute to the literature gap, we take the first step to investigate source privacy in FL. Specifically, we propose a new inference attack (hereafter referred to as <span id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">source inference attack</span> – SIA), designed to facilitate an honest-but-curious server to identify the training record’s source client. The proposed SIAs leverage the Bayesian theorem to allow the server to implement the attack in a non-intrusive manner without deviating from the defined FL protocol. We then evaluate SIAs in three different FL frameworks to show that in existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or predictions on a public dataset will leak such source information to the server. We also conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to investigate the key factors in an SIA. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed SIAs, e.g., an attack success rate of 67.1% (baseline 10%) can be achieved when the clients share model parameters with the server. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that the success of an SIA is directly related to the overfitting of the local models.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent deep learning advances have partly contributed to the building of powerful machine learning (ML) models from large datasets. In practice, however, data often resides across different organizational entities (also referred to as data islands). The data records of a single entity, perhaps with the exception of extremely large technology organizations, are generally limited and do not represent the entire data distribution. Thus, stakeholders (e.g., consumers) can generally benefit if different data owners can collaboratively train a joint machine learning model based on the union of different datasets. For example, our society will benefit if different countries and organizations can collaborate to collaboratively train COVID-19 diagnosis models using the broad range of medical data records in these different entities. The exacting privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> in the European Union and CCPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> in the United States), however, complicate such collaborative efforts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is one approach that can be utilized to circumvent the limitations due to data islands, by allowing multiple clients coordinated by a central server to train a joint ML model in an iterative manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In FL, the clients send their model updates to the server but never their raw training dataset, thereby leading to a privacy-aware paradigm for collaborative model training. For the example mentioned above, FL can greatly facilitate the hospitals wishing to train a joint COVID-19 diagnosis model from the distributed data in different hospitals. A real-life case in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has shown the successful adoption of FL where an ML model for COVID-19 diagnosis has been trained with the usage of the geographically distributed chest computed tomography data collected from different patients at different hospitals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, many recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have shown that FL does not provide sufficient privacy
guarantees, because sensitive information from the training data can still be revealed during the communication process. In FL, the clients transmit necessary information from updates, e.g., gradients, to the central server for global model training. Because the updates are derived from the clients’ private training data, there are several recently proposed privacy attacks trying to infer the privacy of the clients from such updates, such as data reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, property inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, preference profiling attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and membership inference attacks (MIAs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Among such attacks, MIAs aim to identify whether or not a data record was in the training dataset of a target model (i.e., a member). While an MIA seems like a simple attack, it can impose severe privacy risks in many settings where knowing that someone was in a dataset is harmful <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. For example, by identifying the fact that a clinical record was in the training dataset of a medical model associated with a certain disease, MIAs enable an attacker to know that the owner of the clinical record has a high chance of having the disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the training data of the FL system consist of all the training records in the datasets of the clients because they collaboratively build a global federated model. Thus, MIAs of existing research in the context of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> are designed to distinguish the training records from the testing records of the global model, i.e., they do not require to identify which client owns a training record, i.e., the source of the training record. However, it is important and practical to explore source privacy in FL beyond membership privacy because the leakage of the source information can further breach privacy. For example, in the previously mentioned FL application where multiple hospitals jointly train a COVID-19 diagnosis model, MIAs can only tell who has had a COVID-19 test, but the further identification of the source hospital of the people could make them more prone to discrimination, especially when the hospital is located in a high-risk region or country <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Other types of attacks in FL such as property inference attacks also fail to explore the source privacy of clients because they are either designed to infer other types of private information or the private information inferred does not attribute to a specific client. For example, property inference attacks in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> can infer a certain property in the training data but can not attribute the property to the client who owns this property.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel inference attack, named <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Source Inference Attack</span> (SIA), that determines which client in FL owns a training record. The SIA can be considered a stronger attack based on the foundation of MIAs, i.e., after identifying which data records are training records via MIAs, the attacker further implements SIAs to determine which client a training record comes from. For practical reasons, we consider the server can be a semi-honest (honest-but-curious) attacker who passively tries to learn the secret based on the information on the identities of clients and communications between them. Specifically, the semi-honest server means that the server tries to infer the private information of the clients without interfering with the federated training, i.e., without deviating from the defined FL protocol, which is the main challenge of SIAs. Note that the attacker can be one of the clients, but we argue that it is impractical in this case for SIAs because the client does not know the identities of the other clients, and it can only access the global model via communications to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We leverage the Bayesian theorem to analyze how to effectively implement SIAs in FL. We demonstrate that an honest-but-curious server can estimate the source of a training record in an SIA by leveraging the prediction loss of the local models. More specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that the client with the smallest prediction loss on the training record should have the highest probability of owning it. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed SIAs to different FL frameworks, we propose three <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FL-Sia</span> frameworks that enable the server to conduct the SIAs in three FL frameworks, FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The purpose of selecting the three FL frameworks is to show that in existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or predictions on a public dataset will lead to source information leakage to the server. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets and different model architectures under various FL settings to evaluate the effectiveness of SIAs. The experiment results validate the efficacy of our proposed SIAs. We conduct a detailed ablation study to investigate how data distributions across the clients and the number of local epochs in FL affect the performance of an SIA. An important finding is that the success of an SIA is directly related to the overfitting of the local models, which is mainly caused by the non-IID data distribution across the clients.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Because data usually exists in the form of isolated islands and central storage is impractical due to privacy regulations and laws, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to allow multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model in an interactive manner. During the training phase of FL, the clients send necessary information of the updates but never their private datasets to the central server. Because the updates contain less information than the raw training data, FL has obvious privacy advantages compared to data center training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

Horizontal FL, aka. cross-device FL, describes FL scenarios where the local datasets share the same feature space but are different in samples. An example of horizontal FL is multiple regional banks having different users from their respective regions, while the feature spaces of such users are the same because the banks have very similar businesses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Vertical FL, aka. cross-silo FL, describes FL scenarios where the local datasets share the same or similar sample ID space but differ in feature space. An example of vertical FL is two different commercial companies in the same city having the same or very similar customers in the area. However, due to different business modes, the commercial company of the bank has the user’s revenue and expenditure transactions, while the commercial company of e-commerce owns the user’s browsing and purchasing history. Vertical FL enables the two different companies to jointly build a model for predicting users’ living behaviors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

In FL with a homogeneous architecture, the local models have the same architecture as the global model, and there are two forms of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>: i) FedSGD, in which each of the clients sends gradients calculated on its local data to the server; ii) FedAvg, in which each of the clients sends the calculated local models’ parameters to the server. FedSGD has the advantage of convergence guarantees of the global model but requires frequent communication between the clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. FedAvg is more communication efficient but the global model may not perform well when the training data across the clients are highly non-identically distributed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In FL with a heterogeneous architecture, the local models do not have to share the same architecture as the global model, while each client can still benefit during the federated training process. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> (Federated Model Distillation) is a novel FL framework with a heterogeneous architecture, which shares the knowledge of each client’s local model via their predictions on an unlabeled public dataset instead of the local model’s parameters. Compared to FedAvg, FedMD eliminates the risk of white-box inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and has the advantage of reduced communication costs.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Note that there are many other FL frameworks such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and Cronus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that are proposed to solve different challenges in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These frameworks can be divided into the categories of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL we introduced above based on their architectures. They differ from the FL frameworks of FedSGD, FedAvg, and FedMD in how the local models or the global model is trained, but the information exchange between the clients and the server is the same as the three FL frameworks, i.e., the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or predictions on an unlabeled dataset to the server. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of SIAs in the three FL frameworks of FedSGD, FedAvg, and FedMD to demonstrate that an <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">honest-but-curious</span> server in FL can infer source information of the training records, no matter what kind of updates are uploaded by the clients. But it is worth noting that SIAs are also effective in other FL frameworks because their communication exchange between the clients and the server is the same as the FL frameworks we evaluated in this paper.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to identify whether or not a data record was in the training dataset of a target model. Although an MIA seems like a simple attack, it can directly lead to severe privacy breaches of individuals. For instance, identifying that a patient’s clinical record was used to train a model associated with a disease can reveal that the patient has this disease with a high chance. Although FL has emerged as a popular privacy-aware learning paradigm, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> have demonstrated the success of MIAs on FL models. For instance, Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> show that a malicious client in FL can infer whether or not a location profile was in the FourSquare dataset that was used to train the global model. In FL, because the training dataset of the FL system consists of all the local training data records, the existing research of MIAs are designed to infer whether or not a data record was used to train the global model, but not to identify whether a data record was used to train a
local model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, there are no attacks in FL to explore which client (i.e., the source) owns the training records identified by MIAs, while it is important and practical to explore the source information of the training records. For instance, in a promising FL application where multiple hospitals jointly train a COVID-19 model for COVID-19 diagnosis, an attacker can implement MIAs to infer who has been tested for COVID-19, but further identification of the source hospital where the people are from will make them more prone to discrimination, especially when the hospital is in a high-risk region or country <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we propose SIAs to show the feasibility of breaching the source privacy of the training records in FL. Our proposed SIAs shed new light on how FL reveals sensitive information and the necessity to build more private FL frameworks.</p>

During the attack process, the server follows the training protocol of the FL system but will passively try to learn the secret by mounting the SIAs. The server can acquire the communication updates uploaded by the local clients. Finally, based on the communication updates, the server can acquire the source information. There is a possibility that the attacker can be one of the clients. However, because local clients in FL can only observe the global model parameters while having little information about the identities of other clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, it is almost impossible for a local client to achieve the attack goal (detailed in the following paragraph).</p>

A motivating example is the FL application of multiple hospitals training a COVID-19 diagnosis model (see Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Source Inference Attacks: Beyond Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Membership Inference Attacks ‣ 2 Preliminaries ‣ Source Inference Attacks: Beyond Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>). Another example is the FL application of multiple users collaboratively training an image classification model. If an attacker can identify which user owns a sensitive image, the attacker can directly obtain the user’s privacy based on the sensitive content of that image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

This motivates us to design the source inference attack that the client whose local model has the smallest loss on a target record should own this record. Moreover, if the client’s local model’s behavior on its local training data is different from that of other clients, our attack will always achieve better performance than randomly guessing.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate SIAs in three FL frameworks under horizontal FL. Specifically, we investigate SIAs in FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> where local clients upload gradients, model parameters, or predictions on an unlabeled dataset to the server. The success of SIAs in the three FL frameworks sheds light on how the communications between clients and the semi-honest central server in existing FL frameworks enable the server to mount SIAs to steal source information. Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2 Source Inference Attack Method ‣ 3 Source Inference Attacks ‣ Source Inference Attacks: Beyond Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows an overview of how the honest-but-curious server implements SIAs in FL.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, the server in FedAvg can directly conduct an SIA in each communication round because it receives the parameters of local models from the clients. Thus, the server can directly use the local models to calculate the prediction loss of a target record for implementing source inference. However, in FedSGD and FedMD, the server cannot directly implement SIAs because it cannot directly leverage the updates from the clients to calculate the prediction loss of the local models on the target records. In these two frameworks, we introduce two strategies to enable the server to implement the proposed SIAs.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In FedMD, the server can leverage knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> to achieve SIAs. Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge of larger models to smaller models so that the smaller models are as accurate as larger models. The larger models are referred to as teacher models and the smaller models are referred to as students models. During knowledge distillation, the student model is trained to match the logits of the teacher model for learning its knowledge. Knowledge distillation enables the smaller student model to have similar performance to their teacher models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. In FedMD, the server cannot directly use the updates from the clients to calculate the prediction loss of the target records because the updates are predictions of a public dataset. However, because the clients’ predictions on the public dataset represent the knowledge of the local models, the server can leverage knowledge distillation to mount SIAs. Specifically, for each of the local clients, the server considers it as a teacher and leverages its predictions to train a student model to mimic the local model. Because the student models are expected to behave similarly to the local models, the server can use the prediction loss of the student models on the target records as the estimate of the prediction loss of the local models. Thus, based on the estimated prediction loss, the semi-honest server can mount SIAs in FedMD. Note that although the student models mimic the local models, there is a bias between the estimated prediction loss and the actual loss of the local model. However, if the estimated prediction loss of the client owning the target instance is distinguishable from the estimated losses of other clients, the SIAs can still succeed, which we will show in the experiments.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we empirically evaluate <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedSGD-SIA</span>, <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedAvg-SIA</span>, and <span id="S4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedMD-SIA</span>. We first introduce datasets and model architectures used in the experiments. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SIAs in the three FL frameworks and conduct a detailed ablation study to identify how different factors in FL influences the performance of SIAs. In the end, we discuss why our SIAs work.</p>

Intuitively, if a client trains the local model with more epochs, the local updated model should better remember the information of the local dataset and be more confident to classify its training records. Accordingly, the prediction loss of a target record calculated from the update of the source client will be much smaller than that calculated from the updates of other clients, which will be beneficial for SIAs.</p>

For example, for the CIFAR-10 task, a client is highly likely to have training records from only one class (<span id="S4.SS5.p2.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</span> deer) when the degree of the non-IID data distribution is high. It is expected that such a client’s local model will perform well in predicting its own records of deer images but perform badly in predicting the other clients’ records such as dogs and trucks because the local model had never seen such images during the update process. Thus, the local model will have very small prediction losses on its own records and large losses on the other records. The distinguishable prediction losses across different local models of the clients enable the server to easily implement SIAs to infer where a training record comes from.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning models especially DNNs are usually overparameterized with high complexity. This enables DNNs to learn patterns effectively from the training data on one side while on the other side such models can have unnecessarily high capacities to memorize the details of the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, which can lead to the overfitting of ML models. An overfitted ML model cannot generalize well on its test data, i.e., the model performs much better on its training data than test data. In FL, the local dataset of a client often has a limited number of records and fails to represent the whole data distribution, which exacerbates the overfitting of local models. An overfitted local model of a client is expected to have a much smaller prediction loss on a training record of its own than the loss of a training record of other clients. The distinguishable prediction losses of the local models of the different clients enable our proposed SIAs to work effectively. Moreover, the more overfitted the local models are, the more effective the SIAs will be.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the overfitting of the local models directly contributes to the success of SIAs, while overfitting is mainly caused by the non-IID data distribution across the clients. In FL, if the local dataset fails to represent the overall data distribution, the local model can easily overfit to the local training dataset, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.5 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Source Inference Attacks: Beyond Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Because an overfitted local model cannot generalize well to the data beyond its local training records, it will behave differently on its training data from other clients’ data, which guarantees the feasibility of SIAs. Many recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> have shown that the non-IID data distribution has brought important challenges to FL such as model convergence guarantees. In this paper, we demonstrate another challenge of non-IID from the perspective of privacy: The leakage of source privacy about the training data.</p>

<div id="S4.SS6.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.p7.1" class="ltx_p">There are several promising applications where SIAs can be applied. First, as a newly proposed inference attack, SIAs can be leveraged to evaluate the privacy-preserving ability of an FL framework. A strong privacy-aware FL framework should guarantee the source privacy of the clients. Second, because no defense methods have been specifically proposed for mitigating SIAs, they can inspire researchers to propose novel defense methods or design new FL frameworks for protecting clients’ source privacy. Last, we have identified that the overfitting of an FL framework is the main success factor for SIAs. Thus, SIAs can be used to help evaluate and understand the overfitting phenomenon of FL frameworks. For example, SIAs can be used to determine how many local epochs a local model should update to avoid overfitting.</p>

When an ML model is trained with differential privacy guarantees, the learned model is expected not to learn or remember any specific data details. By definition, if the local models in FL are differentially private, the success probability of SIAs should be reduced because the communication updates calculated from such models should contain less information about the local training datasets.

This FL scenario corresponds to federated to business mode where a handful of organizations jointly build a useful model, e.g., a small number of banks collaboratively build a fraud detection model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.

Class-wise data reconstruction attacks are usually achieved by GANs techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite> that leverage the model updates as discriminators to generate generic representations of class-wise data records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Instance-wise data reconstruction attacks leverage optimization techniques to iteratively optimize a dummy data record with a label so that the gradients on the dummy record are close to the gradients uploaded from a client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>.

Feature inference attacks leverage the solving of mathematical equality for simple models such as logistic regression because the prediction output and the input containing the target features can be constructed as a set of equations. For complex models such as neural networks, a generative regression network is trained through an optimization process and is leveraged to compute the target features. Recently, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite> demonstrates that feature inference attacks can also reconstruct the private input on centralized trained models based their explanation values of predictions. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite> shows that an adversary having an auxiliary dataset and black-box access to the model can successfully attack popular Machine Learning as a Service platforms such as Google Cloud and IBM aix360.</p>

The attack intuition is the sensitivity of gradients during the FL training reflects the sample size of a class: a small gradient change indicates the sample size of a class is large. The statistical heterogeneity in FL amplifies the gradient sensitivity across classes and thus benefits the preference profiling attacks.</p>

MIAs are usually achieved by training a binary classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> or leveraging a threshold of a metric such as prediction confidence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> and prediction entropy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> to decide whether a data record is training data or not. Recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>, <a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite> have shown that many different types of model such as semantic segmentation models, text-to-image generation models, graph neural networks, multi-modal models, and recommender systems are vulnerable to MIAs. Currently, most studies of MIAs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>, <a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>, <a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite> are investigated under centralized settings where one dataset containing all training instances is used for training the models.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of FL, MIAs were first investigated in FedSGD where a malicious client or server can infer whether or not a specific location profile was used for federated training based on the observation of the non-zero gradients of the embedding layer of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Then, MIAs are investigated in FedAvg where a malicious client can passively infer the membership privacy of the FL system or actively craft her updated model parameters to steal more membership privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, because the purpose of MIAs is to distinguish training data from testing data of the FL system, the existing research of MIAs ignores exploring the source client of the training data. In this paper, we propose SIAs to fill this gap and demonstrate SIAs are effective in different FL frameworks.</p>

However, HE and SMC are computationally expensive that increase substantial additional communication and computation overheads in the FL system, which may prevent clients with limited computing resources and bandwidth from participating in FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

Compared to cryptography-based methods, DP is more computationally efficient, adding noise directly to the private data to trade off privacy and utility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Existing works of privacy-preserving FL mainly focus on either the centralized DP mechanism that requires a trusted central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> to add noise to the local updates or a local differential privacy mechanism where each client perturbs its updates before sending it to an untrusted aggregator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>]</cite>.

The intuition is that the semi-honest server will be difficult to infer private information of a single instance from the differentially private local models because they do not contain details of the local datasets. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, applying vanilla DP in FL does not produce satisfactory results for mitigating SIAs, since it suffers from an unacceptable trade-off between model accuracy and defense effectiveness against SIAs. Recently, several DP mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>, <a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>, <a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite> have been designed particularly for FL training that can achieve better privacy-utility trade-offs than DP-SGD. For such advanced DP mechanisms in FL, it is worth investigating whether they can effectively mitigate our proposed SIAs while maintaining the high utility of the FL model.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new inference attack called SIAs in federated learning, which allows an honest-but-curious server to identify the source client of a training record. We adopt the Bayesian theorem to derive an inference method enabling the server to gain significant source information of the training data during each communication round. We propose <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedSGD-SIA</span>, <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedAvg-SIA</span>, and <span id="S7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedMD-SIA</span> showing that in existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or the predictions on a public dataset will lead to source information leakage to the server. We evaluate SIAs on many datasets under different federated settings. The comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of SIAs. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to investigate how the non-IID data distribution and local epochs impact the performance of SIAs. We identify that the overfitting of local models is the key factor contributing to the success of SIAs. We evaluate differential privacy as a defense mechanism to mitigate SIAs, but the experimental results suggest differential privacy is not a good solution because of the unacceptable trade-offs between model utilities and the defense effectiveness against SIAs. We discuss the limitations of our proposed SIAs and potential research opportunities. The investigation of finding appropriate regularization techniques as a
defense against SIAs to achieve satisfactory privacy-utility trade-offs becomes our future work.</p>
