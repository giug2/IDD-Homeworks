<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">The rapid advancement and increasing complexity of pretrained models, exemplified by CLIP, offer significant opportunities as well as challenges for Federated Learning (FL), a critical component of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence. This research delves into the intricacies of integrating large foundation models like CLIP within FL frameworks to enhance privacy, efficiency, and adaptability across heterogeneous data landscapes. It specifically addresses the challenges posed by non-IID data distributions, the computational and communication overheads of leveraging such complex models, and the skewed representation of classes within datasets. We propose TriplePlay, a framework that integrates CLIP as an adapter to enhance FL’s adaptability and performance across diverse data distributions. This approach addresses the long-tail distribution challenge to ensure fairness while reducing resource demands through quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques.Our simulation results demonstrate that TriplePlay effectively decreases GPU usage costs and speeds up the learning process, achieving convergence with reduced communication overhead.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a neural network-based model developed by OpenAI, trained on an extensive and diverse dataset of images paired with textual descriptions. This approach enables CLIP to effectively understand and associate visual content with natural language. The evolution of pretrained models, from perceptron to complex architectures like CLIP, has led to an increase in their size and knowledge capacity. As FL cements its role as a key enabler of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence, it confronts challenges that stem from the inherent heterogeneity of data distributions across clients and the considerable resource demands of incorporating large foundation models like CLIP. These challenges, notably non-IID data and the substantial computational and communication costs, impede the seamless deployment and efficacy of FL in diverse operational environments characterized by a wide range of edge device capabilities. Despite its reputation for state-of-the-art image and text representations, CLIP remains relatively unexplored in FL, with prior efforts attempted to achieve efficient aggregation and local training but falling short in addressing computational costs and data distribution heterogeneity. Besides, in the realm of FL, the significance of data quality and distribution cannot be overstated as many datasets suffer from a common issue known as the ‘long-tail distribution’, where certain classes or categories are underrepresented, making it challenging for models to learn effectively from these minority samples. Besides, large model can cost high network bandwidth and encounter communication overhead. Considering these challenges, this paper investigates the impact of integrating a foundation model like CLIP as an adapter in FL on the adaptability and performance of FL systems across varied data distributions, to transcend existing limitations and fully exploit the potential of this powerful model.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recognizing CLIP’s unexploited potential in FL—despite its proven capabilities in generating state-of-the-art image and text representations—this research aims to bridge the gap by investigating strategies to overcome these obstacles. The challenges of data quality and the prevalent issue of long-tail distribution, where certain data classes are significantly underrepresented, further complicate model training and learning processes, underscoring the need for innovative solutions to ensure balanced and effective learning across all data spectrums.
This paper sets out to explore CLIP’s robust feature extraction capabilities, while addressing the computational constraints inherent in FL deployments. Moreover, this paper explores quantization and low rank adaptation to reduce the resource
demands of large models in FL, focusing on decreasing the size and enhancing the efficiency of model exchanges between clients and the server. To this end, we provide scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving machine learning solutions that capitalize on the strengths of advanced pretrained models and synthetic data creation, ultimately fostering personalized and equitable AI applications.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a decentralized approach that allows multiple devices or institutions to collaboratively train a machine learning model without directly sharing their data. Instead of pooling data into a central location, FL sends the model to local data sources, where it is trained independently on each dataset. The locally trained models are then aggregated into a global model, allowing the overall system to learn from distributed data while preserving privacy and reducing the need for data transfer.
This approach has been continuously refined to address real-world machine learning challenges, particularly in scenarios where data is highly distributed and heterogeneous. A key challenge that FL addresses is the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) nature of client data, where the data on each client may differ significantly in distribution, leading to variability in model performance. As a result, FL has proven effective in environments with diverse data distributions, such as healthcare, finance, and mobile applications, where privacy and data ownership are paramount concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
However, the advent of data heterogeneity across clients introduced significant challenges, leading to skewed local models and impeded convergence rates.
Several efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> were made to transpose existing domain generalization methodologies to the FL landscape.
More recent developments have delved into the realms of generalization within FL, acknowledging its novelty and the inherent challenges it presents. Initial discussions on this topic aimed to delineate performance gaps, including out-of-sample and participation discrepancies, laying the groundwork for more focused solutions. Besides, efforts were made to transpose existing domain generalization methodologies to the FL landscape, with initiatives like FL Games <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and FedSAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> leading the charge. These solutions tailor strategies like Nash equilibrium and Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) to foster invariant feature learning across clients and enhance model robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Yet, despite these advancements, a critical observation is the limited applicability of these generalization strategies to larger models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and their underutilization of knowledge from pretrained models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This gap signifies challenges within the FL domain, hinting at the necessity for novel approaches that can fully leverage the breadth of knowledge encapsulated in large, pretrained models while ensuring robust generalization across diverse and distributed data landscapes.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The pretrained Models (e.g., Vision-Language models) are distinguished by their ability to concurrently learn from vast datasets containing both images and their corresponding textual descriptions. A notable feature of these models is their zero-shot prediction capabilities, where they can accurately infer information or classify images they have never encountered during training. One of the pioneering models in this area, CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> utilizes paired image and text encoders primarily for tasks like image classification and retrieval. Similarly, the ALIGN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> focuses on training visual and language representations using large collections of images paired with noisy alt-text data.
Further developments have seen models like BLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> which not only understand but also generate vision-language content, emphasizing the use of refined captions. FLAVA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> represents a leap towards learning from both paired and unpaired images and text, integrating both multimodal and unimodal encoders for a comprehensive representation. SimVLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> simplifies the model training process through the use of large-scale weak supervision alongside a novel prefix language modeling objective.
Extensions of the CLIP model to accommodate multilingual text encoding, such as AltCLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and domain-specific adaptations like FashionCLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and PLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, showcase the versatility and adaptability of these models to various datasets and objectives.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generating synthetic data using GANs offers a promising solution for handling the long-tail distribution in foundation models. In datasets where certain classes are significantly underrepresented, GANs can be trained to generate synthetic samples that mimic the distribution of these minority classes (see Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-B Pretrained Vision-Language Models ‣ II Background Study ‣ TriplePlay: Enhancing Federated Learning with CLIP for Non-IID Data and Resource Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b)). By augmenting the dataset with these synthetic samples, the model is exposed to a more balanced representation of all classes, allowing it to learn more effectively from the underrepresented classes. This approach enhances the model’s ability to generalize and make equitable predictions across all classes, leading to improved performance on minority classes and a more robust foundation model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We seek to address the dual challenges: communication overhead and resource consumption during large model exchange in FL training through the strategic application of quantization and QLoRa. Quantization decreases model size by converting parameters into lower-bit representations, thereby enhancing memory usage and computational speed. Besides, QLoRa improves the training process of quantized models on agents’ devices, ensuring minimal accuracy loss and efficient learning from local data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-B Pretrained Vision-Language Models ‣ II Background Study ‣ TriplePlay: Enhancing Federated Learning with CLIP for Non-IID Data and Resource Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we present our proposed FL architecture, which unfolds through a series of interconnected processes. Initially, for each agent, a pretrained CLIP model extracts task-specific features from textual and image data, identified as T and I. Subsequently, within each client’s domain, an adapter tailored to these features undergoes training with the local dataset. This adapter is fine-tuned using QLoRa, incorporating both quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques to achieve efficient model compression and minimize resource consumption. The refined local model is then uploaded to the server. At the server level, an aggregation process takes place where the parameters from all local models are combined through weighted averaging to form the global model. This global model is redistributed to each agent for the purpose of updating the parameters of their individual adapters. This cycle of local training, uploading, aggregation, and redistribution continues iteratively, aiming for convergence or until a predetermined number of rounds is completed.</p>

proficiency in semantic understanding and precise text generation tailored to the specific visual context of each client. Each FL client’s local visual data, ranging from the activity of a hospital patient to a zebra herd, is processed to produce accurate and contextually appropriate textual descriptions. This highlights the model’s ability to understand and articulate fine-grained details from diverse visual inputs, ensuring personalized and relevant textual outputs based on the local datasets.

The FedCLIP line exhibits significant fluctuations, with utilization percentages oscillating between approximately 60% and 70%, indicating a variable demand on the GPU resources throughout the communication rounds. In stark contrast, our proposed approach, TriplePlay maintains a remarkably steady and lower GPU utilization, consistently around the 35% mark, indicating a more efficient and stable usage of GPU resources over time. This visual data clearly suggests that the TriplePlay method ensures a more uniform and possibly more efficient GPU usage profile compared to FedCLIP.

We observe that in terms of loss minimization, each client exhibits a consistent decrease in loss as the number of communication rounds increases. This indicates that the TriplePlay effectively minimizes the loss function for each client participating in the FL process. Similarly, the accuracy graph demonstrates a steady improvement in performance across all clients. The increasing accuracy values suggest that TriplePlay successfully learns and generalizes from the distributed data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the scalability of our proposed approach, we experiment with a higher number of clients and demonstrate our results in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-B Result Analysis ‣ IV Experimental Analysis ‣ TriplePlay: Enhancing Federated Learning with CLIP for Non-IID Data and Resource Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. We perform evaluations using two different client configurations: 5 clients and 10 clients. In the 5-client configuration, we observe a steady decrease in server loss and a corresponding increase in accuracy over the 500 communication rounds. When we scale up to 10 clients, we notice a similar trend, with consistent loss minimization and accuracy improvement. Moreover, the accuracy graph for the 10-client setup shows a comparable performance to the 5-client configuration, with a slight increase in the final accuracy. These findings underscore the scalability of TriplePlay, as it maintains its effectiveness in terms of loss minimization and accuracy enhancement even when the number of clients is doubled.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has set forth a framework to address the pressing challenges in FL, especially in the context of integrating large foundation models like CLIP and managing data diversity and resource constraints. The outcomes include improved adaptability of FL systems across varied data distributions, enhanced model performance, especially for minority classes, and a reduction in the computational and communication resources required. Ultimately, this research aims to push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in FL, paving the way for more inclusive, efficient, and privacy-preserving machine learning models that can adapt to and thrive within the complex, data-diverse landscapes of the real world.</p>
