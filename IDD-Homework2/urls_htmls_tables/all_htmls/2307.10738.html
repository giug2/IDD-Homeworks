<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has enabled multiple data owners (a.k.a. FL clients) to train machine learning models collaboratively without revealing private data. Since the FL server can only engage a limited number of clients in each training round, FL client selection has become an important research problem. Existing approaches generally focus on either enhancing FL model performance or enhancing the fair treatment of FL clients. The problem of balancing performance and fairness considerations when selecting FL clients remains open. To address this problem, we propose the <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Fair</span>ness-aware <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Fed</span>erated <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">C</span>lient <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>election (FairFedCS) approach. Based on Lyapunov optimization, it dynamically adjusts FL clients’ selection probabilities by jointly considering their reputations, times of participation in FL tasks and contributions to the resulting model performance. By not using threshold-based reputation filtering, it provides FL clients with opportunities to redeem their reputations after a perceived poor performance, thereby further enhancing fair client treatment. Extensive experiments based on real-world multimedia datasets show that FairFedCS achieves 19.6% higher fairness and 0.73% higher test accuracy on average than the best-performing state-of-the-art approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The success of multimedia applications (e.g., computer vision-based systems) depends on the availability of sufficient data to train effective machine learning (ML) models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, direct access to distributively generated datasets (e.g., usage data from mobile devices) risks infringing on user privacy, leading to the introduction of laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> protection prohibiting such data sharing. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has been proposed as an alternative collaborative ML paradigm without requiring direct access to sensitive local data in order to adapt to the privacy-aware environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With FL come new challenges to be resolved.
One important challenge is data and resource heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. During federated model training, data owners (a.k.a. FL clients) contribute not only their local data, but also their computation and communication resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. As data quality, quantity and local resources vary among clients, their contributions (e.g., impact on model performance, convergence rate) to FL differ. Hence, how to select FL clients to achieve the desired design goals has become an important research problem in the field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One category of FL client selection approaches focuses on fulfilling the goals of the FL servers. They generally adopt threshold-based approaches to filter out FL clients deemed to be undesirable (e.g., with perceived low-quality data or low reputation) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, such an approach disregards the FL clients’ interest (e.g., opportunities to participate in FL) and may cause some of them to perceive that they are not fairly treated by the FL system. Without the ability to fairly treat FL clients, an FL system risks client attrition which negatively affects the long-term sustainable operation of such systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Fairness-aware FL client selection approaches started to emerge in recent years. Some focus on ensuring that data owners have guaranteed rates to be selected to join FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Others attempt to give more preference to high-performing FL clients while offering equitable opportunities for others to be selected to join FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the problem of balancing performance and fairness considerations when selecting FL clients remains open.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">

By not using threshold-based reputation filtering, it provides FL clients with opportunities to redeem their reputations even after perceiving poor performance, thereby further enhancing fair client treatment. In addition, it offers an easy-to-use control variable to enable FL system administrators to adjust the trade-off between improving the FL models’ performance vs. improving fair treatment of the FL clients.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL client selection approaches can be divided into two main categories: 1) performance-oriented approaches, and 2) fairness-oriented approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Performance-oriented approaches focus on selecting clients that best fulfill the FL servers’ goals.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, threshold-based approaches are used to select high-quality FL clients and filter out low-quality ones. The quality metrics used include the amount of local data, contributions to FL model performance and reputation, etc.
However, this brings another problem - oversampling of FL clients from specific groups causing the global FL model to bias towards the data owned by these clients, thereby deteriorating its ability to generalize <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, these approaches do not serve the interests of the FL clients. For an FL system, attracting enough clients to continue participating in FL model training is key to maintaining its long-term sustainable operation. Under the performance-oriented approaches, clients perceived to be of relatively low quality might not be given the opportunity to join FL (a.k.a. unfair selection among clients). As a result, these clients cannot receive any incentives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and might choose to leave the system, resulting in attrition of the pool of candidate FL clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness-oriented approaches focus on ensuring that FL clients have equal opportunities to be selected for FL model training.
Huang <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduced a long-term fairness constraint by setting a guaranteed rate for each FL client to be selected.
However, the notion of fairness in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is not properly constructed. Fairness in their context refers to how likely the FL server randomly selects clients in each round.
In FL, clients do not contribute equally to the FL model due to data and resource heterogeneity. Such a strictly equal selection scheme can be perceived as unfair by clients who contribute more significantly to the FL model than others.
Such a problem, referred to as the free-rider issue in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, can discourage high-quality clients from participating in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which is highly harmful.
Song <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a reputation-based FL client selection scheme with fairness constraints.
The notion of fairness adopted is selection fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which prefers clients with higher reputation values while also providing opportunities for other clients to join FL.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> does not provide opportunities for clients to redeem their reputations as it adopts a threshold-based approach.
In reputation-based best-effort systems, it is natural for the perceived reputation of the participants to fluctuate.
If a client’s reputation falls below the threshold at any point in time, it will be excluded from all future FL tasks.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under FairFedCS, part of the FL server’s goal is to give preference to high-quality FL clients (in terms of data quality). However, since the local datasets are not accessible directly by the FL server, it cannot know each client’s data distribution and quality.
Hence, we design a reputation model to estimate the potential contribution by a given client, which is used as a reference to select high-quality clients while ensuring fair treatment of FL clients (as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 The Proposed Approach ‣ Fairness-Aware Client Selection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

Hence, it produces fair client contribution evaluations. However, since the computational complexity of calculating SV increases exponentially, we leverage the GTG-Shapley approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which provides accurate estimation of the SVs in a highly efficient manner.
During FL model aggregation, the FL server characterizes each client’s behavior based on its SV.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed FairFedCS approach leverages Lyapunov optimization to jointly consider the fair treatment of FL clients and FL model performance to trade-off between the two goals.
Lyapunov optimization relies on a properly designed Lyapunov function to control a given dynamic system optimally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
The key here is to convert the dual objectives into a single objective function to be optimized without manually setting decision thresholds.

<p id="S3.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to other reputation-based FL client selection strategies, FairFedCS is more advantageous as it does not rely on a reputation threshold to qualify clients’ eligibility to be selected for FL training.
In this way, it does not completely exclude FL clients with perceived low reputations, giving them chances to contribute to FL and redeem their reputation, thereby further enhancing fairness. In addition, FL clients with hard samples might be mistakenly given a low reputation during the initial stages of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. FairFedCS does not preclude an FL system from leveraging their contributions at later stages of training (in which hard samples can further boost model performance).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of fairness, it can be observed that
FairFedCS significantly outperforms all the baselines.
It achieved 19.6% higher JRI on average than the best-performing baseline, RBCS-F.
This implies that FairFedCS has brought significant improvement in selection fairness. Greedy performs the worst as it focuses on selecting only a few high-quality clients without giving opportunities to the rest.
FairFedCS has also achieved higher fairness than its ablated version, demonstrating that our key design of incorporating reputation into the virtual queues enhances selection fairness.

<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, improving selection fairness is likely to result in drops in test accuracy as it increases the probability of low-quality clients being selected, which negatively impacts FL model performance. However, the experiment results show that FairFedCS maintains a satisfactory test accuracy while achieving significant gains in fairness. Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.2 Balancing Fairness and Performance Goals ‣ 3 The Proposed Approach ‣ Fairness-Aware Client Selection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows that FairFedCS consistently achieves top-2 ranks in test accuracy under all conditions. On average, it achieves 0.73% higher test accuracy than the best-performing baseline, RBFF.</p>

It outperforms the best-performing baseline approach by 2.71% over fashion-MNIST. This demonstrates the key advantages of FairFedCS: 1) It is capable of identifying minority clients with relatively low-quality data; and 2) it selects minority clients with reasonable frequencies such that the final FL model is sufficiently exposed to the minority class while not significantly affected by noisy data.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed FairFedCS, a dynamic FL client selection approach to balance model performance with selection fairness.
Under FairFedCS, no client is excluded from being selected, and their selection probabilities depend on their potential contributions.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairFedCS significantly enhances selection fairness while maintaining a high level of test accuracy.
It achieves 19.6% higher fairness and 0.73% higher test accuracy on average than the best-performing baseline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In subsequent research, we will further adapt FairFedCS to dynamic FL marketplaces with multiple FL servers competing for FL clients to investigate how to ensure selection fairness under non-monopoly settings.</p>
