<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the proliferation of edge smart devices and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies, intelligent fatigue detection has become one of the most-used methods in our daily driving. To improve the performance of the detection model, a series of techniques have been developed. However, existing work still leaves much to be desired, such as privacy disclosure and communication cost. To address these issues, we propose FedSup, a client-edge-cloud framework for privacy and efficient fatigue detection. Inspired by the federated learning technique, FedSup intelligently utilizes the collaboration between client, edge, and cloud server to realizing dynamic model optimization while protecting edge data privacy. Moreover, to reduce the unnecessary system communication overhead, we further propose a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) approximation strategy on the clients and an uncertainty weighted aggregation algorithm on the cloud to enhance the central model training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the FedSup framework is suitable for IoV scenarios and outperforms other mainstream methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many fatigue supervision methods have emerged with the popularization of intelligent equipment and the IoV. The methods judge whether the driver is fatigued by analyzing changes of the collected drivers’ facial expressions such as blinking, eye closure duration, etc. The existing work can be divided into two categories as shown in Fig. 1: i) <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the cloud-based method</span>: the server located in the cloud makes judgments by simply analyzing the uploaded driving information and informs results to clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">2</span></a>]</cite>; ii) <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the client-based method</span>: the client directly judges fatigue actions based on the implanted supervision model, which is trained in the server using the uploaded driving data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from the following issues: i) the cloud-based method lacks intelligence and is vulnerable to network delays owing to the transmission of driving information and judgment results; ii) the client-based method cannot ensure the accuracy of judgments because of lacking dynamic optimization of the trained supervision model; iii) the two methods pose serious security risks to clients’ privacy since data collected by cloud for centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The Federated Learning (FL) proposed by Google can solve the above-mentioned problems by training models on clients, optimizing the central model through constantly aggregating the updated local training models, at last sending the updated model to clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>]</cite>. Its effectiveness has been verified in some related studies such as hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">5</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">6</span></a>]</cite>. However, the proposed FL is based on the two-level framework composed of cloud and client levels, considering vehicles as training nodes that lack data labeling capabilities and require low latency, which is not feasible for the practical IoV scenario where computing and communication resources are limited. To solve the resource limitation problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>]</cite> proposed migrating machine learning to the edge computing scenario, which places additional computing devices at the edge to address latency and privacy problem. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic allocation algorithm of edge resources (DAERs), which improve the prediction accuracy of the staged destination of the vehicle to help allocate resources reasonably. However, none of these work considered the following problems: i) The client may not have sufficient computing resources; ii) The transmission of training data may produce large amounts of communication overhead.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Federated learning-based fatigue driving behaviors Supervision framework (FedSup), in which the edge node trains the local model using uncertainty data of images uploaded by clients and only uploads model parameters to the cloud server for aggregation, and the server sends the aggregated training model to clients to judge fatigue actions. On the one hand, it reduces the computation pressures of clients and communication overhead. On the other hand, edge nodes upload parameters instead of raw data to the cloud server for model optimization ensuring clients’ data privacy, and the server distributes parameters to all edge nodes and clients realizing a dynamic update of the model.</p>

Bayesian probability theory offers us mathematically grounded methods to quantify model uncertainty while usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. Thus, we perform dropout training in the CNN as an approximate Bayesian inference.</p>

Our uncertainty data upload method achieves uploading 1 or even 2 orders of magnitude fewer data in learning iteration.</p>

In each plot, we show the best accuracy for centralized and standalone SGD. Both of them are independent of the a-axis since there is no parameter sharing. Comparing the accuracy of FedSup with the baselines reflects the tradeoff between utility and privacy.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The following conclusion can be made based on the results show in Fig. 8. FedSup outperforms FedAVG in both data sets. The more unbalanced distribution of each client, the higher the accuracy of FedSup will reach, which demonstrates that FedSup is more suitable for IoV scenarios with unbalanced data distribution. In the ZJU data set, FedAVG has higher accuracy in the initial training period, which indicates that FedAVG performs better when the data is evenly distributed. Compared with the FedAVG model, FedSup has less fluctuation and achieves the optimal accuracy of nearly 160 rounds, while FedAVG requires more than 200 rounds, compared with a 30% reduction in communication cost. In the Eyeblink8 data set, FedSup achieves the optimal accuracy at nearly 140 rounds, which is better than FedAVG with 190 rounds and reduces the communication cost by about 35%.</p>
