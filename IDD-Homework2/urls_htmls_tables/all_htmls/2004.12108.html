<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">Edge computing and distributed machine learning have advanced to a level that can revolutionize a particular organization. Distributed devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) often produce a large amount of data, eventually resulting in big data that can be vital in uncovering hidden patterns, and other insights in numerous fields such as healthcare, banking, and policing. Data related to areas such as healthcare and banking can contain potentially sensitive data that can become public if they are not appropriately sanitized. Federated learning (FedML) is a recently developed distributed machine learning (DML) approach that tries to preserve privacy by bringing the learning of an ML model to data owners’. However, literature shows different attack methods such as membership inference that exploit the vulnerabilities of ML models as well as the coordinating servers to retrieve private data. Hence, FedML needs additional measures to guarantee data privacy. Furthermore, big data often requires more resources than available in a standard computer. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a distributed perturbation algorithm named as DISTPAB, for privacy preservation of horizontally partitioned data. DISTPAB alleviates computational bottlenecks by distributing the task of privacy preservation utilizing the asymmetry of resources of a distributed environment, which can have resource-constrained devices as well as high-performance computers. Experiments show that DISTPAB provides high accuracy, high efficiency, high scalability, and high attack resistance. Further experiments on privacy-preserving FedML show that DISTPAB is an excellent solution to stop privacy leaks in DML while preserving high data utility.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The amalgamation of different technologies such as edge computing, IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning has contributed to a rapid proliferation of technological development in many areas such as healthcare and banking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The increase of cheap pervasive sensing devices has contributed to the rapid growth of IoT, becoming one of the main sources of big data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In the broader spectrum of sensor systems, cyber-physical systems and advanced analysis tools are converged together to provide consolidated services. As a result, a particular system (e.g. healthcare, banking) can now be benefited from multiple sources of data, additionally to what is accumulated by conventional means <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This growing availability of different sources of data has been able to revolutionize leading fields such as healthcare technologies to achieve excellent achievements in many areas such as drug discovery, early outbreak detection, epidemic control analysis, which were once considered to be complicated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, data related to the fields such as healthcare, banking and policing are massively convoluted with sensitive private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. It is essential to go for extreme measures to protect sensitive data while analyzing them to generate meaningful insights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, it is an extremely challenging task as systems related to fields such as healthcare and banking are often densely distributed. This paper examines the issues related to distributed data sharing and analysis in order to devise an optimal privacy preservation solution towards distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in environments such as presented in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which represents a typical distributed industry setup (e.g. smart healthcare, open banking) that runs on IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy violations in fields such as healthcare and banking can be catastrophic due to the availability of highly sensitive person-specific data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Among different definitions, privacy for data sharing and analysis can be defined as “Controlled Information Release” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. It has been shown before that it is easy to identify patients in a database by combining several quasi-identifiers such as age, postcode, and sex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Removing just the identifiers from the dataset before releasing is not enough to protect the individuals’ privacy, and leaking personal information to untrusted third parties can be catastrophic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) is the area that applies privacy-preserving approaches to data mining methods to protect the private information of the users of the underlying input data during the data mining processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we investigate the PPDM solutions that can be applied to limit privacy leaks in distributed machine learning (DML) under big data settings. The area of homomorphic encryption is widely explored for PPDM. However, in terms of big data and DML, homomorphic encryption cannot address the three challenges, (i) efficiency, (ii) high volume, and (iii) massive distribution of data. Furthermore, homomorphic encryption increases the data size during the encryption ( e.g. single bit can be multiplied to 16 bits), which is unreliable for big data and increases the data storage burdens  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Compared to encryption, data perturbation (data modification) can provide efficient solutions towards privacy preservation with a predetermined error that can result due to the data modification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FedML) is a distributed machine approach that is developed to provide efficient privacy-preserving machine learning in a distributed environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In FedML, the machine learning model generation is done at the data owners’ computers, and a coordinating server (e.g. a cloud server) is used to generate a global model and share the ML knowledge among the distributed entities (e.g. edge devices). Since the original data never leave the data owners’ devices, FedML is assumed to provide privacy to the raw data. However, ML models show vulnerability to privacy inference attacks such as model memorizing attacks and membership inference, which focus on retrieving sensitive data from trained ML models even under black-box settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Model inversion attacks that recover images from a facial recognition system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is another example that shows the vulnerability of ML to advanced adversarial attacks. If adversaries gain access to the central server/coordinating server, they can deploy attacks such as model memorizing attacks, which can memorize and extract raw data from the trained models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Hence, DML approaches, such as FedML, need additional measures to guarantee that there will not be any unanticipated privacy leaks. Differential privacy is a privacy definition (privacy model) that offers a strong notion of privacy compared to previous models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Due to the application of heavy noise, the previous attempt to enforce differential privacy on big data has resulted in low utility in terms of advanced analytics, which can be catastrophic for applications such as healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. A major disadvantage of other techniques such as random rotation and geometric perturbation is their incapability to process high dimensional data (big data) efficiently. These perturbation approaches spend an excessive amount of time to generate better results with good utility and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In terms of efficiency, additive perturbation provides good performance. However, the perturbed data end up with a low privacy guarantee  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Another issue that is often ignored when developing privacy-preserving mechanisms for big data is data capacity issues. The application of privacy preservation (the specific algorithms based on encryption on perturbation) on a large database can be extensive and impossible if the exact resource allocation scenarios are not implemented correctly. A recently developed algorithm named PABIDOT for big data privacy preservation promises to provide high efficiency towards big data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The proposed method shows high classification accuracy for big data while providing high privacy. However, PABIDOT cannot be used for DML as it does not address the data distribution and data perturbation using resource-constrained devices (as depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a new DISTributed Privacy-preserving Approach for distriButed machine learning in geographically distributed data and systems (DISTPAB). DISTPAB is a distributed privacy-preserving algorithm that employs a data perturbation mechanism. The distributed scenario of data perturbation of DISTPAB allows the perturbation of extensive datasets that need to be shared among distributed entities without leaking privacy. The actual data perturbation is conducted in the distributed entities (in edge/fog devices) locally using the global perturbation parameters generated in a central coordinating node before conducting FedML. This way, DISTPAB restricts original data to be communicated (before perturbation) via the network, which can be attacked by adversaries. The global perturbation parameter generation of DISTPAB ensures that there is no degradation of accuracy or attack resistance of the perturbed data. DISTPAB was first tested using six datasets obtained from the data repository named ”UCI Machine Learning Repository”<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php</span></span></span>.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed systems such as available in healthcare have become vastly complex due to the amalgamation of different technologies such as IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing. Due to these advanced capabilities, a modern system can utilize a myriad of data sources to facilitate improved capabilities towards essential services. The nature of distributed data platforms introduces a plethora of complexities towards preserving user privacy of users without compromising data utility. Extremely high dimensions and massive distribution of data sources are two of the main complexities that need to be addressed when designing robust privacy-preserving approaches for DML systems. Due to these reasons, privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) approaches should be efficient and should be able to work in distributed settings. Approaches based on secure multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, attribute access control  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, lightweight cryptographic procedures  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> are few examples for some encryption approach which can provide good privacy. However, the high computational complexity of such encryption scenarios can seriously jeopardize the performance of a distributed ML setup. The inherent high computational complexity of the cryptographic approaches requires excessive amounts of computational resources, which include large storage facilities such as cloud computing that are often controlled by third-parties. Furthermore, the encryption approaches such as homomorphic encryption for PPDM increase the size of the data after the application of encryption, which is not suitable for the domain of big data as the data sizes can already be extensive. Hence, the implementation of cryptographic scenarios for distributed databases can be unrealistic and unaffordable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Compared to encryption, data perturbation/modification provides efficient and lightweight solutions for big data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and hence, data perturbation is a better fitting solution for PPDM of distributed data.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.5" class="ltx_p">Previous data perturbation approaches include swapping  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, additive perturbation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, condensation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, randomized response <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, microaggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, random rotation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, random projection  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, geometric perturbation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and hybrid perturbation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Due to the modifications, the data end up with reduced utility.

ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> are some examples for privacy models. However, these models exhibit vulnerabilities to attacks such as composition attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, minimality attacks  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, and foreground knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> attacks. Moreover, the perturbation approaches that use these models do not scale for big data with high dimensions. When the dimensions of the input dataset grow, the computational cost necessary to conduct data perturbation grows exponentially. The literature refers to this phenomenon as ”The Dimensionality Curse”  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Another issue in high dimensional data is the leak of extra information that can be effectively used by attackers to misuse sensitive private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Differential privacy (DP) is another privacy model, which was developed more recently to render a strong privacy guarantee compared to prior approaches. Nevertheless, due to the high noise levels imposed by DP algorithms, DP might not be the optimal choice for big data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The distribution of data sources and infrastructures also introduces a massive complexity towards the development of robust privacy-preserving approaches for distributed databases. Modern distributed privacy-preserving approaches include federated (FedNN) machine learning and split learning (SplitNN), which can provide a certain level of privacy to distributed databases. In FedML, the distributed clients use their local data to train local ML models and communicate the locally trained ML model parameters with the central server to train a global representation of the local models. The server then distributes the global model parameters with the clients so that the clients can now generalize their local models based on the model parameters federated by the server. SplitML has a similar distributed setup. However, instead of communicating the model parameters, SplitML splits the ML model between the clients and the server. During the training process, a client will hold a portion of the ML model, whereas the server will hold the other portion of the ML model. As a result, a client will transfer activations from its split layer to the split layer of the server during both forward and backward passes of the training process of the ML model. When many clients need to connect to the server for ML model training, the clients will either have a peer to peer communication or a client-server communication for the model parameter communications in order for each client to have a synchronous ML model training process. However, both FedML and SplitML have the same problem of the central point of failure as the server in both cases has too much control over the model learning process. If the server is attacked, the whole framework becomes vulnerable, and as a result, user privacy cannot be guaranteed. Especially the attack methods such as membership inference and model memorization can exploit the vulnerabilities of the central point of failure to retrieve raw data used for the model training process. The other distributed approaches which work on horizontally and vertically partitioned data also tend to produce issues towards efficiency or privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. As most of these methods use the approaches based on homomorphic encryption to provide privacy, such methods become inefficient when working with big data, and the need to share too much information with the server makes most of them untrusted and yields the same issue of the central point of failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Among data perturbation approaches, matrix multiplicative approaches proved to provide high utility towards data clustering and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Examples for matrix multiplicative perturbation approaches include random rotation, geometric, and projection perturbation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> methods. For example, random rotation perturbation repeatedly multiplies the input data by a randomly generated matrix with the properties of an orthogonal matrix, until the perturbed data satisfy a pre-anticipated level of privacy  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. An additional matrix of translation and distance perturbation are combined with random rotation to produce geometric data perturbation. The added randomness of the random translation matrix improves the privacy of the perturbed data. However, geometric data perturbation also follows the same repeated approach until the perturbed data satisfy an expected level of privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Random projection perturbation follows a different approach by projecting the high dimensional input data to a low dimensional space  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. One of the important properties of matrix multiplicative data perturbation approaches is their ability to preserve the distance between tuples of the input dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. As a result of this property, matrix multiplicative approaches provide high utility for data classification and clustering, which are based on distance calculations. However, due to the inefficient approaches utilized for the optimal perturbation parameter generation, rotation perturbation, geometric perturbation, and projection fail to provide enough scalability. PABIDOT is a recently developed perturbation approach for the privacy preservation of big data classification, using the properties of geometric data perturbations. PABIDOT provides high efficiency towards big data while maintaining high privacy and classification accuracy. However, for distributed healthcare scenarios such as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, PABIDOT cannot be applied as it is not a distributed algorithm. As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a distributed system can be composed of branches that are geographically dispersed. The data coming from each branch should be perturbed before they leave the local network. A distributed data perturbation algorithm which can provide high utility while maintaining high privacy for distributed healthcare is essential.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section explains the steps of developing a distributed data perturbation algorithm (named as DISTPAB) for a distributed data and machine learning. Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4 Our Approach: DISTPAB ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the application of privacy to a distributed healthcare ecosystem shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. As shown in the figure, the main goal of DISTPAB is to shift the perturbation to the distributed branches before the data leave the local edge and fog layer. However, in doing so, the algorithm should not lose global utility. To achieve that, the main branch (the research center) and the distributed branches will conduct a perturbation parameter exchange. As the perturbation is done using the globally optimal parameters, DISTPAB can maintain a proper balance between utility and privacy. During our explanations, we will be using the words node and entity alternatively, representing the same concept. However, more specifically, we consider an entity to be a fully populated institute, whereas a node to be one or more computing/processing devices within an entity.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>An example scenario where DISTPAB is integrated to a distributed healthcare system to preserve the privacy of data. The lowest layer represents the distributed set of entities (hospitals) and their interaction with DISTPAB within the fog and edge bounds. As the figure shows, the distributed components of DISTPAB are integrated into each of the distributed hospitals for performing the data perturbations. The central controlling entity (research centre) will be communicating with the cloud layer, which supports third-party analytical services. In this setup, we assume that no party saves original IoT data, and will only save the perturbed data.</figcaption>

<p id="S4.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">After determining the best perturbation parameters, the geometric transformations are conducted on the normalized input dataset following the order of reflection, noise translation, and rotation. We follow this order of transformations to avoid the points (in the n-dimensional space) closer to the origin, getting lower levels of perturbation. Rotation has a larger effect on the points that are far away from the origin compared to those which are close to the origin. As a result, the points which are close to the origin can get easily attacked. Equation <a href="#S4.E11" title="Equation 11 ‣ 4.1 Centralized perturbation paradigm ‣ 4 Our Approach: DISTPAB ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows the order of the application of the three transformations on the normalized input data matrix, where rotation is conducted as the last transformation for the highest perturbation possible. As the next step, we add noise using randomized expansion. Reverse z-score normalization on the perturbed data is used to generate an output in the attribute ranges similar to the original dataset. Next, the tuples are randomly swapped in order to limit vulnerability to data linkage attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Algorithm <a href="#algorithm2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.3 Workload of a distributed entity ‣ 4 Our Approach: DISTPAB ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the workload of a distributed node (hospital) where the actual data perturbation is conducted. As the algorithm shows, the data will not be transmitted to the central entity as part of the perturbation process. First, the local parameters which are determined based on the local dataset will be sent to the central node. Next, the global parameters which are calculated and sent to the distributed entities will be used for the perturbation of the local dataset. However, the step of randomized expansion (refer step <a href="#algorithm2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.3 Workload of a distributed entity ‣ 4 Our Approach: DISTPAB ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> of Algorithm <a href="#algorithm2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.3 Workload of a distributed entity ‣ 4 Our Approach: DISTPAB ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) doesn’t involve any interactions with the central node as randomized expansion needs to evaluate the noise based on each individual instance. Consequently, in the distributed setting, randomized expansion increases the randomization of the perturbed data over the centralized approach.</p>

As shown in the algorithm, the central entity calculates the global perturbation parameters that need to be transmitted to the distributed entities. We assume that the distributed nodes are selected through a prior handshake mechanism that confirms the validity and reliability of the distributed nodes. However, since the proposed algorithm does not share the original data with any party before the perturbation, there will not be any privacy leak during the communication of the parameters.</p>

Each of the distributed entities will use the local data (perturbed) to train a local ML model (e.g. deep neural network) for a certain number of local epochs. After finishing the local epochs, the distributed entities will send the model parameters to the central repository to generate a global representation of the model by aggregating the model parameters (refer to section <a href="#S3.SS9" title="3.9 Federated Learning ‣ 3 Fundamentals ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.9</span></a>). The server (central authority) then passes the aggregated parameters back to the distributed entities to update the local models to generalize the models. This is called one round of federation. The federated learning setup will conduct a sufficient number of local epochs and federation rounds to train the ML models based on the requirements of the organization (e.g. production of data streams or big data), ML model architecture, and the properties of the input dataset.</p>

During the time calculations, we considered only the time consumed for the perturbations by the corresponding processing unit (central or distributed) to get an absolute understanding of time consumption. We ignored all the other factors, such as communication delays and I/O operation delays. For this experiment, we considered four distributed nodes communicating with the central node (refer Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Distributed computing setup ‣ 5 Results ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>). We used the LRDS dataset for the analysis. During the study on how the time consumption is affected by the number of attributes, we distributed the LRDS dataset equally among the distributed nodes (each processing 5000 tuples). Next, we evaluated the effect of the number of distributed nodes on the classification accuracy and attack resistance by gradually increasing the number of distributed nodes from 1 to 20. For this experiment also, we used the LRDS dataset, and for each case, the dataset was distributed equally among the distributed nodes.</p>

Consequently, the distributed version produces data with slightly higher randomization than its centralized version. This feature also reduces the utility of the data produced by the distributed version compared to the centralized version.

The classification accuracy was generated using 10-fold cross-validation. For the experiments on classification accuracy of a particular perturbed dataset, both classification model training and model testing were done using the same perturbed dataset. This is to check the model performance under strict privacy conditions where both the trained model and testing data do not leak any privacy to a third party. As shown in the figure, DISTPAB and PABIDOT produce similar classification accuracies. The figure also shows that both DISTPAB and PABIDOT outperform RP and GP.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We simulated the federated learning setup using the Python socket programming interface and the _thread interface. In the default configuration, we considered 4 distributed clients. For this experiment, we used the SSDS dataset that has a sufficient number of tuples to see a noticeable impact on the performance while making a low burden on the computer resources (mentioned at the beginning of section <a href="#S5" title="5 Results ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). We used a train/test split of 75%/25% during the experiments. We chose a simpler ANN model architecture for local models to avoid overfitting and achieve high efficiency with better training and testing accuracy. We estimated the number of hidden neurons to have a good model but at the same time to avoid overfitting by having too many neurons; the values were chosen after considering the data at hand. Each client trained a fully connected neural network; activation=‘relu’, batch size=64, hidden layer sizes=(10, 200, 200), final layer size = num of classes, final layer activation = ’softmax’, shuffle=True, optimizer=‘SGD’, learning rate=‘constant’, learning rate init=0.0001, momentum=0.5, verbose=True. The models were trained for 20 federation rounds, while each model was locally trained for 3 epochs. However, it is essential to note that, for a different dataset, a different ANN architecture might need to be selected, as the performance of a particular ANN architecture is dependent upon the properties of the input dataset.</p>

The figure shows the performance against different number of distributed branches (clients). During the experiment, the input dataset was equally divided between distributed entities. Consequently, the higher the number of clients, the lower the number of tuples in each client. Thus, the model needs more federation rounds for convergence when the number of clients is higher. We can also notice that there is a sudden drop in accuracy in the second round, and the accuracy increases as the federation continues. This is due to the extensive parameter modification that takes place during the second round. The higher the number of clients, the more significant the effect that results in a more substantial drop in the accuracy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed setting, DISTPAB works as a stand-alone data perturbation mechanism (a local data perturbation approach), which needs to be applied to the raw input data before subjected to federated learning. Hence, a model that would not converge on non-perturbed (raw/original) data could not be considered for convergence under perturbed data. From an empirical standpoint, according to Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.4 Classification Accuracy ‣ 5 Results ‣ Privacy Preserving Distributed Machine Learning with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we can notice that the classification accuracy generated by the perturbed data is very close to that of the original data. This implies that the perturbation employed by DISTPAB does not adversely affect the data representation. Consequently, we can assume that a model that can converge on the original raw data can converge on the perturbed data, subject to suitable hyperparameter tuning. However, more theoretical analysis is necessary to identify the exact effect of the perturbation on model convergence. The theoretical proof of convergence is beyond the scope of this paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>.

However, the number of attributes would not increase as frequently as the number of instances, and this increase is much smaller compared to the instances. When it comes to the distributed entities, the number of parameter communications will increase with the number of distributed entities. Compared to the number of instances, and the number of attributes, the increase in the number of distributed entities is extremely small. Hence, the increase in the number of distributed entities will not have a drastic impact on the scalability of DISTPAB. Hence, we can consider DISTPAB to provide high scalability towards distributed data perturbation and machine learning.</p>

Geometric data transformations and randomized expansion noise addition followed by random shuffling allow DISTPAB to impose high privacy by reducing the probability of data reconstruction attacks. Reverse z-score normalization of the final dataset takes the data back to their original attribute value ranges, making the attackers unable to distinguish the original data from the perturbed data. This feature reduces the chance of success of an attack trying to reconstruct the original input data from a perturbed dataset. DISTPAB provides better attack resistance compared to RP and GP. We can observe that the DISTPAB provides slightly better attack resistance compared to PABIDOT because DISTPAB adds an increased level of randomization as the randomized expansion step is carried out by each distributed entity separately to improve the randomness of data. However, in a federated learning setup, we do not share the perturbed data among the distributed clients or the server. Consequently, there will not be any data reconstruction attacks on the perturbed data, and due to the strong notion of privacy of the perturbed data, the privacy of the trained models will also be high.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Many modern systems, such as healthcare and open banking, are often geographically distributed and constrained with proper mechanisms for privacy-preserving data sharing for analytics. This paper proposed a distributed perturbation algorithm named DISTPAB that can enforce privacy for distributed machine learning. In the proposed setup of DISTPAB, a central/coordinating entity controls the global perturbation parameter generation, whereas the distributed entities can conduct local data perturbation.

Consequently, the operations on distributed entities have a low computational complexity resulting in excellent efficiency. DISTPAB provides high classification accuracy, which is close to that of the accuracy of classification performed with the original data. DISTPAB provides high attack resistance outperforming rotation perturbation and geometric perturbation. It was also shown that the data produced by DISTPAB is not subjected to utility degradation, against the number of distributed entities. DISTPAB can be an excellent privacy preservation algorithm for distributed machine learning.</p>

To achieve this, we will investigate on the vertical federated learning scheme where the distributed clients have different feature spaces. Vertical federated learning allows dividing a particular dataset into partitions by the attributes leaving a specific client to work only on a fewer number of attributes, which can improve efficiency.</p>
