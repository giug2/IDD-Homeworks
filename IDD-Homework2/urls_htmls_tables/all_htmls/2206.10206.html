<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Subgraphs of a larger global graph may be distributed across multiple devices, and only locally accessible due to privacy restrictions, although there may be links between subgraphs. Recently proposed subgraph Federated Learning (FL) methods deal with those missing links across local subgraphs while distributively training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on them. However, they have overlooked the inevitable heterogeneity between subgraphs comprising different <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communities</span> of a global graph, consequently collapsing the incompatible knowledge from local GNN models. To this end, we introduce a new subgraph FL problem, <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized subgraph FL</span>, which focuses on the joint improvement of the interrelated local GNNs rather than learning a single global model, and propose a novel framework, <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning</span> (FED-PUB), to tackle it. Since the server cannot access the subgraph in each client, FED-PUB utilizes functional embeddings of the local GNNs using random graphs as inputs to compute similarities between them, and use the similarities to perform weighted averaging for server-side aggregation. Further, it learns a personalized sparse mask at each client to select and update only the subgraph-relevant subset of the aggregated parameters. We validate our FED-PUB for its subgraph FL performance on six datasets, considering both non-overlapping and overlapping subgraphs, on which it significantly outperforms relevant baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/JinheonBaek/FED-PUB.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamilton, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> focus on a single graph, whose nodes and edges collected from multiple sources are stored in a central server. For instance, in a social network platform, every user, with his/her social networks, contributes to creating a giant network consisting of all users and their connections. However, in some practical scenarios, each user/institution collects its own private graph, which is only locally accessible due to privacy restrictions. For instance, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, each hospital may have its own patient interaction network to track their physical contacts or co-diagnosis of disease; however, this graph may not be shared with others. How can we then collaboratively train, without sharing actual data, GNNs, when the subgraphs are distributed across multiple participants (i.e., clients)? The most straightforward way is to perform Federated Learning (FL) with GNNs, where each client individually trains a local GNN on the local data, while a central server aggregates locally updated GNN weights from multiple clients into one.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, an important challenge on it is how to deal with potentially <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">missing edges</span> between subgraphs that are not captured by individual data owners, but may carry important information (See Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (A)). Recent subgraph FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> tackle this problem by expanding the local subgraph from other subgraphs, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (B). Specifically, they expand the local subgraph either by exactly augmenting the relevant nodes from the other subgraphs at the other clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>, or by estimating the nodes using the node information in the other subgraphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, such sharing of node information may compromise data privacy and can incur high communication costs.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Also, there exists a more important challenge that has been overlooked by the existing subgraph FL methods. We observe that they suffer from large performance degeneration (See Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> right), due to the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneity</span> among subgraphs, which is natural since subgraphs comprise different parts of a global graph. Specifically, two individual subgraphs – for example, User 1 and 3 subgraphs in Communities A and B, respectively, in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (A) – are sometimes completely disjoint, having opposite properties. Meanwhile, two densely connected subgraphs form a community (e.g., User 1 and 2 subgraphs within the Community A of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (A)), in which they share similar characteristics. However, it is challenging to consider such heterogeneity arising from the community structures of a graph in subgraph FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a novel problem of <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized subgraph FL</em>, whose goal is to jointly improve the interrelated local models trained on the interconnected local subgraphs, for instance, subgraphs belonging to the same community, by sharing weights among them (See Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (C)). However, realizing such selective weight sharing is challenging, since we do not know which subgraph each client has, due to its local accessibility. To address this issue, we use functional embeddings of GNNs on random graphs to obtain similarity scores between two local GNNs, and then use them to perform weighted averaging of the model parameters at the server. However, the similarity scores only tell how relevant each local model from the other clients is, but not which of the parameters are relevant. Thus we further learn and apply personalized sparse masks on the local GNN at each client to obtain only the subnetwork, relevant to the local subgraph. We refer to this framework as <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning</span> (FED-PUB).</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</span>, which aim to learn the representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs, are an extensively studied topic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamilton, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhou et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>; Jo et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Baek et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Most existing GNNs under a message passing scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gilmer et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> iteratively represent a node by aggregating features from its neighboring nodes as well as itself. For example, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kipf &amp; Welling, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> approximates the spectral graph convolutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hammond et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, yielding a mean aggregation over neighboring nodes. Similarly, for each node, GraphSAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamilton et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> aggregates the features from its neighbors to update the node representation. While they lead to successes on node classification and link prediction tasks for a single graph, they are not directly applicable to real-world systems with locally distributed graphs, where graphs from different sources are not shared across participants, which gives rise to federated learning to train GNNs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite> is essential for our distributed subgraph learning problem. To mention a few, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> locally trains a model for each client and then transmits the trained model to a server, while the server aggregates the model weights from local clients and then sends the aggregated model back to them. However, since the locally collected data may largely vary across different clients, heterogeneity is a crucial issue. To tackle this, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposes the regularization term that minimizes the weight differences between local and global models, which prevents the local model from diverging to the local training data. However, when the local data is extremely heterogeneous, it is more appropriate to collaboratively train a personalized model for each client rather than learning a single global model. FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Arivazhagan et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> is such a method, which shares base layers while having local personalized layers for each client, to keep the local knowledge. Further, recent studies propose to distill the outputs from different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, or directly minimize the differences of their model outputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Makhija et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. However, unlike the commonly studied image and text data, graph-structured data is defined by connections between instances, which yields additional challenges: missing edges, and community structures between private subgraphs.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Graph Federated Learning.</span>
Few recent studies suggest using the FL framework to collaboratively train GNNs without sharing graph data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which can be broadly classified into subgraph- and graph-level methods. Graph-level FL methods assume that different clients have completely disjoint graphs (e.g., molecular graphs), and recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xie et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; He et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> focuses on the heterogeneity among non-IID graphs (i.e., differences in graph labels across clients). Unlike the graph-level FL that has similar challenges to general FL scenarios, the subgraph-level FL we target has a unique graph-structural challenge: there exist missing yet probable links between subgraphs, since a subgraph is a part of a larger global graph. To deal with such a missing link problem among subgraphs, existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Yao &amp; Joe-Wong, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> augment the nodes by requesting the node information in the other subgraphs, and then connecting the existing nodes with the augmented ones. However, this scheme may compromise data privacy constraints, and also increases communication overhead across clients, during the node information sharing process. Unlike them focusing on the problem of missing links, our subgraph FL method tackles the new problem with a completely different perspective by exploring subgraph communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Girvan &amp; Newman, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>; Radicchi et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>, which are groups of densely connected subgraphs.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.8" class="ltx_p">To address these limitations, we propose to measure the functional similarity of GNNs by feeding the same input to all GNN models and then calculating the similarities using their outputs, inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Jeong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. The main intuition here is that we can consider the transformation defined with a neural network as a function, and we measure the functional similarity of two networks by the distance of their outputs for the same input. However, unlike the previous work, which uses Gaussian noises as inputs for image classification, we use random graphs as inputs as we work with GNNs.

Note that entirely ignoring the model parameters from different communities may result in exploiting only the local objective while ignoring the globally useful weights, which results in suboptimal performance (See Appendix <a href="#A3.SS8" title="C.8 Analyses on Implicit and Explicit Communities in Weight Aggregation ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.8</span></a>). Therefore, we perform weighted averaging of local GNNs from all clients based on their functional similarities, as follows (Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Federated Learning ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (B)):</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This personalized scheme handles two challenges in subgraph FL. First, unlike the global weight aggregation which collapses the knowledge from heterogeneous communities, our subgraph FL allows the models belonging to different communities to obtain individual parameters that are beneficial for each of both communities. Also, missing edges (i.e., a lack of information sharing) between interconnected subgraphs, which are explicitly dealt with by expanding local subgraphs in existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, could be implicitly handled by largely sharing the knowledge among GNNs of probably linked subgraphs within the same community (See Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, and Appendix <a href="#A3.SS9" title="C.9 Impacts of Missing Edges to Performance Degeneration ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.9</span></a> for results).

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the previous similarity matching scheme, we can effectively group GNNs that belong to the same community; therefore, preventing the collapsing of irrelevant knowledge from opposite communities. However, the heterogeneity in subgraph FL is extremely severe due to the community structures (See Appendix <a href="#A3.SS4" title="C.4 Analyses on Distribution Shifts Between Subgraphs with Sparse Masks ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.4</span></a> for more discussions). Therefore, the previous scalar weighting scheme might be insufficient, since it considers only how much each local model from other clients is relevant, but not <em id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">which</em> parameters are relevant. Thus we propose to select only the relevant parameters from the aggregated GNN weights transmitted from a server, similar to the existing weight masking literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Dai et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Huang et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the experimental setup from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, we construct distributed subgraphs by dividing the dataset into a certain number of participants, as each FL participant has a subgraph that is a part of an original graph. Specifically, we use six datasets: Cora, CiteSeer, Pubmed and ogbn-arxiv for citation graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sen et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>; Computer and Photo for product graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McAuley et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Shchur et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. We then divide their graphs using the METIS graph partitioning algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karypis, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite>. Note that, unlike the Louvain algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Blondel et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>, used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, that requires to further merge partitioned subgraphs into particular numbers of subgraphs since it cannot specify the number of subsets (i.e., clients for FL), the METIS algorithm can specify the number of subsets, thus making more reasonable experimental settings (See Appendix <a href="#A3.SS2" title="C.2 Results on Louvain Graph Partitioning Algorithm ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.2</span></a>). For the non-overlapping node scenario where there are no duplicate nodes between subgraphs, we use the output from the METIS as it provides non-overlapping partitions. For the overlapping scenario where nodes are duplicated among subgraphs, we randomly sample the subsets (i.e., subgraphs) of the partitioned graph multiple times. See Appendix <a href="#A2.SS1" title="B.1 Datasets ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a> for more details.</p>

Specifically, while FedGNN and FedSage+ are two pioneer works for subgraph FL, they are inferior to personalized FL methods including ours, especially at the larger number of clients. This is surprising as they share node information between clients for handling the missing edge problem, yet we suppose such inferior performance comes from naive averaging of local weights without consideration of community structures. While personalized FL baselines including FedPer and GCFL show decent performance by alleviating the knowledge collapse issue between subgraphs with local parameterization or clustering, they still underperform ours as they are not concerned with aggregation between similar subgraphs that form a community (i.e., GCFL uses a bi-partitioning scheme, which iteratively divides a group of subgraphs within the same community into two disjoint sets). We then further conduct experiments on the disjoint subgraph scenario (i.e., non-overlapping scenario), which makes the subgraph FL problem more heterogeneous. As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Datasets ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the proposed FED-PUB consistently outperforms all existing baselines in such a challenging scenario, demonstrating the efficacy of ours.</p>

We conjecture that this is because ours can accurately identify subgraphs forming the community and then share weights substantially across them for promoting the joint improvement. Also, ours can mask out subgraph-irrelevant weights received from the server for localization to local subgraphs. We demonstrate those two points in the next two paragraphs.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To analyze the contribution of each component, we conduct ablation studies. As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we observe that each of our similarity matching and weight masking schemes significantly improves the performance from the naive FedAvg, while the performance is much improved when using both together. However, the benefit from each component is different between overlapping and non-overlapping scenarios. In particular, in the former scenario where a group of densely overlapped subgraphs comprises an obvious community, similarity matching for discovering community structures is more beneficial since capturing the community would promote the joint improvement of subgraphs belonging to the same community. However, in the non-overlapping scenario, two individual subgraphs become more heterogeneous, thus selectively using the aggregated parameters from the server with personalized weight masks improves the performance substantially.

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another notable advantage of using sparse masks is that we can reduce the communication costs at every FL round, as well as the model size for faster runtime. In particular, as reported in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Figure 9 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, existing subgraph FL methods require more than two times larger communications costs, measured by adding both the client-to-server and server-to-client costs, compared against the naive FedAvg. This is because they require to transfer additional node information between clients for estimating the probable nodes on each subgraph. In contrast, our FED-PUB has significantly lower communication costs and lower model sizes by using sparse masks on model weights: transmitting and running with only the partial parameters not sparsified at the client. Further, we can manage the trade-off between the model sparsity and the performance by controlling the hyperparameter for sparsity regularization, <math id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">λ</mi><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px5.p1.1.m1.1c">\lambda_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> (See Appendix <a href="#A3.SS1" title="C.1 Results on Varying Scaling Hyperparameters in Loss Function ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.1</span></a> for more results on hyperparameters).</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Varying Local Epochs</h4>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, when we increase the number of communication rounds and the local steps, local models diverge to their local subgraphs (i.e., overfitting), due to the small number of training instances and the direct connection between training and test nodes: struggling to generalize to the test instances. However, our FED-PUB with a proximal term in equation <a href="#S4.E4" title="Equation 4 ‣ Preventing Local Divergence with Proximal Term ‣ 4.2 Adaptive Weight Masking ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> alleviates this issue, therefore, maintaining the highest local performance. Notably, the performance with five local epochs is inferior to the performance of one epoch, which indicates that increasing the local epochs does not always bring advantages, and properly tuning them is important for subgraph FL.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The missing edge problem, where two interconnected subgraphs cannot directly share the knowledge between them due to a lack of edges, is a unique challenge in subgraph FL (See Appendix <a href="#A3.SS9" title="C.9 Impacts of Missing Edges to Performance Degeneration ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.9</span></a> for more discussions). To tackle this, existing subgraph FL explicitly augments nodes and edges to enable the information flow between interconnected subgraphs. Meanwhile, our FED-PUB implicitly shares weights across similar subgraphs within the same community. To measure their efficacies, we evaluate the performance on the neighboring subgraph, which has the most missing edges to the local subgraph for each client, based on its local model weight. Specifically, in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, (Neighbor) denotes the subgraph performance evaluated by its neighbor model, while (Local) denotes the performance by its own local model. Therefore, high performances on the (Neighbor) measure indicate two associated subgraphs share meaningful knowledge despite not having actual edges between them, thereby alleviating the missing edge problem. As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, FED-PUB achieves superior performance on neighboring subgraphs against subgraph FL baselines. This result verifies that our FED-PUB has an advantage on the missing edge problem by sharing meaningful knowledge between subgraphs having potential missing edges without explicitly augmenting them.</p>

However, real-world subgraphs might have variances in size; therefore, in Table <a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Varying Local Epochs ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, we further conduct experiments on the imbalance node scenarios where different subgraphs have different numbers of nodes. To do this, we create the imbalanced dataset by equally dividing the entire graph into several subgraphs and then merging some of them for making imbalanced subgraphs. More specifically, for our ten client setting in Table <a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Varying Local Epochs ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, we first partition an original graph into 20 subgraphs.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the extensive experiments on the node classification task, we further perform experiments on the link prediction task. In this link prediction task, we use the cross-entropy loss in Equation <a href="#S4.E4" title="Equation 4 ‣ Preventing Local Divergence with Proximal Term ‣ 4.2 Adaptive Weight Masking ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, which is the same as the loss function for the node classification task yet the target value is binary. Further, during training, we sample negative edges with random sampling whose sizes are the same as the number of positive edges in the same batch. For evaluation, we measure the link prediction performance with ROC-AUC as a metric on all subgraphs, and then report their averaged result. Note that, for the other experimental setups, we follow the experimental settings of node classification tasks described in Section <a href="#A2.SS3" title="B.3 Implementation Details ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.3</span></a>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduced a novel problem of personalized subgraph FL, which focuses on the joint improvement of local GNNs working on interrelated subgraphs (e.g. subgraphs belonging to the same community) by selectively utilizing knowledge from other models. The proposed personalized subgraph FL is highly challenging due to 1) the difficulty in computing similarities between local subgraphs that are only locally accessible, and 2) the problem of knowledge collapse among local GNNs that work on heterogeneous subgraphs during weight aggregation. To this end, we proposed a novel personalized subgraph FL framework, called FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning (FED-PUB), which estimates similarities between subgraphs using functional embeddings of their GNN models on random graphs, and uses them to perform a weighted average of the local models for each client. Further, we mask out globally given weights to focus on only the relevant subnetwork for each community and client. We extensively validated our FED-PUB framework on multiple benchmark datasets with overlapping and non-overlapping subgraphs, on which our FED-PUB significantly outperforms relevant baselines. Further analyses show the effectiveness of our similarity matching method for capturing the community structures, and also our weight masking strategy for tackling the subgraph heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="A2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We report statistics of six different benchmark datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sen et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; McAuley et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Shchur et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, such as Cora, CiteSeer, Pubmed, and ogbn-arxiv for citation graphs; Computer and Photo for amazon product graphs, which we use in our experiments, for both the overlapping and non-overlapping node scenarios in Table <a href="#A2.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Specifically, in Table <a href="#A2.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we report the number of nodes, edges, classes, and clustering coefficient for each subgraph, but also the heterogeneity between the subgraphs. Note that, to measure the clustering coefficient, which indicates how much nodes are clustered together, for the individual subgraph, we first calculate the clustering coefficient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Watts &amp; Strogatz, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite> for all nodes, and then average them. On the other hand, to measure the heterogeneity, which indicates how disjointed subgraphs are dissimilar, we calculate the median Jenson-Shannon divergence of label distributions between all pairs of subgraphs.</p>

<div id="A2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For dataset splits, we randomly sample 20% nodes for training, 35% for validation, and 35% for testing, for all datasets except for the arxiv dataset. This is because the arxiv dataset has a relatively larger number of nodes compared to the other datasets, as reported in Table <a href="#A2.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Therefore, for this dataset, we randomly sample 5% nodes for training, the remaining half of the nodes for validation, and the other nodes for testing.</p>

<div id="A2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We then describe how to partition the original graph into multiple subgraphs, whose number is the same as the number of clients (i.e., FL participants). In general, we use the METIS graph partitioning algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karypis, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite> to divide the original graph into multiple subgraphs, which can control the number of disjoint subgraphs as parameters. Consequently, in the non-overlapping node scenario, the disjoint subgraph for each client is directly obtained by the output of the METIS algorithm (i.e., if we set the parameter value for METIS as 10, then we can obtain 10 different disjoint subgraphs, each of which is given to each client). On the other hand, in the overlapping node scenario where nodes are duplicated across different subgraphs, we first divide the original graph into 2, 6, and 10 disjoint subgraphs for 10 clients, 30 clients, and 50 clients, respectively, with the METIS algorithm. After that, in each split subgraph, we randomly sample half of the nodes and their associated edges, and then use them as the subgraph for one particular client. This procedure is performed five times to generate five different yet overlapped subgraphs, per one split subgraph obtained from METIS.</p>

In our non-overlapping node scenario, since nodes are disjoint across clients, we measure the similarities between nodes of different clients and augment them having the similarity above the threshold (e.g., 0.5).</p>

<div id="A2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The functional embeddings are key ingredients in the proposed FED-PUB framework, to capture community structures of interconnected subgraphs leveraged in personalized weight aggregation (See Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Subgraph Similarity Estimation ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>). To obtain such functional embeddings, the input of GNNs is important, which we randomly generates via a stochastic block model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Holland et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">1983</a>)</cite>. Specifically, we first sample five individual subgraphs, each of which has 100 nodes, in which the probability of edges within the single graph is 0.1, while the probability of edges between different graphs is 0.01. Also, we initialize the node features with the normal distribution of 0.0 mean and 1.0 variance. Note that, in practice, this randomly sampled graph is initialized on the server-side at once, and the server distributes it to all clients. Then, the client calculates its model’s functional embedding, and then transmits it to the server. However, the effect is the same even if we calculate the functional embeddings on the server-side, which is up to the FL system design.</p>

In communities, each subgraph consists of 30 nodes, and the edges between two nodes in the same community are sampled from the probability of 0.5.

We use two types of GPUs: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and TITAN XP, for training models. Note that the runtime of our framework depends on the number of workers for processing clients’ jobs in parallel. In general, we use 10 or 20 workers (i.e., simultaneously training 10 or 20 local models for 10 or 20 clients), and, based on 10 workers, the single run of our FED-PUB for training 50 clients with 1 local epoch and 100 total rounds takes less than 2 hours.</p>

<div id="A3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate our FED-PUB framework on different graph partitioning settings for subgraph FL, we use another experimental setup from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which uses Louvain algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Blondel et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> to partition the entire graph into several subgraphs for FL clients. Before explaining experimental results, we would like to point out that there is a drawback in the Louvain algorithm presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, unlike the METIS algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karypis, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite> that we use, for subgraph FL scenarios. Specifically, since the Louvain algorithm cannot specify the number of graph partitions, the number of subgraphs on the CiteSeer dataset is 38, where three of them have less than ten nodes. Then, based on those 38 disjoint subgraphs, to generate the particular number of clients (e.g., 10), <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> randomly merge the different subgraphs without considering their graph properties. Therefore, even though each partitioned subgraph has its unique structural role/characteristic, the reconstructed 10 subgraphs from the original 38 subgraphs have mixed properties (i.e., two incompatible subgraphs could be merged), which is suboptimal and might be unrealistic. However, as described in the Datasets paragraph of Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>, the METIS that we use can specify the number of subgraph partitions; therefore, METIS is more appropriate when making the experimental settings for subgraph FL.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">C.3 </span>Results on Random Graph Partitioning Algorithm</h3>

<div id="A3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One might be curious about experimental results on the uniform partitions of graphs, instead of splitting the graph with sophisticated partitioning algorithms (e.g., METIS and Louvain algorithms). Therefore, in this subsection, we explain why the random graph partitioning setting is unrealistic, and further show the performances on this random setting. To be specific, if we partition the entire graph of the CiteSeer dataset into different subgraphs uniformly at random, the number of nodes of each subgraph is larger than the number of edges (e.g., 211 nodes yet 72 edges per subgraph, thus some nodes do not have any edges), which is uncommon in practice. Nonetheless, we further perform experiments on the random split setting with 10 different clients on the CiteSeer dataset. As shown in Table <a href="#A3.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ C.2 Results on Louvain Graph Partitioning Algorithm ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the gap between baselines and our model is reduced compared to the non-overlapping and overlapping scenarios in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Personalized Parameter Masking ‣ 4.2 Adaptive Weight Masking ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Datasets ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. This is because there are no specific community structures in this random graph partitioning setting; however, our FED-PUB still consistently outperforms all baselines.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">C.4 </span>Analyses on Distribution Shifts Between Subgraphs with Sparse Masks</h3>

<div id="A3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To see the distributional shifts between subgraphs in the subgraph FL task, we measure distributional differences of labels between subgraphs with the Jenson-Shannon divergence on the Cora dataset with 20 different clients over the overlapping and non-overlapping scenarios. Then, the experimental results show that the distance (i.e., divergence value) among subgraphs within the same community is 0.384, meanwhile, the distance between subgraphs belonging to different communities is 0.639 for the non-overlapping node scenario. On the other hand, for the overlapping node scenario, the distance among subgraphs within the same community is 0.047, meanwhile, the distance between subgraphs belonging to different communities is 0.528. Thus, these results confirm that the heterogeneity of subgraphs even within the same community is extremely larger in the non-overlapping setup (0.384) compared to the overlapping setup (0.047).</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Then, from the above results, we can further argue that personalized weight aggregation based on similarity matching for discovering community structures is not sufficient in disjoint subgraph FL problems, since the model weight received from the completely heterogeneous subgraphs might not be meaningful to the local subgraph task, especially in the non-overlapping setting. However, in this extremely heterogeneous scenario, a personalized weight masking scheme is obviously helpful, since it can filter out irrelevant information transmitted from the other heterogeneous subgraphs, while allowing the model to maintain the locally helpful information in its parameters with sparse local masks. This claim and result on the heterogeneity are also aligned with the results in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>: ablation study, which shows that the personalized weight masking scheme brings huge performance improvements in the non-overlapping setting (i.e., high heterogeneity between subgraphs), whereas the personalized weight aggregation scheme is more beneficial in the overlapping setting with low heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, to more closely look at the efficacy of sparse masks in subgraph FL, we empirically analyze whether they can indeed filter out irrelevant weights received from the heterogeneous communities and subgraphs. To do so, we measure how many parameters are shared between the two most dissimilar (i.e., heterogeneous) subgraphs, as well as between the two most similar subgraphs, for the Cora dataset with 20 clients on the non-overlapping node scenario. For the two most similar subgraphs within the same community, 75% parameters are shared. Meanwhile, for the two heterogeneous subgraphs from two opposite communities, 73% parameters are filtered by sparse masks (i.e., only 27% parameters are shared). These results demonstrate that sparse masks can prevent the knowledge collapse from subgraphs of heterogeneous communities.</p>

<p id="A3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To see how much severe the heterogeneity issues are in terms of the number of clients, we first analyze the exact amount of heterogeneities with respect to the client numbers.

<div id="A3.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As described in Section <a href="#A2.SS3" title="B.3 Implementation Details ‣ Appendix B Experimental Setups ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.3</span></a>, to obtain the functional embedding of GNNs, we use the same random graphs for all clients, where random graphs are initialized by the stochastic block model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Holland et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">1983</a>)</cite> with node features initialized by the normal distribution. We note the underlying assumption on using random graphs is that such randomness may not yield any bias on the functional space, unlike existing node features of the certain subgraph. In other words, we expect that our random graphs are helpful for effectively capturing the similarities and community structures among subgraphs without having bias on any particular graph structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, to experimentally validate the above statement, we further compare various graph inputs used for calculating the functional embeddings, listed as follows: 1) SBM denotes the random graphs generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) like ours; 2) ER denotes the random graphs generated by the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Erdős &amp; Rényi, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">1960</a>)</cite>; 3) One denotes the random graph having only one node; 4) Feature denotes the graph where node features are initialized by the existing ones in the client. We then measure the performances of those four schemes by calculating the correlation coefficient between label distributions and estimated similarities of subgraphs (i.e., the high correlation coefficient means that the estimated similarities from functional embeddings are similar to the actual label distributions) on the Cora dataset of non-overlapping and overlapping node scenarios with 20 clients, which are reported in Table <a href="#A3.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ C.5 Analyses on Local Graph Size vs Heterogeneity ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. Specifically, as shown in Table <a href="#A3.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ C.5 Analyses on Local Graph Size vs Heterogeneity ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, compared to the One scheme that uses only one node for calculating the functional embeddings, SBM and ER schemes that use more large numbers of randomly initialized nodes can accurately capture the similarities between subgraphs. This result demonstrates that a sufficient amount of randomness is required to capture the model’s functional space. Also, compared to the Feature scheme that uses existing node representations to calculate the functional embeddings, SBM and ER random models show superiority in capturing similarities among subgraphs, which verifies that randomness indeed helps obtain accurate functional embeddings of models without incurring bias.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">C.7 </span>Results on Varying Similarity Estimation Mechanisms</h3>

<div id="A3.SS7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Personalized Subgraph FL ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, our functional embeddings are not only effective but also efficient in capturing similarities between subgraphs, compared against using the parameter and gradient similarities. Additionally, one might consider using label distributions as the proxy for similarity estimation between local subgraphs; however, this scheme may violate the privacy constraint of FL since subgraph labels are private local data stored in the client. Nevertheless, to see its actual performances, we additionally conduct experiments with the label similarities that are calculated by distributional differences between subgraph labels, on the Cora dataset of the overlapping node scenario with the number of clients as 30, and then compare the results with our functional similarities at 20, 40, 60, and 80 rounds.</p>

This is because they struggle to discover similar subgraphs within the community due to the curse of dimensionality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bellman, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1966</a>)</cite> (See Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Personalized Subgraph FL ‣ 3 Problem Statement ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). On the other hand, even though the label similarity model uses privacy-sensitive local information (i.e., label distributions of clients), the performance of our FED-PUB that utilizes the functional embeddings from the privacy-free random graphs is similar to the performance of the label model. Therefore, along with the results in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Main Results ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, these comparison results on similarity schemes further verify the effectiveness of our functional embedding in capturing similarities among subgraphs, for identifying their communities.</p>

<p id="A3.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As formalized in Equation <a href="#S4.E3" title="Equation 3 ‣ Personalized Weight Aggregation ‣ 4.1 Subgraph Similarity Estimation ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and described in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Subgraph Similarity Estimation ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, we implicitly model the community structures by performing weight aggregation over all available clients. However, one can alternatively perform the explicit weight aggregation, by grouping similar subgraphs within the community first and then performing weight aggregation exclusively among clients discovered within the same community. To see which strategy is superior, we compare the performances of our model variants: implicit and explicit community detection, in personalized weight aggregation. Specifically, for the implicit setup, we use the formulation defined in Equation <a href="#S4.E3" title="Equation 3 ‣ Personalized Weight Aggregation ‣ 4.1 Subgraph Similarity Estimation ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> without any modification. Meanwhile, for the explicit setup, we exclusively perform weight aggregation between clients, having a functional similarity score above 0.5, which we regard as forming the community. Note that, for those two variants, we use the same normalization trick in Equation <a href="#S4.E3" title="Equation 3 ‣ Personalized Weight Aggregation ‣ 4.1 Subgraph Similarity Estimation ‣ 4 Federated Personalized Subgraph Learning ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> after identifying communities, and also the same random graph inputs for obtaining functional embeddings.</p>

We believe such an exceptional case on the Cora dataset with the overlapping node scenario might be because, the information in the other communities is especially not useful for this particular setup (i.e., the model might capture necessary knowledge only with subgraphs within the same community); therefore, completely ignoring the information from other communities contributes to the improved performance. Except for this case, the results in Table <a href="#A3.T11" title="Table 11 ‣ C.7 Results on Varying Similarity Estimation Mechanisms ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> confirm that implicit modeling of community structures is generally better for personalized weight aggregation in subgraph FL.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">C.9 </span>Impacts of Missing Edges to Performance Degeneration</h3>

<div id="A3.SS9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we empirically demonstrate how much the performance is degenerated due to the missing edge problem, and how much the performance gain we obtain when we train with missing edges. In this work, we mainly conjecture that, due to the crucial issue of missing edges in subgraph FL, all FL methods that observe edges only within each subgraph show inferior performances to the Oracle method that trains on the entire graph including missing edges. To validate this claim, we first train the Oracle model on the connected global graph, and then evaluate it on disjoint subgraphs over all clients, on the Cora dataset of both Non-overlapping and Overlapping node scenarios with varying the number of clients. Note that this Oracle method is unrealistic in subgraph FL since it observes missing edges between subgraphs of distributed clients; therefore, this method is designed only for revealing the degenerated performance from missing edges and is not comparable to other FL methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS9.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS9.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Table <a href="#A3.T12" title="Table 12 ‣ C.8 Analyses on Implicit and Explicit Communities in Weight Aggregation ‣ Appendix C Additional Experimental Results ‣ Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, the Oracle model outperforms all the other methods, while our FED-PUB achieves the closest performance to the Oracle. The above results bring us to conclude that, due to the problem of missing edges, all FL methods, which train with edges only within each subgraph, are inferior to the Oracle method. Also, this concluding result further suggests that the missing edge problem negatively affects the incompatible knowledge issue. Specifically, since all client models are trained on partial subgraphs, which are parts of the larger global graph, the trained parameters in the client and the aggregated parameters in the server might not capture globally meaningful knowledge that is helpful to all the other clients, while the Oracle model can capture. Therefore, the Oracle model can obtain superior performance to FL methods.</p>

<p id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While our personalized subgraph FL framework, namely FED-PUB, is generally applicable regardless of subgraph types (e.g., unipartite graphs or bipartite graphs), our experiments are mainly done with unipartite graphs, since they are the most popular setups. However, the efficacy of our FED-PUB on the other types of graphs, such as bipartite graphs, would be interesting to investigate, which have not been explored much so far, and we leave this as future work.</p>

<p id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FL mechanism is important for preserving user’s privacy, and, while this mechanism is actively studied in image and language domains, it gets little attention in graphs. However, we believe that our work comprehensively investigates and sufficiently tackles unique challenges in subgraph FL, such as missing nodes, edges, and their community structures, by proposing the novel approaches of using functional embeddings and local sparse masks.</p>

<p id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The potential positive impact of our work on society is that, our FED-PUB can contribute to various domains that utilize graph-structured data, such as social, recommendation, and patient networks. Here we would like to emphasize the importance of our subgraph FL method, especially in social and recommendation networks. In current real-world applications, all user’s interactions with other users in social networks and with other products in recommendation networks may be stored on the server. However, this may not preserve the user’s privacy, but also has potential risks of user data leakage from the server, such that storing user’s data in the server is not recommended by the existing data protection regularizations such as GDPR <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://gdpr-info.eu/</span></span></span>. Yet, by applying our subgraph FL framework to this domain, we expect such problems could be alleviated by not storing user’s interaction data in the server, but sharing only the locally trained machine learning models from client subgraphs.</p>
