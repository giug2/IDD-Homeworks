<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a personalized graph federated learning (PGFL) framework in which distributedly connected servers and their respective edge devices collaboratively learn device or cluster-specific models while maintaining the privacy of every individual device. The proposed approach exploits similarities among different models to provide a more relevant experience for each device, even in situations with diverse data distributions and disproportionate datasets. Furthermore, to ensure a secure and efficient approach to collaborative personalized learning, we study a variant of the PGFL implementation that utilizes differential privacy, specifically zero-concentrated differential privacy, where a noise sequence perturbs model exchanges. Our mathematical analysis shows that the proposed privacy-preserving PGFL algorithm converges to the optimal cluster-specific solution for each cluster in linear time. It also shows that exploiting similarities among clusters leads to an alternative output whose distance to the original solution is bounded, and that this bound can be adjusted by modifying the algorithm’s hyperparameters. Further, our analysis shows that the algorithm ensures local differential privacy for all clients in terms of zero-concentrated differential privacy. Finally, the performance of the proposed PGFL algorithm is examined by performing numerical experiments in the context of regression and classification using synthetic data and the MNIST dataset.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rise of internet-of-things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems has led to exponential growth in data collection from distributed devices. However, transferring this massive amount of data to a centralized processing point for inference and decision-making is often impractical due to resource constraints and privacy concerns. To overcome these challenges, distributed learning, with its on-device processing, is an attractive alternative, enabling efficient data analysis without moving the raw data out of the edge devices. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that facilitates collaborative model training across edge devices or clients without exposing the underlying data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In particular, using its local data, each client refines a global model shared by a server, and subsequently transfers the updated model back to the server which then aggregates all updated client models before sending an update back to clients for further refinements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To date, research on FL mostly uses a single-server architecture, which is susceptible to communication and computation bottlenecks and scales poorly with the number and geographical dispersion of participating clients. To address these concerns, some alternatives to the single-server architecture have been proposed, see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, such as client-edge-server hierarchical learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and the graph federated architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In client-edge-server hierarchical learning, edge servers perform partial aggregation with their associated clients and communicate their results to a single cloud server that performs the global aggregation. However, using a single cloud server is susceptible to bottlenecks and can only accommodate up to a limited number of edge servers. In contrast, the graph federated architecture uses a server network in which each server aggregates the information from its associated clients and shares its model with its neighbors. Therefore, the graph federated architecture is highly scalable with the number of clients and easier to implement, thanks to its distributed nature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main challenges in FL is data heterogeneity, which means there can be substantial differences in the underlying statistical distributions among clients’ data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Consequently, a unique globally shared model can be inadequate for such settings, and personalized models must be learned instead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For example, autonomous vehicles need to maintain vehicle-specific models of their highly dynamic environment while collaborating with nearby vehicles and/or smart city IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This requirement can be met by personalized FL, where clients, or groups of clients (clusters), learn client- or cluster-specific models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. These personalized models typically share some similarities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. As an example, the environment of an autonomous vehicle could be shared with other connected objects. Leveraging the similarities between cluster-specific models can, therefore, improve performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a process known as inter-cluster learning, which is particularly important when some clients or clusters have insufficient data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Personalized FL has received considerable attention lately due to its ability to improve learning performance in settings where clients are required to observe device-specific behaviors, see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. It is used in many applications such as healthcare, electrical load forecasting, biometrics, drone swarms, and autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, all those works are limited to single-server cases. For example, although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> extends personalized FL to a multi-server architecture, it assumes that all the clients associated with a given server learn the same model. Under this assumption, each server maintains a single model trained via conventional FL and the model is refined by communicating with other servers about their models. However, the general case where each distributed server needs to enable the learning of personalized models and collaborate with its neighbors to refine those, is yet to be studied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of graph FL, many devices take part in the training process, and ensuring the privacy and security of client data is crucial. The risk of eavesdropping attacks on the client-server channels increases with the number of devices in the system, and not all devices can be trusted. Even if data is not explicitly shared among clients, repeated message exchanges could reveal sensitive information to curious devices or external eavesdroppers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In order to reduce this risk, differential privacy (DP) has been introduced to protect client privacy by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of an individual data sample does not significantly affect the algorithm output. In other words, DP limits the ability of attackers to infer information about individual data samples by adding controlled noise to the data before sharing it with the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In particular, the zero-concentrated DP (zCDP) variant is well-suited for iterative implementations, as it allows the privacy budget to be adjusted dynamically based on the number of iterations
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Therefore, this paper considers zCDP in the graph FL architecture where the privacy of client data is of utmost importance. By employing zCDP, clients perturb their local model estimates with a noise sequence of known variance that decreases progressively throughout the computation to ensure privacy without compromising model accuracy.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This manuscript tackles the general case of personalized graph federated learning (PGFL) in both a conventional and privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, we consider a multi-server architecture with distributed clients grouped into clusters, irrespective of their associated servers, for the decentralized training of cluster-specific personalized models. The proposed algorithms, within the considered PGFL architecture, leverage similarities between clusters to mitigate data scarcity and improve learning performance. The local training in the proposed framework uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), well-suited for distributed applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and demonstrating fast, often linear <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, convergence.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">To address task variations, personalized (cluster) models are preferable. However, despite these differences, the underlying relationship among tasks, or equivalently, clusters, can still be exploited in decentralized learning. Here, we consider a modified regularized empirical risk minimization problem to leverage similarities among the clusters. For this purpose, we introduce an additional regularizer function that enforces similarity among the cluster-specific personalized models. This additional regularizer function corresponds to inter-cluster learning and is controlled by the inter-cluster learning parameter <math id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau\in(0,1)" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml">τ</mi><mo id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">∈</mo><mrow id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.2.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mn id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.2.3" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3"><in id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.1"></in><ci id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.2">𝜏</ci><interval closure="open" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.3.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2">1</cn></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.2c">\tau\in(0,1)</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The above multi-step mechanism has two main advantages. First, performing server aggregation prior to inter-server aggregation enables the servers to maintain models composed of the last available client estimates. Second, the fact that inter-cluster learning is performed at the end of the multi-step mechanism ensures that model similarities are leveraged evenly; that is, the same weight is given to any two clients’ estimates within the server neighborhood.

The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed PGFL algorithm over FedAvg, as cluster-specific learning tasks benefit significantly from personalized models tailored to each cluster. We also see that incorporating inter-cluster learning results in improved convergence speed and steady-state accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the PGFL algorithm is notably poor in the absence of inter-server communication, emphasizing the importance of using the graph federated architecture. Leveraging the model similarities improves learning speed and accuracy by compensating for data scarcity. In addition, isolated servers whose clients lack sufficient data to achieve satisfactory accuracy independently reinforce the necessity of the graph federated architecture.</p>

We observe that the PGFL algorithm exhibits slower convergence and higher steady-state NMSD when utilizing client scheduling. And we note that FedAvg performs better with client scheduling. The performance degradation for the PGFL algorithm is due to the lower client participation resulting in a smaller quantity of data being utilized. The better performance of FedAvg in this setting is due to the imbalance of cluster representation in the universal model, which benefits the participating clients on average.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed a framework for personalized graph federated learning in which distributed servers collaborate with each other and their respective clients to learn cluster-specific personalized models. The proposed framework leverages the similarities among clusters to improve learning speed and alleviate data scarcity. Further, this framework is implemented with the ADMM as a local learning process and with local zero-concentrated differential privacy to protect the participants’ data from eavesdroppers. Our mathematical analysis showed that this algorithm converges to the exact optimal solution for each cluster in linear time and that utilizing inter-cluster learning leads to an alternative output whose distance to the original solution is bounded by a value that can be adjusted with the inter-cluster learning parameter sequence. Finally, numerical simulations showed that the proposed method is capable of leveraging the graph federated architecture and the similarity between the clusters learning tasks to improve learning performance.</p>
