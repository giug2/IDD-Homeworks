<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the different losses caused by various photovoltaic (PV) array faults, accurate diagnosis of fault types is becoming increasingly important.
Compared with a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but their data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of interest.
Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a collaborative fault diagnosis model.
However, the modeling efficiency is seriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a different computing capability and amount of data.
Moreover, for the safe and stable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling must be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server.
To address these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning (ADFL) framework is proposed.
Each PV station not only trains its local model but also participates in collaborative fault diagnosis by exchanging model parameters to improve the generalization without losing accuracy.
The global model is aggregated distributedly to avoid central node failure.
By designing the asynchronous update scheme, the communication overhead and training time are greatly reduced.
Both the experiments and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The large consumption of fossil fuels has caused serious issues, such as energy shortages, environmental pollution, and global warming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As a renewable and sustainable energy source, solar energy is attracting more and more attention, where photovoltaics is one of the primary ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The photovoltaic (PV) arrays are the most fundamental part of the PV system and are prone to suffer from various faults due to the harsh outdoor environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Since these faults have different levels of harm to the PV system, it is of great significance to accurately diagnose the types of faults, thereby reducing the economic loss of power generation and avoiding safety accidents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the last decades, many studies focused on PV fault diagnosis have been carried out.
The existing methods can be mainly categorized into three types: sensing-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, electrical characteristics-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and machine learning-based (ML) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The sensing-based methods and electrical characteristics-based methods rely on manual fault feature extraction and some key parameters need to be determined through specific experiments according to the topology, which reduces the generalization of models and is not suitable for increasingly complex PV stations.
Compared with them, the ML-based methods are data-driven and automatically extract fault features through a large number of samples, which has occupied a dominant position in the field of fault diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the existing ML-based methods developed fault diagnosis models based on a single PV station without considering the case that both the types and number of fault samples are insufficient. They either assumed that the collected fault samples were sufficient and improved the accuracy of fault diagnosis through advanced neural networks, or assumed that the number of fault samples was insufficient but already contained all types of faults to be diagnosed.
Although these methods are practically important and achieve high accuracy, it is equally significant to study scenarios involving multiple PV stations to collaboratively train a shared fault diagnosis model, which is considered an important way to break data island <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
In fact, it is difficult for a single PV station to collect samples of all fault types, and there is an unbalanced distribution of samples from multiple PV stations.
If these samples can be fully utilized together, the generalization of the model can be significantly improved without losing accuracy.
Thus, it is important to design a new ML framework to make multiple PV stations learn the fault features contained in the local data from each other.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To design a new collaborative fault diagnosis framework for multiple PV stations, the following three challenges need to be addressed: data island, framework robustness, and modeling efficiency.
First, the collected samples contain the privacy information of the PV system. Since multiple PV stations belong to different operators, they are not allowed to share the original data directly. A privacy-preserving data interaction framework should be adopted.
Second, the validity and accuracy of the fault diagnosis model are essential to the safe and stable operation of the PV system. The robustness of the collaborative fault diagnosis modeling must be guaranteed.
Third, the modeling efficiency is seriously affected by model update strategy due to different amounts of data and computing capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Hence it is important to design a novel global model aggregation scheme to reduce the communication overhead and training time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) method that combines the decentralized (serverless) framework and asynchronous update strategy for PV fault diagnosis.
The problem of the unbalanced distribution of fault samples and data island among multiple PV stations is addressed through collaborative fault diagnosis while ensuring data privacy, as well as the framework robustness and modeling efficiency issues.
The proposed method fully utilizes the data of multiple PV stations to improve the generalization of the model without losing accuracy and is suitable for various meteorological conditions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, ML technology has been widely used in PV fault diagnosis, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, support vector machines (SVM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and extreme learning machine (ELM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, etc.
However, these methods rely on a large amount of labeled PV data, which is usually difficult or expensive to obtain.
Aiming at the problem of insufficient fault samples,
Feng <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> integrated domain knowledge into the learning process and proposed a domain-knowledge-based deep-broad learning framework (DK-DBLF) to reduce demand for labeled samples and improve the model flexibility.
Zhao <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a graph-based semi-supervised learning model, which only used a few labeled training data to detect line-line faults and open-circuit faults in PV arrays.
Lu <em id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN) to convert normal data from the target domain into virtual fault data by employing domain adaptation.
However, the conventional ML methods mentioned above do not consider the case that both the types and number of fault samples are insufficient. They are mostly based on the assumption that samples of all fault types to be diagnosed have been included in the labeled dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It is suitable for scenarios where the distribution of fault samples of multiple PV stations is unbalanced and they cannot share the original data directly due to privacy.
Specifically, as illustrated by Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, participants in FL only share model parameters without providing their original data.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After that, a shared global model is obtained by aggregating the model parameters of all participants, which has excellent accuracy and generalization.
The concept of FL was introduced by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and has been used in several fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Y. Liu <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed an FL-based gated recurrent unit neural network for traffic flow prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Y.

However, the methods mentioned above either used centralized FL or updated the global model synchronously.
Once the central server crashes, the collaborative modeling cannot be carried out.
In addition, since the difference in computing capability and amount of data is not considered, long waiting time for synchronous update mechanism results in low modeling efficiency.</p>

The model receiving termination threshold is introduced as a flag to update the global model.
Each agent checks the current model receiving queue after updating its local model. Once the termination threshold is triggered, it only sends model parameters to the agents in the queue to complete the global model update. Meanwhile, it sends skip signals to the remaining agents and clears the queue, indicating that they skip the current round of model aggregation. The data volume of the skip signal is very small and is not considered to consume communication resources.
Furthermore, an optimal model selection mechanism is executed to compare the latest global model with the current local model. The model with higher fault diagnosis accuracy is retained for the next round of communication.</p>

The synchronous update scheme leads to low modeling efficiency due to the long waiting time.
This motivates us to design an asynchronous strategy, where each agent joins the global model aggregation in different rounds, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.2.2 Asynchronous update strategy ‣ 3.2 ADFL Framework ‣ 3 System Model ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Since the proposed ADFL framework is decentralized, the global model is aggregated without considering the status of other agents when the model parameters collected by any agent reach a certain amount.
In the synchronous update strategy, a certain number of agents are reselected in each round to train their models, and the slowest agent greatly affects the update efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Although the number of agents participating in each round is certain due to the termination threshold, the proposed asynchronous strategy performs more efficiently.
This is because not all of these agents start to update their local models from the round in which they participate in global model aggregation.
For agents with low computing capability, it takes a long time to update their local model parameters while the global model may have been updated several times by other agents during this time.
When the local model update is completed, they will immediately participate in the global model aggregation.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.8" class="ltx_p">The original I-V curves are not directly used for fault diagnosis for two reasons.
First, there are many sampling points for the collected I-V characteristic curves, which contain redundant information and occupy additional computing resources.
Second, the sampling points on the curves are unevenly distributed, which makes it difficult to accurately reflect the fault features.
To solve these problems, the original I-V characteristic curves are compressed and enhanced by combining the down-sampling and bilinear interpolation methods.

Through the above data preprocessing method, the original curve is compressed from approximately 400 data points to 40, which are evenly distributed on the curve.
The current and voltage of the new I-V curve are expressed as a 40*2 I-V vector.
Meanwhile, considering the influence of temperature and irradiance, we add them to the I-V vector as a 40*2 environmental feature vector. Then the reconstructed 40*4 two-dimensional array is regarded as a fault sample and used as the input of the later CNN.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed ADFL framework, the global model is obtained by exchanging and aggregating local model parameters between agents.
Therefore, a neural network with the same structure is required to train a local fault diagnosis model for each agent separately.
Considering that the collected samples are 40*4 feature matrices, a plain CNN proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is selected to automatically extract the two-dimensional data features and train the local fault diagnosis model.
The structure of the CNN includes a 2-D CNN layer, 1-D CNN layers, Maxpool layers, a fully connected (FC) layer, and the Softmax function. The architecture of the network is shown in Table. <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 4.2 CNN Unit ‣ 4 ADFL for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.

Therefore, an asynchronous decentralized aggregation algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-precision collaborative (global) model by integrating their local model parameters.

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The actual PV array consists of two parallel-connected PV strings with twenty-two PV modules in series.
The I-V tester (Model: PROVA1011) equipped with an environmental tester with Bluetooth communication function is selected to collect data in various situations, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.1 Experiments Configuration ‣ 5 Experiments and Simulation Studies ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
Based on the actual PV array, short-circuit faults, partial shading faults, and degradation faults are simulated respectively. Specifically, the short-circuit faults are realized by connecting the two panels directly with wires, the partial shading faults are implemented by covering part of the PV panels with umbrellas, and the degradation faults are simulated by connecting a high-power resistor of 8 ohms in series to the PV array, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.1 Experiments Configuration ‣ 5 Experiments and Simulation Studies ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
The I-V characteristic curves and corresponding temperature and irradiance of normal and three fault states are collected under different weather conditions.
For each state, 100 pieces of data are collected and reconstructed into 40*4 two-dimensional matrices as diagnostic samples through the data preprocessing method described above.</p>

In each experiment, we set the local data of different agents to contain different types of fault samples. Specifically, if the local data of an agent contains a certain type, the number of samples is 100. Otherwise, it is 0. Taking agent 1 as an example, the first row below the normal column, i.e. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100</span>, indicates that the sample numbers in the normal state of agent 1 are 100 in all six experiments. These samples are further divided into the training set and test set by 7:3 as described in Section 5.1.
To ensure the validity of the accuracy comparison, centralized FL and centralized training use the same dataset of the above six experiments as ADFL. It is worth noting that only centralized training can share data. At this time, the training sets of the three agents are combined to train the model in each experiment.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be observed that the proposed method converges to 99% accuracy after a certain round of aggregation, which is almost the same as the centralized training method.
Taking agent 2 as an example, the global accuracy in the first five groups of experiments is improved by about 33%, 28%, 43%, 38%, and 23% respectively.
This is mainly because the proposed ADFL method enables the collaborative model to learn the fault features in the local data of all agents while ensuring data privacy.
In addition, compared with the traditional centralized FL, the proposed method achieves convergence with fewer aggregation rounds.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main factors affecting communication overhead include the number of parameters transmission in each round of global model aggregation and the number of rounds required for model convergence.
In general, the greater the local sample difference between agents, the more aggregation rounds required for the global model to converge.
In this paper, the communication overhead is set as the total number of parameters transmission when the global model converges.
The communication overhead is compared with that of centralized FL under six groups of experiments, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 5.2.3 Communication and Training Efficiency ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments and Simulation Studies ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> (a).
Obviously, the proposed method significantly reduces the communication overhead in the process of model aggregation, especially when the local data of agents is greatly heterogeneous.
For example, the communication overhead is reduced by approximately 60%, 67%, and 51% in experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3.
Even if the fault samples of agents are similar, this method still saves more than 16% of the transmission costs, such as experiment 6.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the above results have shown that the proposed method converges faster to high accuracy and reduces the communication overhead, this may not necessarily reduce the time of collaborative fault diagnosis modeling, because the time consumed in each round is also a key factor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
Especially for power systems, the speed of data processing is particularly important <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
To further evaluate the training efficiency of the proposed framework, the training time required for global model convergence in six groups of experiments is recorded separately and compared with that of centralized FL, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 5.2.3 Communication and Training Efficiency ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments and Simulation Studies ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> (b).
In each round of local updates, the epochs of local model training are set to 50 for agents. It can be seen that the proposed method greatly reduces the model training time, especially when the samples vary greatly between agents.
For example, the training time is reduced by approximately 65% in experiment 2.</p>

Experiment 1 represents the first case, where the local data of each agent contains normal data and a kind of fault data, as shown in Fig. 15(a). Moreover, the fault type of each agent is different, which has the strongest data heterogeneity.
Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent the second case, where the local dataset of each agent contains normal data and a part of fault data, as shown in Fig. 15(b)(c)(d)(e). The fault types of various agents overlap to a certain extent, which reduces the heterogeneity of data. Experiment 6 represents the third case, where the local data of each agent contains normal data and all three types of fault data, as shown in Fig. 15(f).
At this time, the fault types of each agent are the same, which conforms to independent and identical distribution (IID), and the data heterogeneity is the lowest.
To avoid accidental errors, the result of each experiment is the average accuracy of 20 times, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ 5.3.1 Accuracy of The Global Model with ADFL ‣ 5.3 Numerical Simulation Results ‣ 5 Experiments and Simulation Studies ‣ Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>.</p>

For the second case, the proposed method still converges slightly faster than centralized FL under various data heterogeneity situations. For the third case, the convergence speed of the proposed method is almost the same as that of the centralized FL due to low data heterogeneity and few rounds required for convergence.
In all cases, the proposed method can achieve 99% accuracy after certain aggregation rounds.
In fact, there is significant data heterogeneity among actual PV stations due to differences in geographic environment and operating conditions, and the proposed method is more suitable to be adopted.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning framework is proposed for PV fault diagnosis.
The data island problem among multiple PV stations is addressed through collaborative fault diagnosis, which enhances the generalization of the model without losing accuracy.
Different from centralized learning, each PV station trains its local model and only shares model parameters rather than original data to ensure privacy.
Considering the framework robustness and training efficiency, the global model is aggregated distributedly to avoid central node failure.
By designing the asynchronous update strategy, the communication overhead and training time are greatly reduced.
Both experimental and numerical simulation results show that the global model obtained by the proposed method successfully diagnoses the types of faults contained in the data of all participants, and reaches the accuracy of centralized training.
The performance of the proposed method in convergence speed, communication overhead, and training time is better than centralized federated learning.</p>
