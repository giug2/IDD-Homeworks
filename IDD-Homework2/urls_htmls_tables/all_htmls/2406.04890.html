<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">Forecasting indoor temperatures is of paramount importance to achieve efficient control of HVAC systems. In this task, the limited data availability presents a challenge as most of the available data is acquired during standard operation where extreme scenarios and transitory regimes such as major temperature increases or decreases are <span id="id15.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">de-facto</span> excluded. Acquisition of such data requires significant energy consumption and a dedicated facility, hindering the quantity and diversity of available data. To acquire such data, we make use of such a facility referred to as the Test-cell. Cost related constraints however do not allow for continuous year-around acquisition.
To address this, we investigate the efficacy of data augmentation techniques, particularly leveraging state-of-the-art AI-based methods for synthetic data generation. Inspired by practical and experimental motivations, we explore fusion strategies of real and synthetic data to improve forecasting models. This approach alleviates the need for continuously acquiring extensive time series data, especially in contexts involving repetitive heating and cooling cycles in buildings.
Our evaluation methodology for synthetic data synthesis involves a dual-focused approach: firstly, we assess the performance of synthetic data generators independently, particularly focusing on SoTA AI-based methods; secondly, we measure the utility of incorporating synthetically augmented data in a subsequent downstream tasks (forecasting).
In the forecasting tasks, we employ a simple model in two distinct scenarios: 1) we first examine an augmentation technique that combines real and synthetically generated data to expand the training dataset, 2) Second, we delve into utilizing synthetic data to tackle dataset imbalances.
Our results highlight the potential of synthetic data augmentation in enhancing forecasting accuracy while mitigating training variance. Through empirical experiments, we show significant improvements achievable by integrating synthetic data, thereby paving the way for more robust forecasting models in low-data regime.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Indoor temperature forecasting predicts future temperature values in the different rooms of a building, leveraging historical data and environmental factors for proactive Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system management and comfort optimization.
The European Union emphasizes the importance of efficient building energy management systems to achieve sustainability goals, given that buildings contribute to 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO<sub id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> emissions in the EU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. HVAC systems, responsible for the majority of energy consumption in buildings, significantly influence both household comfort and environmental impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, heating and cooling systems in buildings are controlled by a schedule.
This type of regulation does not take into account factors such as outdoor weather, solar radiation, and changes in occupancy, and therefore can lead to excessively heating (or cooling) of a room thus creating discomfort for the occupants.
A solution that, instead, makes use of the predicted room temperature as an input, can lead to a better comfort for the occupants while achieving consistent savings in energy use.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning models have demonstrated superiority over traditional physics-based methods in indoor temperature forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Currently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, remain a practical choice for such forecasting tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Our approach differs from those aforementioned as we do not focus on finding the best forecaster. Instead, we seek to enhance forecasting as a whole, in particular in low-data environments.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The literature surveys, as evidenced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, commonly delineate modern approaches to time series data augmentation into three broad categories: traditional methods, GAN-based techniques, and Auto-Encoder-based techniques. Traditional methods such as homogeneous scaling and rotation are noted for their cost-effectiveness and simplicity. However, they often disrupt temporal relationships within the time series. Consequently, contemporary approaches lean towards generative models to better preserve temporal dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> discusses 23 methods, including 9 Variational Auto-Encoder based (VAE) and 14 GAN-based techniques. Despite the widespread use of GANs, they are prone to convergence issues, particularly in low-data contexts, although they yield more diverse data. The over representation of GANs in the generic synthetic generation literature is furthermore confirmed by the reports from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

It incorporates serveral strategies to enhance efficiency:
firstly, it employs both an adversarial loss and a supervised loss, combining the control provided by supervised learning with the flexibility inherent in unsupervised GAN models.
Additionally, TimeGAN utilizes a dimension reduction technique involving embedding and recovery networks. These networks map features to latent representations, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the time series data. This approach capitalizes on the fact that the temporal dynamics of time series data can often be captured in a lower-dimensional space relative to the length of the series, thereby simplifying the tasks performed by the GAN.
Furthermore, the generator and discriminator operate within the latent space. TimeGAN adopts a joint training approach for the embedding and the generative network. This strategy facilitates the learning of temporal relationships by the generator.</p>

</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address fidelity concerns, DoppleGANger introduces an auxiliary discriminator dedicated to metadata generation ; although this aspect is not utilized in the context of this article. To mitigate mode collapse, it implements a strategy that constrains generation to randomized min-max values at each iteration, which are later scaled back to realistic ranges. This technique ensures diversity in generated samples and effectively combats mode collapse.
Moreover, DoppleGANger modifies the canonical GAN framework by integrating LSTM cells to better capture temporal dependencies. To mitigate memory loss associated with RNN cells, DoppleGANger introduces the concept of <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">batched generation</span>, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple records at each cell pass instead of the traditional single-step generation approach.

<p id="S4.I9.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">MASE provides a standardized measure of forecast accuracy by comparing a model’s performance to that of a naïve forecast. Its calculation involves the mean of the absolute errors divided by the mean absolute error of a naïve forecast. MASE is scale independent, symmetric with respect to over and under predictions, but depends on a naive forecaster and is thus different for every dataset encountered.</p>

Concerning the DoppleGANger model (first row), it demonstrates an ability to capture the general trend from the training set, but introduces a high frequency parasite component, which resembles samples with high noise to signal ratio (see for example, samples 201 and 254).
Lastly, TimeVQVAE appears to show some more diversity than its counterpart, and is free of the noisy artifacts present in DoppleGANger.</p>

Interestingly, our analysis reveals no significant discernible improvement or deterioration in performance, as evidenced by the overlapping likelihood distributions of both the baseline and the augmented scenarios. However, regarding variance, our observations vary depending on the metric utilized and the ratio, with fluctuations ranging from a minor 0.14% decrease to a more substantial 55% increase. We hypothesise that such an increase might be caused by the nature of the datasets which remain strictly identical in all the baseline runs but is unique to each test run.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments highlight the superior performance of a VQVAE-based model compared to some state-of-the-art GAN models for synthesising uni-variate time series in low data environments. Additionally, we discover that in relatively simple datasets, augmenting the dataset with synthetic samples can lead to enhanced forecasting accuracy in subsequent tasks particularly in cases of data scarcity, albeit the expanse of training variance. This latter problem requires further investigation as explained in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="V-C Experimental study 2: Class balancing ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Enhancing Indoor Temperature Forecasting through Synthetic Data in Low-Data Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-C</span></span></a>. We also find out that using synthesizers to balance out class distribution neither particularly increases or decreases overall performance. However, it’s worth noting the imbalance present in our testing set, which might affect the results. Further investigation and experiments are required on the test set to better understand this behaviour. Notably, we deem necessary to run similar experiments on time series datasets from other domains to ensure validity of our conclusions.</p>
