<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">The absence of robust security protocols renders the VANET (Vehicle ad-hoc Networks) network open to cyber threats by compromising passengers and road safety. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely employed to detect network security threats. With vehicles’ high mobility on the road and diverse environments, VANETs devise ever-changing network topologies, lack privacy and security, and have limited bandwidth efficiency. The absence of privacy precautions, End-to-End Encryption methods, and Local Data Processing systems in VANET also present many privacy and security difficulties. So, assessing whether a novel real-time processing IDS approach can be utilized for this emerging technology is crucial. The present study introduces a novel approach for intrusion detection by the capabilities of Federated Learning (FL) in conjunction with the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sequence classification (FL-BERT). The significance of data privacy is duly recognized. According to FL methodology, each client has its own local model and dataset. They train their models locally and then send the model’s weights (or parameters) to the server. After aggregation, the server aggregates the weights from all clients to update a global model. After aggregation, the global model’s weights are shared with the clients. This practice guarantees the secure storage of sensitive raw data on individual clients’ devices, effectively protecting privacy. After conducting the federated learning procedure, we assessed our models’ performance using a separate test dataset.
The FL-BERT technique has yielded promising results, opening avenues for further investigation in this particular area of research. Also examined were several conventional machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to detect threats. However, these models lack data privacy. We used the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) benchmark dataset in both cases. We reached the result of our approaches by comparing existing research works and found that FL-BERT is more effective for privacy and security concerns. Overall, our results suggest that FL-BERT is a promising technique for enhancing attack detection effectiveness, whereas the FL-BERT approach performs satisfactorily in attack detection and safeguarding data.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vehicle ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) constitute a specialized subset of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), characterized by their dynamic topology due to high node mobility. The integration of wireless communication and computing technology in contemporary vehicles has propelled research, standardization, and development efforts towards enhancing inter-vehicle communication. This evolution is pivotal for the future of automobiles and road traffic systems, emphasizing reliance on wireless networks and machine learning to bolster road safety and mitigate highway fatalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental premise of VANETs lies in enabling vehicles to engage in intelligent communication, facilitating the exchange of critical information regarding road conditions and potential diversions. IEEE 802.11p serves as a communication standard in VANETs, providing a framework for vehicles to share crucial information. The architecture of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based VANETs, as proposed by Ku et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, recognizes and addresses challenges arising from frequent disconnections, dynamic topology, and substantial node mobility within these networks. However, the heightened dynamism of VANET mobility surpasses that of MANETs, necessitating a robust mechanism to manage security vulnerabilities that could jeopardize the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept into VANETs has garnered increasing attention, particularly in implementing learning-based intrusion detection mechanisms. Despite making strides, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in VANETs are nascent, confronting various challenges and obstacles that warrant thorough investigation. This work identifies key elements and activities requiring attention from the research community.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The literature review illuminates notable gaps in learning-based IDS research, signalling opportunities for refining IDS model accuracy while addressing data privacy and security concerns. Despite advancements, users of IDS systems continue to grapple with detecting known unencrypted attacks, with achieving 100% accuracy remaining an elusive goal. The challenges posed by false positives and negatives underscore the imperative for optimization in IDS to mitigate these issues effectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of VANETs and IDS, concerns about adversarial attacks on machine learning models are prominent, whereby the deliberate injection of erroneous or malicious data may compromise the functionality of these models. Additionally, the absence of a publicly available VANET database with recorded attacks hampers progress, and the quest for a fast, cost-effective, and efficient privacy-preserving machine learning-based IDS remains an ongoing pursuit.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The communication requirements of VANETs focused on data transmission between vehicles, raise pertinent privacy concerns as sensitive information may be vulnerable. Striking a delicate balance between the imperative for continuous data exchange and preserving user privacy becomes paramount. The perpetual transmission of position data introduces privacy challenges, with the potential to misuse information about an individual’s daily travel patterns. Developing an IDS system that ensures continuous monitoring with high attack detection accuracy while preventing unauthorized access or unintended data utilization presents a formidable challenge for researchers.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Exploring VANETs and IDS reveals a nuanced landscape with avenues for refinement in intrusion detection accuracy, privacy preservation, and overall system robustness. Ongoing research endeavors are indispensable for addressing these challenges and propelling the development of secure and efficient VANETs in the dynamic domain of smart transportation systems.</p>

<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we describe the selected datasets and attacks, as well as the implementation of our proposed FL-BERT model alongside conventional models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). All of these are intended to improve the detection of anomalies in Software-defined VANET architecture. In addition, the FL-BERT data privacy mechanisms inherent to this architecture are discussed.</p>

<p id="Sx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The VeReMi dataset was created to test the effectiveness of VANET misbehavior detection systems (vehicular networks).

<p id="Sx3.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are algorithms used in learning for classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks. They are particularly effective in situations with data and can handle cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. SVMs use a subset of training data called support vectors, which helps improve memory efficiency. One advantage of SVMs is their versatility; they can utilize kernel functions, including ones you can define yourself. However, there are some limitations to consider. Overfitting may occur if the number of features greatly exceeds the number of samples. Careful choices must be made regarding kernel selection and regularization techniques to address this issue. Additionally, SVMs do not provide probability estimates by default; obtaining these requires performing five-fold cross-validation. In the scikit learn library, SVMs can handle both sparse vectors; however, when making predictions on data, it is important first to fit the model on similar data. The decision function for an SVM is expressed as: <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite></p>

Its ”lazy” nature limits its use in huge-scale programs like dynamic internet mining. To decorate efficiency, consultant statistics factors can be used to symbolize the whole schooling set, basically developing an inductive studying model. While numerous algorithms like selection trees and neural networks serve this cause, kNN’s simplicity and effectiveness, especially obvious in textual content categorization obligations like the Reuters corpus, encourage efforts to optimize its performance without compromising accuracy. During model production, each information factor possesses a maximal local neighbourhood with statistics points of the same elegance label. The largest of these neighbourhoods, termed the ”largest global neighbourhood,” acts as a representative. This method repeats till all statistics points are represented. Unlike traditional kNN, this approach would not require a predefined ( k ); it is routinely decided through model production. Using representatives no longer simply reduces records but additionally boosts performance, addressing kNN’s inherent barriers.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The model being discussed in this paper is a practical application of federated learning, specifically utilising the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. This model has been specifically tailored for use with the VeReMi dataset. Federated learning is an approach in machine learning where the training process is distributed over several devices or servers, referred to as clients, without the need to share the raw data. This approach guarantees the confidentiality of records, as the most efficient iterations of changes are transmitted to a central server, consolidating these updates to enhance a global model.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data preparation plays a key role in the pipeline of every machine learning system. In the present model, a combination of various columns extracted from the dataset is performed, including ’sendtime’, ’sender’, ’messageID’, ’pos’, ’spd’, ’sendtime’, and ’sender’, resulting in the creation of a unified column referred to as ’textual content’. This compiled text serves as the input for the BERT model. The column labeled ’AttackerType’, potentially containing explicit data indicating unique categories of attackers, is subsequently encoded using label encoding to convert it into a numerical format. The column labelled ”labels” in this encoding acts as the dependent variable for the model. The data is subsequently divided into educational and testing components, with 80% of the data allocated for educational purposes and the remaining 20% set aside for testing.</p>

The utilization of the BERT tokenizer, namely the ”bert-base-uncased” paradigm, serves the intended objective. To facilitate the tokenization process and prepare the records for training, a class called ‘CustomDataset‘ has been implemented. The brilliance of this approach lies in its utilization of texts, related labels, a tokenizer, and a maximum sequence time as input parameters.</p>

Every buyer corresponds to a device or server with a fraction of the training data. The user initiates a BERT model for classifying collections, transfers it to the designated computing device (GPU or CPU), and specifies an optimizer for the training process. The global model (the model aggregating updates from all local models) is continuously reset and transmitted to all clients. This means that the global model does not excessively rely on data from any specific user, which could potentially disclose patterns specific to that user. By continuously resetting the global model, it is harder for an attacker to infer specific patterns from the actions of the model, as a result enhancing privacy.</p>

<p id="Sx4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated an accuracy rate of 49%, indicating competence in certain categories while exhibiting deficiencies in others. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression models demonstrated a comparable accuracy rate of 59%. Although these models showed proficiency in identifying certain types of attackers, their performance was comparatively poorer in other areas. This discrepancy suggests the possibility of overfitting or insufficiency in effectively addressing the intricate nature of the dataset.</p>

<div id="Sx4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The KNN model had a lower accuracy rate of 38%, indicating that it may not be well-suited for the given data distribution or the intrinsic difficulties of the VANET system.
In summary, while standard machine learning models have demonstrated varying levels of efficacy, FL BERT has emerged as a viable choice for detecting abnormalities in Software-Defined VANETs. In handling various types of assailants, this model exhibits superior accuracy and precision compared to its counterparts. This study highlights the potential of utilizing advanced neural network models to address complex cybersecurity concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In intrusion detection, the FL-BERT model exhibits a high degree of precision and recall for Attack type 1 (Constant Attack) and Attack type 2 (Constant Offset Attack), with F1-scores of 0.95 and 1.00, respectively. This suggests that the model is highly effective at identifying and correctly classifying these types of attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For Attack type 4 (Random Attack), the model shows a relatively lower precision of 0.65 but a high recall of 0.88, resulting in an F1-score of 0.75. This indicates that while the model correctly identifies a high proportion of this attack type (high recall), it also incorrectly classifies other types as this attack (lower precision).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The model’s performance on Attack type 8 (Random Offset Attack) and Attack type 16 (Eventual stop Attack) is mixed, with F1-scores of 0.55 and 0.86 respectively. The lower F1-score for Attack type 8 suggests that this type of attack is more challenging for the model to identify and classify correctly.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, with its federated learning approach, the FL-BERT model demonstrates a promising capability in intrusion detection tasks, particularly in classifying different types of attacks. However, the varying performance across attack types suggests potential areas for further optimization and improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p9.1" class="ltx_p">FL-BERT’s advantages and disadvantages are similarly highlighted by evaluating using standard methods like Random Forest and SVM. Compared to FL-BERT, the much-reduced precision and do-not-forget values in these typical designs highlight how complicated the information is. Without the benefit of deep architectures, such models might not be able to grasp the subtle styles in VANET records, leading to more frequent misclassifications.</p>

<p id="Sx4.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The imbalance of the records is a further important consideration. The training data structure is crucial in determining how a model makes predictions. The model’s knowledge may be skewed if certain assault types predominate in the dataset, making it either too aggressive or cautious. For instance, an excess of benign statistics may make the version prone to making warning errors, leading to the classification of capability risks as unimportant. In conclusion, although FL-BERT claims outstanding accuracy, understanding these nuances and continuously improving the version based only on these insights are crucial to minimizing misclassifications.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">FL-BERT Privacy Concern</h2>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Implementing FL-BERT in a Software-defined Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) demonstrates the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with the intricate realm of vehicular communications. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are specifically engineered to introduce a novel era of intelligent transportation systems, wherein vehicles establish communication to ensure safety and optimize traffic flow. Nevertheless, the nature of statistics transmitted across these networks is sensitive. The continual sharing of information regarding every vehicle’s role, speed, route, and other factors raises privacy concerns, highlighting its importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Introducing FL-BERT, a customized iteration of the esteemed BERT model designed for federated learning. Federated Learning (FL) is a notable technology that enables models to acquire knowledge from several devices or servers without the requirement of centralizing data. The primary advantage of employing this technique lies in its ability to provide strict localization of raw recordings, which can be highly illuminating within the context of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). Instead of transmitting raw data, only updated model versions, such as gradients or weights, are returned to a central server. This implies that intricate details regarding specific vehicles, their routes, or communication patterns are never disclosed to any significant entity or possible individuals attempting to intercept such information.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Preserving anonymity is more appropriate when a central server collects updates from multiple clients to enhance the global model. The process of aggregating automatically provides a level of anonymization. By amalgamating updates from multiple sources, the task of reverse engineering or deducing specific details about an individual information source or user will become exceedingly challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The periodic re-initialization of the version represents a widely implemented yet significant measure to enhance privacy. The gadget employs regularly resetting and disseminating the global version to all clients, preventing overfitting and excessive reliance on data from any specific user. The aforementioned behavior is a deterrent for potential attackers who may attempt to infer specific patterns from the actions of the version in question.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The significance of BERT, characterized by its transformer architecture, is equally crucial. Transformers exhibit a high level of proficiency in processing sequential data and have the capability to capture intricate patterns. In the context of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), this implies that the proposed model can effectively process vehicular data streams without the need for explicit feature engineering. This enhances the model’s accuracy and mitigates the potential risk of information leakage occasionally occurring with manually designed routines.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, it is important to note that no technology is completely impervious to vulnerabilities. Despite implementing federated studying, the persistence of vulnerabilities, like version inversion attacks, remains a concern. These attacks include malicious entities attempting to reconstruct raw information from version updates. To enhance the security measures of the gadget, incorporating additional techniques, such as differential privacy, would prove advantageous.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Using FL-BERT in VANETs is a significant step towards a future in which vehicular networks are more intelligent and prioritize each participant’s privacy. The results, which highlight the superior performance of FL-BERT compared to conventional models such as Random Forest and SVM, also underscore the potential of federated learning in these significant applications.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The need for robust security and privacy solutions is increasingly emphasized in the dynamic landscape of Software-defined Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). This study has made significant contributions in shedding light on a promising path forward, offering contemporary solutions that effectively negotiate the complex interplay between advanced machine learning and data privacy. The emergence of FL-BERT, a framework that combines Federated Learning with the BERT model, exemplifies the revolutionary potential of integrating decentralized learning with advanced text categorization algorithms.

FL-BERT consistently demonstrates impressive performance metrics, outperforming its more conventional counterparts, despite its intricate structure that prioritizes data privacy. The aforementioned findings demonstrate a significant shift in paradigms, implying that the future of secure VANETs may rely on using federated learning frameworks that exploit advanced device learning architectures.</p>
