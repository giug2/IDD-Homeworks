<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-enhancing technology for distributed ML. By training models locally and aggregating updates - a federation learns together, while bypassing centralised data collection. FL is increasingly popular in healthcare, finance and personal computing. However, it inherits fairness challenges from classical ML and introduces new ones, resulting from differences in data quality, client participation, communication constraints, aggregation methods and underlying hardware. Fairness remains an unresolved issue in FL and the community has identified an absence of succinct definitions and metrics to quantify fairness; to address this, we propose <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Fairness Analytics</em> - a methodology for measuring fairness. Our definition of fairness comprises four notions with novel, corresponding metrics. They are symptomatically defined and leverage techniques originating from XAI, cooperative game-theory and networking engineering. We tested a range of experimental settings, varying the FL approach, ML task and data settings. The results show that statistical heterogeneity and client participation affect fairness and fairness conscious approaches such as Ditto and q-FedAvg marginally improve fairness-performance trade-offs. Using our techniques, FL practitioners can uncover previously unobtainable insights into their system’s fairness, at differing levels of granularity in order to address fairness challenges in FL. We have open-sourced our work at: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oscardilley/federated-fairness" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/oscardilley/federated-fairness</a>.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data is naturally distributed around us, commonly made inert by data protection regulations. Classically, to train machine learning models, data is collected centrally – the data is brought to the model. However, such scenarios where data and compute power can be centralised are not archetypal of most of the world around us – where data and processing infrastructure naturally exist in distributed pockets. This segmentation of data can be observed in many areas of modern life and it is common that the data is immovable between segments due to legislative rules. For example, corporations with data centres spread globally may be prevented from cross-border sharing due to regulation. Alternatively, in the UK’s NHS, which consists of thousands of individual practices, patient information is stored on different systems which are not typically interconnected<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Segmentation also arises at in personal computing where users are not willing to share their personal data with third parties. These examples only scratch the surface of the possible distributed data scenarios and motivates the idea that many parties could benefit from the application of machine learning and privacy-preserving knowledge-sharing across the different segments, instead of taking the data to the model. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning was proposed in the seminal paper by B. McMahan from Google in 2017<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. It presents the original approach for FL, FedAvg, and offers a privacy-preserving solution to the problem above, whilst being competitive in performance with its centralised counterparts in a set of typical machine learning tasks. Since its inception, FL has been deployed into a wide range of applications with cross-device implementations such as with Google’s GBoard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>; it is also rumoured, to be used in detecting the wake-up phrase, ‘Hey Siri’ for Apple’s voice agent<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The effectiveness of cross-silo scenarios have also been demonstrated, such as in a case where a small number of UK hospitals collected data and trained a model using FL to screen for Covid-19<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent, general-FL literature, fairness is repeatedly recognised as one of the key open problems. A 2021 review by P. Kairouz and B. McMahan of Google, designates a section to identifying fairness as a key area for future research in FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Other general surveys, from 2022 and 2023, also draw attention to the potential for heterogeneity to lead to unfairness, motivating further research<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Finally, in a talk at the 2024 Flower AI Summit, the Head of Samsung AI Europe, refers to the difficulty managing bias and fairness in FL as “a completely unsolved problem, even in central learning”<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For commercial viability of machine learning solutions, compliance with local data protection regulations such as GDPR is essential. As fairness is a core principle of GDPR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, regulation abidance and fairness handling are inherently intertwined. This is threatened by the ’black-box’ nature of many machine learning systems, where outputs are rarely transparent or justified - addressing fairness and explainability are therefore crucial for delivering industry-ready FL solutions. Fairness concerns can arise in scenarios where there are differences between client’s, behaviour, treatment, data or any other characteristic in a system. A thorough definition of fairness in FL is provided later - for now, it can be considered philosophically as equal treatment for all involved. Difference is natural in real-world systems and its effects must be anticipated to appear in many ways; we adopted the definitions of Ye et al. which suggest four flavours of heterogeneity that can impact a system - statistical, model, communication or device centric<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several fairness-specific surveys, published in 2023, offer a general picture of the latest work in the field of FL fairness and evidence the demand for research into how such fairness can be effectively defined and quantified. Each motivates the requirements for fairness, proposes its own set of definitions and discusses the existing frameworks which have been proposed to improve fairness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Evidencing scenarios that would benefit from fairer FL frameworks is a strength of the existing literature. For example, FL could be used to process images with the aim of detecting skin cancer, via training a classifier model over a set of globally distributed clients. Clients could range from individuals with single-image datasets, to large hospitals. It is suggested that unfairness may arise if clients achieve different levels of classification accuracy, if the model behaves favourably or unfavourably towards samples with specific characteristics – such as skin colour - or if the system exhibits bias towards certain client’s hardware or network capabilities<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Shi et al. go further, suggesting that it is important for the contribution of the client to be considered in attribution of fairness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The free-rider problem (also discussed by Rafi et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) can emerge if a client does not usefully contribute to the training of the model, but still benefits from the work of other clients when it receives updated global models. This is not a complete description of all the flavours of unfairness that can arise but it demonstrates that fairness in FL is a multi-faceted problem and that mitigation is crucial for real-world systems. It should also be noted, that there is typically a trade-off that must be considered between communication efficiency, privacy, accuracy and fairness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This work highlights the limitations of the current literature in defining fairness in FL and hence proposes Federated Fairness Analytics, a methodology for quantifying fairness in FL systems. With our modular notions, the fairness performance of existing systems can be evaluated in a repeatable, human-interpretable way – enabling transparency, comparison of different approaches and directed development to improve systems. Quantifying and explaining unfairness is a key, first step towards ensuring future deployments are fair and towards explainable-artificial-intelligence (XAI) in FL. The aim in this work is not to improve fairness, but to offer a platform to interpret and identify unfairness, this entailed:</p>

<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When defining a system, it is typical in FL to use the terms, cross-device, and cross-silo to differentiate between data settings<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Once a FL approach is realised, evaluation metrics are used to measure the performance of the models in the federation. Evaluation is challenging due to the private nature of the distributed data. Federated evaluation is used in this paper, whereby each client retains a proportion of its samples to construct a personal test-set for evaluation - the clients each inform the server of their individual performance. This is in contrast to centralised evaluation where the server evaluates the model using a test-set at the server (obtaining a representative dataset would involve violating client data privacy). The term, federated analytics, generalises federated evaluation for any metric<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Analytics, such as those presented enable server-side insights into the behaviour, performance and in this case, fairness of the clients in a federation. To achieve this, the server instructs the clients to perform certain calculations on their data, in rounds where they are selected, and the clients return the results to the server. Typically, only basic metrics are collected, limiting the explainability and transparency of existing systems.

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The matter of fairness is a well-established, albeit unsolved problem in centralised machine learning scenarios, where a single model is trained on a single dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Given FL systems are defined by the interconnection of a number of smaller centralised systems, some traditional definitions are still relevant to federated settings, enabling comparison of some aspects of fairness between clients. These include some field wide definitions, such as <em id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">’fairness through awareness"</em> (whereby the model should be expected to behave similarly for similar inputs) and those under the umbrella of <em id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">’group fairness’</em> which seek to protect sensitive groups from bias by ensuring types of statistical parity across groups. Despite having some similarities, FL demands its own set of definitions of fairness to encapsulate its additional complexity.

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing research offering approaches for fair-FL define fairness narrowly, as such, the more general definitions from the recent, fairness-specific, survey papers are considered as a starting point. These break fairness into a number of notions either describing symptomatic conditions that would indicate unfairness or causal mechanisms that would lead to fairness. Symptom-based definition is favourable as notions are measurable without knowledge of the system’s design and do not mandate the use of any specific techniques to achieve fairness. The definition from Shi et al. is limited as it is built on a combination of mechanisms and symptoms of unfairness which have many co-dependencies and overlaps, limiting intuitiveness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Rafi et al. have a purely mechanism based definition<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The definition offered by Vucinich et al. is symptom based, meaning it is able to encompass a wide variety of specific sources of unfairness in three easily understood and observable types<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The approach is however limited, as although it considers parity in the local objective of the client’s, it fails to consider the potential unfairness if the clients fail to also solve the global objective function for the orchestrator - which is the aim of the federation, as measured by either centralised or federated evaluation. This is particularly relevant in cross-device settings where the server aims to train a model using hundreds or thousands of devices to deploy to millions. The existing definitions have the following limitations, but pave the way for a more comprehensive, measurable and symptom-driven definition:</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">To measure fairness, metrics are required. Extensive research to discover metrics and definitions for fairness in centralised machine learning was necessitated by vast deployment in applications that are protected by anti-discrimination legislation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. FL must go through the same transition in order to pose as a viable alternative with distributed data. Despite the additional complexity with FL, some of the centralised metrics to detect algorithmic bias, are still insightful in the context of individual client’s performance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The most prominent metrics under the umbrella of ’group fairness’ are disparate impact and demographic parity, alongside equalised odds and equal opportunity which were designed to overcome the shortcomings of the former two metrics<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Equalised odds is a metric that measures the difference in the true positive and false positive rates between two groups, one with and one without a binary sensitive attribute. Equal opportunity is the constrained case of equalised odds which only considers the true positive rates and is therefore less robust.

A drawback of using variance based measures is the infinite range and lack of normalisation - this makes it difficult to compare approaches with different statistical characteristics. An alternative measure of uniformity is Jain’s Fairness Index (JFI)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which is commonly used to evaluate resource allocation for computer networks using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In the existing adaptations of JFI for FL, the client’s performance, is used as the independent variable, of which the uniformity is to be measured. The UCB-BS approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, uses JFI to measure fairness and can be adapted for personalised models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p5.10" class="ltx_p">Contribution-aware fairness seeks proportionality not solely parity. As clients classically only transmit their model weights to the server in FL - measuring how much any client has added to the learning process is challenging. A contribution evaluation in FL is broadly described as being a technique to measure how each client contributed to the global model - this data can be used to orchestrate a fairer system in the presence of all four flavours of heterogeneity. A number of techniques, ranging from clients self reporting (vulnerable to clients reporting inaccurate results in the knowledge that there is no mechanism for server validation) to reputation mechanisms and utility-game based schemes can be used to calculate contribution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

As this is a research paper at limited scale, true FedSV values have been used for accuracy. The cited approximations and alternative approaches should be used as required. A fairness metric has also been proposed, combining Shapley values and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, but, it is limited by its sensitivity to outliers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A number of existing works propose novel approaches to address aspects of the fairness problem in FL. Most commonly, they target uniformity of the accuracy achieved by the clients in classification tasks. Approaches such as AgnosticFair<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Ditto<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, FedFA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, FedFV<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, FedMGDA+<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, PropFair<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and q-FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> all offer alternatives to FedAvg that seek greater uniformity. In these works, uniformity is attributed to fairness, however, uniformity of performance measures are ignorant of the extent to which the client has contributed to the model training. Other approaches addressing notions of individual fairness across clients whilst requiring proportionality of the performance to the contribution include FOCUS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, CFFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and the CGSV reward mechanism<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. As the reward for clients participating in FL is typically the performance gain obtained from the global model, such schemes that consider the contributions incentivise participation as well as encouraging fairness.

</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most other existing approaches focus on notions of group fairness, attempting to mitigate discrimination against protected groups in FL. FairFed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, FairFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, FMDA-M<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, FPFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, PrivFairFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> and the work using Variational AutoEncoders for FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, all appreciate the effect that heterogeneity can have on group fairness across the federation and use unique techniques to optimise group fairness. It is important to note, similarly to the fundamental assumptions of this paper, all of these approaches rely on the clients and server knowing the sensitive characteristics from the start of the training. In these existing attempts to mitigate individual or group unfairness mentioned above, each only address one facet of the fairness problem and are hence cannot claim to be entirely fair.

<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, there exist a number of approaches that attempt to address notions of both individual and group fairness. FairFB<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> is based on the centralised fair learning algorithm, FairBatch - it targets group fairness and can be modified for uniformity based individual fairness as well. FedMinMax<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> tackles group fairness as a classical minimax optimisation problem and shows that this also encourages individual fairness. GIFAIR-FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> uses a dynamic reweighing strategy to encourage uniformity across clients and groups in global and personalised settings. All of these are still limited as they are uniformity based and fail to consider the levels of client contributions. To summarise, although there are a number of existing approaches for fair FL, none attempt to either quantify or solve the full spectrum of fairness concerns.</p>

<br class="ltx_break"></span>Reward is important in FL, as an unfair incentive scheme may discourage participation - in the commercial realm, clients may join a competitor’s federation. Incentive fairness is defined as the degree of uniformity, as measured by JFI, of the reward over contribution gains of the clients. This is logical as it enables heterogeneous systems to be fair, for example, if adversarial clients with poor data are rewarded unfavourably and clients with high quality datasets are generously rewarded but both are directly proportionate to their Shapley contribution, the system’s incentive scheme will be deemed as fair. The mathematical definition is provided in Equation <a href="#Sx4.E10" title="In item 3 ‣ Proposed Techniques to Quantify Fairness ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.

<br class="ltx_break"></span>In cross-device FL in particular, the server orchestrates the learning process in order to obtain a more successful model than clients could train locally, or that the server could train due to limitations in availability of suitable data or cost. For example, when an entity such as Google wants to train for GBoard, they want to use a small proportion of a population which are available and willing to participate, to train a model that can be deployed to millions of devices. As the server has invested in the process and has facilitated the learning, this work proposes that it would be unfair if, in exchange, the server did not receive a high performing model - this motivates the introduction of orchestrator fairness. Orchestrator fairness is measured as the mean average of the normalised client performance (accuracy is already normalised if this is the metric used), <math id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\hat{x}_{n,k}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2a"><msub id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.2.cmml">x</mi><mo id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.1.cmml">^</mo></mover><mrow id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><mo id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.4.1" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml">k</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2b"><apply id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2"><ci id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.1">^</ci><ci id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.3.2.2">𝑥</ci></apply><list id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.4"><ci id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑛</ci><ci id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2.2.2.2">𝑘</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx4.I5.i4.p1.2.m1.2c">\hat{x}_{n,k}</annotation></semantics></math> as is shown in Equation <a href="#Sx4.E11" title="In item 4 ‣ Proposed Techniques to Quantify Fairness ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>.</p>

<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experimental work in this paper aims to test the metrics for fairness analytics, on a wide range of FL scenarios. Many factors could impact fairness including the model, the dataset, heterogeneity conditions, the number of clients, the client sampling rate, the values of hyperparameters or the application of privacy-enhancing techniques. This section justifies the selection of the most prominent of these for experimentation, as displayed in Table <a href="#Sx5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Experimental Design ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Figure <a href="#Sx5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Experimental Design ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the architecture of the testbed used to simulate the differing conditions and to calculate fairness during training time.</p>

<div id="Sx5.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed, a number of existing FL approaches attempt to address different aspects of fairness. The aim, is to evaluate a pair of the most promising approaches from the literature against the baseline approach, FedAvg. In order to select the most interesting benchmarks, all known approaches that primarily target fairness were qualitatively evaluated against our four notions of fairness. By analysing each publication, it was determined which of the logical definitions of fairness that the approach attempted to address (only the awareness/intent is assessed, not the success of the approach) and the key techniques used were noted. From this, the resulting frameworks in Table <a href="#Sx4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Proposed Techniques to Quantify Fairness ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> were selected as the most interesting based on their provenience (publication, academic or commercial institutions and number of citations on Google Scholar), and the range of fairness notions that they addressed. For the additional approaches - <span id="Sx5.SSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">q-FedAvg</span> is selected as it is commonly accepted as the first approach seeking fairness and appears extensively in the literature. <span id="Sx5.SSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ditto</span> is also selected for variety - testing on a personalisation based algorithm. CGSV and FedMinMax were discarded as they were not compatible with our assumptions - FedMinMax requires all clients to participate in every round of training and CGSV uses model sparsification (model adaptation is out of the scope of this paper and would reduce the comparability between benchmarks).</p>

This section displays some results from the experiments described in Table <a href="#Sx5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Experimental Design ‣ Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, in order to demonstrate important insights about the effects of the frameworks, data settings and heterogeneity on fairness, which would not be possible without this work. As the tools are designed to be a modular add-on, these results only scratch the surface of the interesting and important possible applications of these tools. Acceptable levels of fairness are subjective and application dependent, however, this work proposes that a threshold of 0.8 to constitute acceptable general fairness of a system, loosely corresponding to 80% of users achieving fairness in the JFI based metrics.</p>

The results from rounds 15 to 30 are mean-averaged in order to consider how each notion of fairness settles as the model converges. It is clear that fairness is sensitive to the approach, data setting, and heterogeneity and it is anticipated that numerous other factors will affect fairness. Key, previously unobtainable insights that can be drawn from this subset of systems are as follows, demonstrating that Federated Fairness Analytics enable a unique perspective to observe systems:</p>

It is particularly interesting to observe that for the FEMNIST task, Ditto directly trades performance for fairness and q-FedAvg under performs. Whereas for NSL-KDD q-FedAvg offers the best in fairness and performance. In all cases, fairness reduces with statistical heterogeneity, typically by a greater margin than a fairness-conscious approach can remedy.

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Primarily, it should be clear, that fairness is still an unsolved problem in FL. However, the objective of this work was not to resolve unfairness but to define and measure it, in order to evaluate FL systems. Building on existing literature, we developed of a set of four complete, symptom-driven notions which together encapsulate how unfairness can manifest itself in FL. Each notion is paired with a quantifiable metric; these metrics underpin Federated Fairness Analytics - the methodology to actively measure fairness at training time. The analytics enable fairness-explainable-AI by producing insights into the effects of design decisions on fairness that were previously not possible. This paper analysed the fairness performance of Twenty-Four different FL systems which vary in FL approach, ML task, data setting and heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that fairness typically drops with increases in statistical heterogeneity or decreases in client participation rate. Under our definition, fairness-conscious FL approaches, Ditto and q-FedAvg are not shown to improve fairness in iid data settings where fairness is typically high and offer only marginal improvements in fairness in some non-iid settings. This development opens avenues for a plethora of further experiments and could be a key enabler to improve fairness. Many approaches to reduce unfairness should be tested but this may include augmenting datasets with generative-AI to reduce statistical heterogeneity or utilising the measures of fairness as an optimisation objective.

<p id="Sx7.p2.2" class="ltx_p">The main limitation of Federated Fairness Analytics is the non-linearity of the metrics - this is a limitation of Jain’s fairness index and may limit intuitive interpretation and comparison of results. Consideration should be given to whether linear measures such as the Gini coefficient may be more suitable than JFI and if it can be applied for all four metrics such that their numerical meaning is directly translatable. Industry hardening would also require improving scalability.

Future experimentation may aim to collect further data on the effects of varying number of participating clients, types of heterogeneity (also modulating heterogeneity, for example through the Dirichlet <math id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx7.p2.2.m2.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> parameter), complexity of models and datasets, approaches and effects of privacy-enhancing techniques such as differential privacy. It would also be interesting to investigate more future-realistic FL scenarios by moving from simulation to networks of heterogeneous devices. Finally, investigating the fairness performance in systems utilising unsupervised learning, foundational models and fine-tuning is crucial to align with current and future trends in FL.</p>
