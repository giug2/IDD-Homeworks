<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an distributed machine learning diagram
that enables multiple clients
to collaboratively train a global model
without sharing their private local data.
However,
FL systems are vulnerable to attacks that are happening
in malicious clients
through data poisoning and model poisoning
who can deteriorate the aggregated global model’s performance.
Existing defense methods typically focus on mitigating
specific types of poisoning,
and are often ineffective against unseen types of attack.
These methods also assume an attack happened moderately
while is not always holds true in real.
Consequently,
these methods can significantly fail
in terms of accuracy and robustness
when detecting and addressing updates
from attacked malicious clients.
To overcome these challenges,
in this work,
we propose a simple yet effective framework to detect malicious clients,
namely Confidence-Aware Defense (CAD),
that utilizes the confidence scores
of local models as criteria
to evaluate the reliability of local updates.
Our key insight is that malicious attacks,
regardless of attack type,
will cause the model to deviate from its previous state,
thus leading to increased uncertainty when making predictions.
Therefore,
CAD is comprehensively effective
for both model poisoning and data poisoning attacks
by accurately identifying and mitigating potential malicious updates,
even under varying degrees of attacks and data heterogeneity.
Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly
enhances the robustness of FL systems against
various types of attacks across various scenarios
by achieving higher model accuracy
and stability.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is a distributed machine learning paradigm
that allows multiple clients
to collaboratively train a global model
without sharing their local data.
FL offers significant privacy protection,
therefore making it highly attractive
for privacy-sensitive applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rodríguez-Barroso et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
However,
the decentralized nature of FL also introduces security challenges:
malicious attacks happened in distributed local clients
can degrade the global model’s performance
through data poisoning and model poisoning attacks,
leading to degraded predictions
and potentially catastrophic consequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fang and Chen <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Kumar, Mohan, and Cenkeramaddi <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
As illustrated in Fig <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Mitigating Malicious Attacks in Federated Learning via Confidence-aware Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
malicious attacks
can significantly hinder the convergence of DNN model
and even completely cause collapse.
Therefore,
developing effective methods to detect and defend against malicious attacks
is crucial in ensuring the security and robustness of FL systems.</p>

</figure>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are two main types of attacks in a FL system:
model poisoning and data poisoning,
categorized by where the attack occurs.
Model poisoning attacks involve directly manipulating the model updates
sent by the clients to the central server.
Among these,
Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shi et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>
are the most representative,
where malicious clients intentionally
send arbitrary or random updates
to disrupt the learning process
and significantly degrade the performance
of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fang et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Bhagoji et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
In contrast,
data poisoning attacks occur
when malicious clients intentionally
corrupt their local training data
to mislead the global model
during the training process,
such as label shuffle,
where the data-label pairs are randomly reassigned
that can confuse the globally updated local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tolpegin et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Xie et al. <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Both attack types pose significant threats,
and cause the global model to make incorrect predictions,
degrading its accuracy and robustness.
These challenges underscore the urgent need
for effective detection and defense mechanisms
capable of addressing various attack types.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Existing defense mechanisms primarily target
specific types of poisoning attacks,
under a moderate attack.
Byzantine-robust methods
such as Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Blanchard et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>
and Trimmed Mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yin et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>
aim to mitigate the impact of outliers
among client updates but often fall short
when dealing with data poisoning attacks.
However,
these methods generally assume that the majority of clients are honest,
which may not hold true in practical scenarios
where the proportion of malicious clients is significant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fang et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Recent advanced methods are primarily
driven by the analysis of fine-grained model consistency.
In that context,
FLDetector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang and et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> improves upon existing defenses by detecting malicious clients through the consistency of their model updates across historical iterations,
and flags clients whose updates deviate significantly.
DeFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> focuses on critical learning periods
within the training process
to determine the gradient changes and remove malicious clients.
FedRoLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gang Yan and Li <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> enhances robustness by analyzing the per-layer consistency
of model updates
and conducts aggregation
based on the alignment of updates at each layer.
However, these methods overlook the uncertainty in model updates
and fail to address various types of both poisoning attacks comprehensively.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given the inherent uncertainty of FL systems
and the attacks’ complexity,
being capable of addressing only certain types of attack
is far from sufficient.
A robust and comprehensive defense approach
is needed to ensure the integrity
and reliability
of the global model
across all scenarios,
including various types of attacks
with differing levels of severity
and degrees of data heterogeneity.
To meet this demand,
we propose a simple yet effective defense model,
termed Confidence-Aware Defense (CAD),
based on the confidence scores of clients’ local models,
which measures how certain a model is about its predictions,
with higher scores indicating greater certainty
and lower scores reflect higher uncertainty.
Our key insight is that malicious attacks,
regardless of attack type,
will cause the model to deviate from its previous state,
thus leading to increased uncertainty in its predictions.
Therefore,
CAD is comprehensively effective
for both model poisoning and data poisoning attacks.
Specifically, the proposed approach includes the following steps:
1. Collecting confidence scores of each client update:
During each training round,
we collect the confidence scores of model updates from each client.
2. Establishing confidence boundaries:
Based on the collected confidence scores,
we assess the uncertainty of each client model update
and set the boundaries as a reference.
3. Detecting and handling malicious updates:
Based on the boundaries,
we identify updates with high uncertainty
and take appropriate actions,
such as discarding or adjusting these updates.

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Federated Learning (FL)</h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a decentralized machine learning diagram
that enables multiple clients to
collaboratively train a shared global model
while keeping their local data private.
In FL, the learning process is divided into two main stages:
local training and global aggregation.
During the local training phase,
each client trains a local model using its private dataset.
This involves updating the model parameters based on the local data,
which protects privacy by not allowing raw data to leave the client’s device.
Once the local training is complete,
the clients send their updated model parameters to a central server for global aggregation,
in which the central server aggregates
the received model updates from participating clients
to form a new global model.
This aggregation can be done by various approaches,
the most common is the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
The FedAvg algorithm computes the weighted average
of the model parameters from all clients
to form a global model.
Despite the advantages of FL in preserving data privacy,
the decentralized nature of this learning paradigm
makes it vulnerable to various types of attacks
either caused by data or model poisoning.
Therefore,
it is crucial to develop efficient and robust
defense mechanisms that can identify
and mitigate the impact of malicious activities.</p>

Common strategies include label flipping,

These attacks aim to bias the model’s training process,

<div id="Sx2.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To detect and mitigate the aforementioned attacks, numerous works have been proposed recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fang and Chen <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Yan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Zhang and et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Gang Yan and Li <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>.
DeFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> is proposed as a defense mechanism
that secures critical learning periods during the training process

Zhang <em id="Sx2.SSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang and et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> introduced FLDetector to integrate statistical analysis, anomaly detection,

FedRoLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gang Yan and Li <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> strengthens robustness by analyzing per-layer consistency in model updates and conducting aggregation based on the alignment of updates at each layer.
Despite the improved accuracy in detecting malicious clients, these existing methods are often tailored to specific types of attacks. Additionally, they typically rely on the fragile assumption that the attack intensity is moderate,
meaning less than 25% of the participating clients are malicious,
which may not hold in a practical FL system where higher proportions of malicious clients can be present.
To resolve these limitations,
in this paper,
we propose the CAD model
to address both types of attacks and varying intensities.</p>

In this work,
motivated by the observation that
malicious attack will disrupt the local model’s
convergence against the original global initialization,
and making the learned model less confident in the output,
we propose to use per-client confidence accumulation
as the index to determine the quality of the learned model.
Note that we use Eq. (<a href="#Sx2.E2" title="In Model Confidence and Uncertainty ‣ Related Work ‣ Mitigating Malicious Attacks in Federated Learning via Confidence-aware Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) solely for estimating the confidence score,
in contrast to the original design of Super Loss which uses it as a regularization term.
The rationale is that our goal is to make the CAD model
versatile and applicable to various tasks,
and to explicitly demonstrate that the effectiveness
stems from the detection algorithm
rather than modifications to the loss function.</p>

The proposed Confidence-Aware Defense (CAD) framework.
It encompasses five key steps:
1. Initialize the global model and distribute it to clients.
2. Clients train their personalized, confidence-aware local models.
3. Clients upload their local models and associated confidence scores to the server.
4. The server identifies potentially malicious clients through confidence clustering.
5. The server aggregates the local models of honest clients
by re-weighted aggregation.

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After normalizing the per-client confidence scores,
the next step is to cluster the clients into groups
of honest and potentially malicious clients.
The rationale for such clustering
is based on the assumption that
clients can be divided into two groups:
honest clients with higher confidence scores
and potentially malicious clients with lower confidence scores.
To achieve this,
we apply two-way k-means clustering
to the normalized confidence scores

We evaluated the robustness
of our CAD model
under three degrees of attack severity
defined by the percentage of malicious clients:
<span id="Sx4.SSx1.SSSx5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">moderate</span> (25%),
<span id="Sx4.SSx1.SSSx5.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">severe</span> (50%),
and <span id="Sx4.SSx1.SSSx5.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">extreme</span> (75%).
For data poisoning attacks,
confidence scores were directly obtained
during model training.
For model poisoning attacks,
confidence scores were obtained
by further running inference on local training data
before sending it to the parameter server.
We implemented our defenses,
in PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Paszke et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated the robustness of the proposed CAD model
and other state-of-the-art defenses
under different levels of attack intensity
with the CIFAR-10 dataset with the VGG model.
The results, as shown in Table <a href="#Sx4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Experiments ‣ Mitigating Malicious Attacks in Federated Learning via Confidence-aware Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>,
indicate that under moderate attacks (25% malicious clients),
most defense methods perform reasonably well,
with our CAD model
achieving the highest accuracy
across all attack types.
However, as the intensity of the attacks
increases to severe (50%) and extreme (75%),
the performance of most methods significantly deteriorates.
In contrast,
the CAD model consistently
maintains high accuracy and robustness
by outperforming other methods under all attack intensities.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of
our confidence-based detection
and re-weighted aggregation approach
in mitigating the impact of various attack types,
even under severe attack conditions.</p>

of CAD with other state-of-the-art defense methods
across different models and datasets.
The results demonstrate that CAD consistently outperforms
other defenses with high accuracy under various attacks.
For MNIST with MLP,
most defense methods perform well under label shuffling attacks,
but CAD achieves the highest accuracy
across all attack types.
Similarly,
for Fashion MNIST with AlexNet,
CAD maintains superior performance,
especially against LIE and MM attacks,
where other methods
significantly collapsed in accuracy.
In the CIFAR-10 dataset,
both with VGG-11 and AlexNet models,
the robustness of CAD stands out.
While other defenses struggle to converge,
particularly under LIE and MM attacks,
CAD consistently achieves the best results.
This highlights the effectiveness of our method
in providing robust defense against various attacks,
even under different model and dataset combinations.
These results demonstrated that CAD
is not only effective in mitigating attacks for a specific benchmark
but also adaptable to various models and datasets,
thereby making it a reliable defense method.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated the detection performance
of our proposed CAD model
under LIE and label shuffle attack scenarios
considering both moderate and severe intensities.
The evaluation was conducted on the Cifar10 dataset with the VGG-11 model
at full attack setting.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Malicious Clients Detection Accuracy. ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Experiments ‣ Mitigating Malicious Attacks in Federated Learning via Confidence-aware Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>,
our CAD model can accurately detect malicious clients,
and converge to high TPR and low FPR
after only a few training rounds.
Therefore,
it can exclude malicious clients and lead to a significant improvement in overall performance,
as shown in the blue line over the orange line.
Its advantage is more obvious when
more clients are being attacked,
with detection accuracy remaining high and stable
even under severe attack conditions
while the FedAvg was collapsed.
This demonstrates that CAD
is effective under varying intensities
and thereby significantly enhances model performance compared to the FedAvg baseline.</p>

It can be observed that
the re-weighting operation can consistently enhance performance,
especially at higher attack rates.
The improvement is particularly clear in “Severe” and “Extreme” conditions,
with detecting attacks like LIE and MinSum benefiting the most.
This effectiveness is likely due to the fact
that only a few honest clients remain under high attack rates,
therefore, it is crucial to identify and prioritize them.
This further demonstrates that the confidence score is a reliable metric
for assessing the quality of client models,
thereby supporting the underlying assumption
of our confidence-aware CAD model.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper,
we proposed the CAD model,
an attack defense mechanism for FL
that achieves accurate malicious client detection
to address both model poisoning and data poisoning attacks.
The proposed CAD model estimates per-client confidence scores
to reflect the model’s uncertainty,
which are then referred
to identify clients into honest and malicious categories.
By re-weighting the contributions of honest clients
based on their confidence scores,
CAD model can make the best use of honest clients
even under severe attack when there is only a handful of honest clients available,
so that it can enhance the robustness
of the global model.
Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks
with non-IID data demonstrated that CAD can
notably enhance the accuracy,
stability,
and robustness of FL systems.</p>
