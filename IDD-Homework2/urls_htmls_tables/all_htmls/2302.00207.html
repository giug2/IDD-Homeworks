<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rising demand for wireless services and increased awareness of the need for data protection, existing network traffic analysis and management architectures are facing unprecedented challenges in classifying and synthesizing the increasingly diverse services and applications. This paper proposes FS-GAN, a federated self-supervised learning framework to support automatic traffic analysis and synthesis over a large number of heterogeneous datasets. FS-GAN is composed of multiple distributed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a set of generators, each being designed to generate synthesized data samples following the distribution of an individual service traffic, and each discriminator being trained to differentiate the synthesized data samples and the real data samples of a local dataset. A federated learning-based framework is adopted to coordinate local model training processes of different GANs across different datasets. FS-GAN can classify data of unknown types of service and create synthetic samples that capture the traffic distribution of the unknown types. We prove that FS-GAN can minimize the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the distribution of real data across all the datasets and that of the synthesized data samples. FS-GAN also maximizes the JSD among the distributions of data samples created by different generators, resulting in each generator producing synthetic data samples that follow the same distribution as one particular service type. Extensive simulation results show that the classification accuracy of FS-GAN achieves over <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">20\%</annotation></semantics></math> improvement in average compared to the state-of-the-art clustering-based traffic analysis algorithms.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Telecommunication technologies have evolved tremendously over the past few decades, driven by innovative services and applications in a wide range of verticals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In particular, recently standardized 5G technology introduces three major use cases: eMBB (enhanced Mobile BroadBand), URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications), with promises to enable novel applications including IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. According to recent reports<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the next-generation mobile technologies, e.g., B5G and 6G, are expected to further extend the application scenarios of 5G by bringing more diverse and innovative services, such as holographic-type communications, Tactile Internet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, semantic communications<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and others<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As more services and applications are introduced and adopted at different times in different regions, network traffic analysis and management face unprecedented challenges. In particular, the diverse demands and requirements of different services significantly increase the dynamics of network traffic, making traffic prediction, network planning, resource allocation and scheduling more challenging than before <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Most existing solutions rely on regression or convolutional neural network (CNN)-based supervised learning to fit historical data and accordingly classify the traffic of existing services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These solutions often require a large amount of manually labeled datasets, which may not be practically feasible to obtain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Recent works employ clustering-based unsupervised learning solutions to analyze and cluster unknown traffic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, these solutions often suffer from limited accuracy and cannot be applied to predict or keep track of highly mixed and evolving service traffic flows. There is a pressing need to develop intelligent traffic analysis and classification solutions that can automatically identify known services and classify/label unknown services and data samples that emerge in decentralized datasets across various locations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One promising solution to the above challenges is self-supervised learning, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">a novel algorithmic framework that can learn features and representations without requiring any labeled data samples for training machine learning (ML) models. Self-supervised learning combines the advantages of supervised-learning and unsupervised-learning by first solving some carefully designed pretext tasks to automatically create pseudo-labels for the unlabelled data samples. It then employs supervised-learning-based downstream training tasks to construct ML models based on pseudo-labelled dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Due to its potential to significantly improve data efficiency and model generality, self-supervised learning is commonly believed to be one of the key enablers for the ‘next artificial intelligence revolution”<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">Despite their potential, most existing works on self-supervised learning focus on designing pretext tasks that utilize the attributes of images or videos, such as image orientation, gray-scale image colorization, and image jigsaw puzzle solving, none of which can be applied to analyze network traffic datasets. Also, compared to image data samples, each consists of rich (pixel-level) information with well-known representation features and attributes, network packets generally have much smaller sizes. The data streams communicated throughout the network contain highly mixed traffic types and data packets associated with different services may exhibit very similar frame patterns that are challenging to classify. There is still no commonly known attributes of data packets associated with each individual service. <span id="S1.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text">The increasingly stringent requirements on the responsiveness of smart services and the growing awareness of data protection and network security further exacerbate the above challenges. This is especially the case, considering that most existing self-supervised learning solutions are cloud-based in which every mobile device must upload its locally collected data samples to a cloud server and wait for feedback before making decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> These solutions are known to suffer from long communication delay and risk of privacy leakage caused by showing raw data. To address these issues, edge intelligence has been recently introduced, which enables distributed data processing and learning over a large number of low-cost, often decentralized edge devices, e.g., mobile edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. It is considered one of the most sought-after functions in B5G/6G.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">One of the challenges of implementing edge intelligence is to develop simple and effective algorithmic solutions for decentralized data learning and processing over large resource-limited wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
As an emerging distributed AI solution, federated learning (FL) allows collaborative construction of ML models without exposing any raw data across decentralized datasets. Integrating FL with self-supervised learning will have the potential to significantly reduce communication overhead, enhance data protection, and improve efficiency of model training. <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text">Unfortunately, conventional FL approaches often suffer from slow convergence and bias when the distributions of traffic across different datasets are highly heterogeneous and unbalanced. In fact, the most commonly used federated learning solution, FedAvg, can only be applied when all decentralized datasets observe the same set of features. Furthermore, most existing FL solutions are based on supervised learning, which require high-quality labeled samples across all decentralized datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Currently, there is no simple and effective self-supervised learning solution that allows joint model construction based on heterogeneous datasets.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose the federated self-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (FS-GAN), a novel framework for distributed traffic analysis and synthesis over decentralized datasets consisting of highly heterogeneous and unbalanced traffic types. <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text">FS-GAN is comprised of multiple decentralized GANs, deployed at a set of edge servers, each of which can access an exclusive set of data samples associated with a combination of local services. Different edge servers can access different combinations of services. A set of generators is deployed at the edge servers or virtual machines that offer computational functions.<span id="S1.p7.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> In contrast, each discriminator is implemented at an edge server and has been assigned with an exclusive right to access a local dataset requiring a certain privacy protection for local data samples. FS-GAN learns to create synthetic data samples that capture the statistical features of real data (i.e., its distribution) obtained from each individual type of services to support automatic traffic classification. <span id="S1.p7.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Compared to a traditional GAN, FS-GAN provides three unique advantages. First, it supports collaborative model construction based on decentralized datasets by adopting a federated learning-based approach to coordinate model training at different edge servers. Second, it addresses the model collapse problem suffered by many GAN-based approaches by associating a classifier with each local datatset to classify samples generated by different generators. Third, FS-GAN does not require any labeled samples to train the model; rather, it adopts a self-supervised learning-based approach that automatically assigns different pseudo-labels to synthesized data samples generated by different generators. Compared to a traditional network data classification/clustering solution, the proposed FS-GAN trains multiple generators, each of which is capable of synthesizing data traffic for a given service. These features of FS-GAN make it possible to further improve the performance of data traffic classification, especially when traffic samples of different services are highly unbalanced, i.e., some services have much fewer data samples than others. They also make FS-GAN applicable to a wide range of scenarios and use cases that involve traffic prediction and synthesis, such as dynamic network slicing that involves multi-service traffic tracking and prediction, unknown attack detection, and prediction-based network planning.<span id="S1.p7.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
We conduct extensive simulations based on real-world traffic associated with ten popular services applications including email, FTP, video and audio chat, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a novel framework called FS-GAN that exploits concepts from GAN, FL, and self-supervised learning to enable automatic learning, synthesis, and classification of heterogeneous traffic over decentralized datasets.
Compared to regression-based clustering solutions, which separate data samples based on a single or a limited number of pre-selected features, FS-GAN autonomously creates synthetic samples with pseudo-labels to capture the distributions of local mixtures of traffic types and then applies supervised-learning-like solutions to further improve the classification performance. To the best of our knowledge, FS-GAN is the first network traffic synthesis and classification solution that uses self-supervised learning.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main architecture, including the key components and algorithmic procedures of FS-GAN, is presented in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 Architecture Overview ‣ 3 Architecture Overview and Application Scenarios ‣ Distributed Traffic Synthesis and Classification in Edge Networks: A Federated Self-supervised Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. FS-GAN consists of: (1) multiple generators that create synthetic samples whose statistical distribution is similar to that of real traffic in local datasets, and (2) multiple discriminators, each of which discriminator tries to differentiate the real traffic from the synthetic samples produced by the generators. Our proposed FS-GAN framework employs the following three procedures:</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(1) Local Data Synthesis:</span>
One discriminator is deployed in each edge server with exclusive right access to a local dataset. Each discriminator is jointly trained with several associated generators. Although GANs, in general, have high flexibility in generating synthetic samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, they suffer from the so-called <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model collapsing problem</span>, where the generator learns to produce synthetic samples with extremely limited diversity, e.g., samples that only capture the data distribution of a single traffic type or a fixed mixture of a given set of traffic types.
To tackle this problem, we borrow the idea of multi-generator GANs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> and assign a pseudo-label to each generated sample to indicate which generator the sample came from. As will be proven later, a generator that is locally trained with a discriminator is able to create synthetic data samples that match the data distribution of the real traffic in the local dataset.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(2) Global Model Coordination:</span>
The local models trained by the discriminators and generators will be periodically uploaded to a global model coordinator. The coordinator can be deployed at one of the edge servers or at the cloud data center. One straightforward implementation of model coordination is to adopt FL solutions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, in which the local model parameters (of generators and/or discriminators) are aggregated, e.g., averaged in FedAvg algorithm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>, to form an updated global model that is then broadcasted to edge servers. Note that the number of model parameters from local edge servers will affect the communication efficiency. In this paper, we consider two model coordination schemes:</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">C-II requires less model-related data to be exchanged between edge servers and the coordinator, resulting in a higher communication efficiency. However, as will be shown later in this paper, C-I has faster convergence than C-II, which in some cases compensates for the extra communication overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the local data synthesis procedure, each discriminator only determines whether the data samples belong to a real traffic or are synthetic data produced by generators. After the global model coordination, all the discriminators should be able to differentiate real data in <span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">any</span> local dataset from synthetic data generated by <span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">any</span> generator. Similarly, the generators will be able to capture richer features across different local datasets. To address the model collapsing problem, we introduce a classifier in each local datatset to classify samples from different generators. As shown in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 FS-GAN Design and Theoretical Analysis ‣ Distributed Traffic Synthesis and Classification in Edge Networks: A Federated Self-supervised Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, this classifier increases the divergence of the synthetic data distributions of different generators, hence alleviating the model collapsing problem of traditional GANs.</p>

The aforementioned trained and updated classifier creates pseudo-labels for synthetic samples generated by different generators. As the generators become more capable of producing close-to-real synthetic data, the classifier associated with each discriminator will naturally support data classification and self-labeling of real traffic that arrive in the future. We show that the classifier actually shares the same model parameters as the locally trained discriminator, and therefore does not require any extra effort for model training.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We present a theoretical analysis that proves the effectiveness of the FS-GAN framework. In particular, we prove that FS-GAN possesses two important properties: (1) the difference between the distributions of the mixture of the synthetic data generated by generators and that of the real traffic data distribution is minimized, and (2) the <span id="S3.SS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text">JSD</span> divergence of the distributions of synthetic data samples generated by different generators is maximized. Based on these properties, we prove the main result of this paper, namely, the synthetic data samples generated by each individual generator captures the real traffic distribution of each individual traffic type, and that the classifier can differentiate all the synthetic samples coming from different generators, if the distributions of the traffic data associated with different services are separable.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text">Compared to existing self-supervised learning solutions, FS-GAN provides the following unique advantages that make it more suitable for network traffic classification problems. First, FS-GAN can be applied to a large network with highly decentralized and imbalanced traffic distribution with data privacy protection requirements. Second, FS-GAN does not require any pre-labeling of data, which makes it suitable for many of today’s networking systems that involve a large volume of unlabeled network traffic datasets that are prohibitively expensive to label. Third, the data synthesizing capability of FS-GAN makes it possible to be applied in many emerging networking services that involve traffic prediction and synthesis.<span id="S3.SS1.p8.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

5G NR release 16 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> introduced the concept of network slicing, which focuses on isolating and preserving partitions of network resources and functions, commonly referred to as <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">slices</span>. These slices are tailored and orchestrated to support applications with diverse QoS requirements. One of the key challenges in network slicing is now to keep track of the traffic demands of potentially unknown applications, so the appropriate amount of resources can be reserved while meeting the needs of these applications. FS-GAN can be directly applied to classify and keep track of the needs of different services from a highly mixed traffic. It can also assist the network slicing manager in identifying newly observed service traffic types that do not have a sufficient amount of pre-labeled data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous section, the generators associated with a local discriminator produce synthetic data samples that capture the distributions of different traffic types in the local dataset. However, different local datasets may have different mixtures of traffic. It is therefore desirable to train a global model that can capture the diverse traffic across all local datasets. We adopt the FL-based framework to coordinate the local model training procedures without requiring any exchange of local datasets. One of the key ideas in FL is to coordinate different local model training procures via their model parameters. In one of the popular FL solutions, called FedAvg, each edge server periodically uploads its locally trained models to a global coordinator. The uploaded models are then averaged to form an updated global model, which will be broadcasted to all edge servers.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in the previous procedures, the classifier shares the same network parameters with the local discriminator. Therefore, this classifier can be updated in the global model coordination procedure to classify and create pseudo-labels for the synthetic samples according to their corresponding generators. This classifier will also be able to classify the real data associated with all traffic types in all datasets.
Since this classifier is a part of the training process of FS-GAN and is trained based on the pseudo-labeled synthetic datasets, it does not introduce any extra training efforts. </p>

In particular, compared to the federated learning which requires all the decentralized datasets to share the same combinations of data features, FS-GAN allows edge servers with different combinations of service traffics to jointly construct a shared model that can identify and synthesize service traffics of all the edge servers. Also, FS-GAN addresses the model collapse problem of GAN by reuse the model trained by the discriminator. Furthermore, as described in Section 4.4, FS-GAN does not introduce any new components or increase the complexity, compared to traditional federated GAN. This further justifies the flexibility and practicality of FS-GAN in practical networking systems.

Each edge server ia simuylated with a TITAN X GPU running on Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.6, CUDA 10.0 and PyTorch 1.3.1. The training process between edge servers is simulated using the PySyft framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>.

It can be observed that FS-GAN achieves the best performance of all tested solutions in all three performance metrics. In particular, DEC, IDEC, and DCN use deep neural networks to recover different latent representations for clustering. Compared to K-means++, which directly searches for cluster centers or centroids of the data samples, deep-learning-based solutions often achieve better performance. FS-GAN takes a novel approach by first generating synthetic data samples with pseudo-labels and then training a classifier based on the labeled dataset. In some senses, this approach addresses the poor performance caused by the lack of labelled dataset and can result in improved performance when the quality of the pseudo-labeled synthetic data samples is high.</p>

Note that, compared to FS-GAN, SD-GAN requires labelled datasets to learn a prior information to guide the learning process, it also requires an extra neural network model to perform the data clustering and peudo-labelling.

The learning results under one centralized dataset is also presented. We can see that both the learning time and performance of FS-GAN are slightly degraded compared with a centralized setting, because the model aggregation procedure is no longer needed.
It can be observed that the computational load is most sensitive to the size of the dataset. Compared to scheme C-I, Scheme C-II always results in slightly more computational load for training. This is because, in scheme C-I, both generators and discriminators are coordinated, which accelerates convergence of the model training and leads to reduced overall computational time. The improved performance offered by Scheme C-I over C-II can be further shown in the <span id="S5.SS2.p8.4.1" class="ltx_text">NMI</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p8.4.2" class="ltx_text">ACC</span> metrics. More specifically, C-I always exhibits a more accurate clustering performance than C-II when the number of training rounds is fixed.
C-I and C-II offer similar performance in terms of RI. This is because RI measures the combined performance of the correct solutions over all the clustering results, instead of the highest performance among individual classes as <span id="S5.SS2.p8.4.3" class="ltx_text">NMI</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p8.4.4" class="ltx_text">ACC</span>. Therefore, the performance difference in <span id="S5.SS2.p8.4.5" class="ltx_text">RI</span> achieved by different schemes is always smaller than that of the other two performance metrics.</p>

We compare the default numbers of synthetic samples produced by each scheme that are associated with different services when the same input is employed. It can be observed that different generators tend to produce different numbers of synthetic samples. For example, among all six types of services, SCP (download) is the least popular service to be synthesized with the least number of synthesized data samples, e.g., less than 0.02% of total synthesized samples produced by F-GAN(C-I, six-G) falls into this service category.
We, however, observe that FS-GAN, especially C-I scheme with six generators, produces relatively uniform number of samples for different services. This means that FS-GAN offers the best performance in terms of balancing synthesized data samples.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed FS-GAN, a federated self-supervised learning framework to automatically recognize, classify, and synthesize different types of traffic over a large number of decentralized datasets. FS-GAN consists of three components: local data synthesis, global model coordination, and self-supervised learning. We adopted an FL-like approach and proved that our jointly trained global model can simultaneously minimize the JSD between the distribution of real data across all the datasets and that of the synthesized data samples.It also maximizes the JSD among the distributions of data samples created by different generators. Simulation results show that FS-GAN can achieve significant performance improvement over state-of-art data clustering solutions, and almost five times improvement over the federated GAN solutions in terms of data synthesis diversity.</p>
