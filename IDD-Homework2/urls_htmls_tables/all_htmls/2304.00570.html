<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">Low-count PET is an efficient way to reduce radiation exposure and acquisition time, but the reconstructed images often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus affecting diagnosis and other downstream tasks. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the denoising network’s weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging data from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed that FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous baseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three institutions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a commonly used functional imaging
modality with wide applications in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and biomedical research. To reconstruct high-quality PET, the patient is injected with a customized dose of radioactive tracer which inevitably introduces radiation exposure to both patients and healthcare providers. Adhere to the principle of As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), minimizing the radiation dose is of great interest to patients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, particularly for PET applications where serial scans are commonly required. However, reducing the injection dose in PET would result in increased image noise, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and image artifacts, which would jeopardize the downstream clinical tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To generate high-quality PET from low-count PET, deep learning-based low-count PET imaging methods have been extensively explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which have demonstrated superior performance than conventional methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. While deep learning-based methods achieve promising performance, they often rely on training using diverse and large-scale paired low-count and full-count datasets that are often prohibitively expensive and difficult to collect. Even though we can alleviate this issue through building a centralized large-scale dataset by transferring all institutional data, the concerns of medical data privacy and security, the difficulty of building data transfer and warehouse protocol, and the laborious process make it challenging to implement this solution in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a solution to address data privacy concerns in training deep models. This approach enables different local clients to collaboratively learn using their own data and computing resources, without sharing any private data. A client-to-cloud platform is established where the cloud server periodically communicates with local clients to collect local models. These models are then aggregated to generate a global model that is redistributed to the local clients for further local updates. Unlike traditional methods where local data is required to be directly transferred for global training, FL only involves the exchange of model parameters or gradients. As a result, FL can potentially solve the data privacy concerns for training a global model. In the context of low-count PET imaging, the different institutions may have different low-count protocols, different PET systems from different vendors, different reconstructions, and different post-processing protocols, thus can lead to significant data heterogeneity and domain shifts. Unfortunately, it is challenging to generalize a global model trained from the classical FL algorithm, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, to different institutions due to different data distributions at each local site. Thus, personalized federated learning is desirable to address this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Previous works have attempted to address the domain shift issues, but mainly focus on image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In the application of accelerated MR reconstruction using FL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> first proposed to address the domain shift issue by iteratively aligning the latent feature of UNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> between target and other client sites. However, their cross-site strategy requires the target client to share both the latent feature and the network parameter with other client sites in each communication round, which could result in additional data privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a UNet with a globally shared encoder for generalized representation learning and a client-specific decoder for domain-specific reconstruction, but the network architecture is limited to UNet or its variants. While achieving promising performance for the MR reconstruction task, the network architecture is limited to UNet or its variants due to the constraint in their FL algorithm designs. Additionally, instead of using simple encoder-decoder structures for improving image quality, state-of-the-art deep learning-based image restoration networks often deploy advanced designs, such as original resolution restoration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, recurrent restoration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, and multi-stage restoration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Moreover, all the previous works are limited to 2D MRI reconstruction while PET requires 3D processing. In the application of low-count PET denoising using FL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposed the first FL study for low-count PET reconstruction. However, their study was performed only on simulation experiments with heterogeneous low-count data generated from one scanner at one site. In addition, their generation of personalized models relied on local fine-tuning after global training from FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which may not be optimal. Therefore, the development of 3D personalized federated learning framework and conducting studies with real-world multi-institutional low-count PET imaging data is desirable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on deep feature transformation networks (FedFTN) and perform studies on real-world multi-institutional low-count PET data collected from three medical institutions across three continents, with multiple low-count levels contained at each institution. The general idea is to use a Feature Transformation Network (FTN) to modulate the features in the denoising network. During federated training, the FTNs are kept local, while only the denoising networks’ parameters at different institutions are shared and aggregated at the central server. The FTNs are only trained locally to modulate the features from the denoising network, thus enabling personalized PET denoising at each institution. The input to the FTN is the low-count level for individual patients, thus also allowing using a single unified model for multiple low-count levels’ denoising at each institution. In addition, we propose a Global Weight Constraint (GWC) loss which helps stabilize the local weight updates of the denoising network during the federated reconstruction learning. Our experimental result on the real-world multi-institutional low-count PET datasets demonstrates that our FedFTN can generate superior low-count PET denoising results as compared to previous federated reconstruction learning methods, as well as locally trained models.</p>

Although conventional methods like Gaussian filtering are standard post-processing techniques for PET reconstruction, they tend to oversmooth the image and have difficulty preserving local structures under low-count conditions with amplified noise. On the other hand, deep learning-based denoising methods have been extensively explored for low-count PET and have demonstrated promising results. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed to use a 2D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with UNet as a generator to predict full-count PET images from low-count PET images. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed the use of a 3D conditional GAN to directly translate 3D low-count PET images to full-count PET images. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> also proposed to use a 3D Wasserstein GAN to stabilize GAN training and to improve the low-count PET denoising performance. Based on previous GAN designs, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> further proposed to reinforce the denoising performance by incorporating patient-specific information. In parallel to using only the low-count PET images as network input, low-count PET denoising facilitated by other imaging modalities has also been explored. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> developed an auto-context CNN using both low-count PET images and T1 MR images as inputs for full-count PET generation. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed to input low-count PET images along with multi-contrast MR images into a UNet for ultra-low-count PET denoising. There were also recent developments on unifying the low-count PET denoising model for multiple low-count levels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In addition to these previous studies on static low-count PET, methods have also been developed for simultaneous motion correction and low-count PET reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, and have demonstrated further improved reconstruction quality. Even though deep learning-based methods have shown great promise in improving low-count PET images, these methods have so far been studied only within single institutions, where a single low-count protocol, identical PET system, and reconstruction protocol are assumed. Investigation on how to train generalizable reconstruction models using multi-institutional low-count data with non-identical distribution while addressing data privacy issues is of great significance and remains relatively unexplored.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning for Reconstruction.</span> FL with a decentralized learning framework enables multiple local institutions to collaborate in training shared models while maintaining their local data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, traditional FL algorithms, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, do not adequately address the domain shift issue, which arises due to differences in data distribution across clients despite allowing collaborative training without sharing data. To overcome this limitation, recent studies have proposed personalized federated learning strategies in medical image reconstruction tasks. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed federated learning with cross-site modeling (FLCM) to address domain shift issues in 2D MR reconstruction by iteratively aligning the latent feature distribution between clients. However, FLCM’s requirement for frequent communication between clients and latent vectors increases the communication cost and risk of potential privacy leakage. On the other hand, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed using a client-specific decoder in a UNet to reduce domain shift while only uploading and aggregating the encoder’s parameters. To further enable flexible MRI accelerated imaging operator across sites and improve generalizability, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed FedGIMP that aims to generate site-specific MRI prior which uses a mapper network to produce site-specific latents for the generative network given a site index. A similar strategy has been also adapted to multi-contrast MRI synthesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Although these methods show promising performance, they have only been tested on 2D MRI reconstruction tasks, and many rely on specific network architecture, e.g. UNet or Auto-encoder, with latent representation for domain alignment and personalization. They may not generalize well to applications requiring other network architectures, such as cascade/recurrent/multistage network designs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, for better reconstruction quality. For CT reconstruction using FL, strategies have also been developed to adapt to different CT distributions from different sparse-view CT (SVCT) protocols. For example, with simulated multi-institutional 2D CT data, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposed to extend the PDF framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> into a hypernet-based FL framework, where the normalization parameter generator sub-networks were kept locally to adapt to different SVCT distributions. For low-count PET denoising, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposed the first FL study for low-count PET imaging. However, their study was limited to simulation experiments with heterogeneous low-count data generated from one scanner at one site. Furthermore, their approach of generating personalized models relied on local fine-tuning after global training from FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which may not be optimal. Therefore, there is a need to develop a 3D personalized federated learning approach and conduct studies with real-world multi-institutional low-count PET data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated the low-count denoised results using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) computed against full-count reconstruction ground truth. For baseline comparisons, we first compared our results against previous federated reconstruction algorithms, including Federated Averaging (FedAvg, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>), Federated Learning with Proximal Term (FedProx, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>), Federated Learning with Local Batch Normalization (FedBN, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>), Specificity-Preserving Federated Learning (FedSP, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>), and Personalized Federated Learning with Hypernetwork (FedHyper, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>). For a fair comparison, all the methods used an identical reconstruction/denoising network, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We also compared our FedFTN against two types of locally trained models, including local single models and local unified models. For each local single model, an FTN-modulated denoising network was trained using one single low-count level data at one specific institution. On the other hand, the local unified models are also based on FTN-modulated denoising networks, but all three low-count levels’ data at a specific institution are used as training data. Furthermore, we also performed ablative studies on federated transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, where FedFTN are further fine-tuned using local data for site adaption.</p>

During the site adaptation with fine tuning on local data, we used a reduced learning rate of <math id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2e-5" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.cmml">e</mi></mrow><mo id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml">5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1b"><apply id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1"><minus id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2"><times id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2">2</cn><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3">𝑒</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1.1.3">5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.6.m6.1c">2e-5</annotation></semantics></math> and trained the FedFTN models using the local dataset for <math id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1a"><mn id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m7.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> epochs, and the batch size was also set to <math id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1a"><mn id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml">3</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1.1">3</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.8.m8.1c">3</annotation></semantics></math> with ’on-the-fly’ data augmentation.

The lowest low-count level denoised results from each institution were visualized for comparison. As we can see, since only less than 5% count was used, the original images (1st row) suffer from high noise and image artifacts. While the locally trained models can reduce the noise and recover the general structure, the detail recovery was still not ideal. For example, the 5% low-count denoised image from the locally trained model at Institution #1 created additional artifacts at the intersection between the liver and kidney. The 2% low-count denoised images from the locally trained models at Institution #2 and Institution #3 suffered from heavy blurring on important regions, such as the hypermetabolic lesions in the zoomed boxes. The quantitative comparisons were summarized in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We reported quantitative results for all available low-count levels for the three institutions. Similar to the observation from the visualizations, all the original PET images suffered from low SNR, resulting in low PSNR and NMSE values. Taking Institution #1 as an example, we can see the locally trained unified model, i.e. the FTN-modulated Denoising Network, was able to improve the PSNR from 20.46 to 26.02 for the 5% low-count PET. Please note that the local unified model is the network shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that is trained locally with the local site’s low-count level as an additional input. Using the FedFTN, we can further improve the PSNR from 26.02 to 27.24 with statistical significance. Similar observations on improvement over the locally trained models can be found for other low-count levels at Institution #1 and other institutions.

<p id="S4.p2.13" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> presented qualitative comparisons of low-count PET denoised images using different federated methods. For each institution, we showed one patient example for each low-count level, and all low-count levels are visualized. At Institution #1, all three low-count levels’ denoised images suffered from low SNR, with the noise level increasing as the dose level decreases. While previous FL methods can improve the image quality by suppressing the noise, the detail recovery was still suboptimal. For instance, for the 5% low-count level, the bone marrows in the spine were heavily blurred by the previous methods, whereas FedFTN showed much sharper spine, demonstrating the best consistency with the ground truth full-count reconstruction. Additionally, for the 10% low-count level, a strong false positive signal was visible in the spine from the original low-count reconstruction, and previous methods failed to suppress it, which may lead to misdiagnosis. In contrast, using FedFTN, we can suppress this false positive signal and provided a high-quality image that best matches the ground truth. At Institution #2, for the 2% low-count level, a false positive of cardiac defect was visible from the original low-count reconstruction. While previous methods can suppress the noise, this false positive defect signal cannot be fully removed, particularly for FedSP. In contrast, FedFTN demonstrated significantly better performance in false positive defect removal and the most consistent cardiac shape as compared to the ground truth. Similarly, for the 5% low-count level, FedFTN better recovered the signal of the aorta wall than previous methods. We observe similar results in the patient examples from Institution #3, where FedFTN can provide better image quality as compared to previous methods. The corresponding quantitative comparisons were summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. As mentioned previously, the original low-count reconstructions from all three institutions suffered from poor image quality, where the PSNR values were all lower than <math id="S4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="21.00" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">21.00</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1">21.00</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">21.00</annotation></semantics></math> at the lowest low-count levels for all three institutions. By deploying previous federate learning methods, as compared to the locally trained models (Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Fig. 3 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), we can see that these previous FL methods can already improve the low-count image quality across all institutions at all low-count levels.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we developed a novel personalized federated learning approach, called FedFTN, for multi-institutional low-count PET denoising. Specifically, we proposed to use a deep Feature Transformation Network (FTN) that is kept at the local institutions and takes the low-count level as input, to transform the intermediate feature outputs from the globally shared denoising network. There are several key advantages of this design. First of all, with different FTNs modulating the denoising network features at different local sites, we can personalize the denoising network, adapting to different low-count PET data with different distributions caused by differences in scanners, pre-/post-processing protocols, etc. Second, unlike previous personalized FL modules for image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, MRI synthesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and 2D SVCT reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> that use mapper sub-network directly generate scalars for feature map channel-wise multiplication and addition, our FTN first squeezes the feature map into a latent representation and fuse with the site and subject-specific latent vector before re-excitation. In Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we found our FedFTN can provide better reconstruction performance than FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> which also uses a locally kept module but generates normalization parameters for direct feature map affine transformation. Third, each institution often has multiple low-count protocols, thus requiring the denoising network to be able to adapt to inputs with different low-count levels. Instead of blindly inputting the original low-count reconstruction into the network without the knowledge of the low-count level, the FTN-modulated denoising network takes the information of the low-count level as additional input, thus enabling dose-level-aware denoising. Please also note that because individual FTN network is kept locally at each institution, the institution can define its own low-count levels. The sites do not need to share the exact same set of levels and no information about the low-count level is shared between institutions. Even though it is possible that better performance could be achieved if different sites share identical and matched low counts, having identical low counts across different sites based on different scanners, different injection protocols, and different processing/reconstruction protocols, may not be easily realizable in real-world FL scenarios. Lastly, we also proposed a Global Weight Constraint (GWC) loss that regularizes the denoising network parameters not to have strong deviation over the aggregated parameter during the training at local sites, helping stabilize the federated learning process, and thus improving the final personalized denoising performance at each site.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We collected large-scale real-world low-count PET data from three different institutions in the U.S.A., Europe, and China, to validate our method. From our experimental results, we demonstrated the feasibility of using our FedFTN for collaborative training without sharing data, while enabling personalized low-count PET denoising at different institutions. First, as we can observe from Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Fig. 3 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, even though training a denoising model from scratch using local data with limited diversity can generate reasonable denoising performance and potentially avoid domain shift issues, our FedFTN can provide significantly better denoising results. For example, as shown in the last row of Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our FedFTN demonstrated superior PSNR and NMSE values as compared to the locally trained models across all the low-count levels at all the institutions. This is mainly due to the fact that the FedFTN utilizes all the institutional data with a wider spectrum of data diversity for collaborative learning while using the FTN modulation to mitigate the domain shift issues. Second, as we can see from Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, our method generating personalized FTN-modulated denoising networks for individual institutions can consistently outperform previous FL reconstruction methods that either only produce one global model (FedAvg) or deploy personalize FL strategies (FedSP and FedHyper). Using an identical backbone reconstruction/denoising network, our FedFTN achieved the best image quality over all the previous FL baselines, in terms of both PSNR and NMSE with statistical significance, as reported in the second last row of Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Further fine-tuning the personalized denoising models from FedFTN with local data slightly boosted the performance. In addition, we found that adding the Global Weight Constraint (GWC) loss helped stabilize the FedFTN and improved the image quality at all low-count levels at all institutions, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Fig. 7 ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The presented work also has limitations with several potential improvements that are the subjects of our future studies. First, our study only considered three institutions and all with <sup id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_sup">18</sup>F-FDG tracer. While there are other PET tracers that could be used for specific applications, <sup id="S5.p3.1.2" class="ltx_sup">18</sup>F-FDG is still the most commonly used PET tracer in clinical practice and thus is the primary focus of our study. Furthermore, our FedFTN framework can be flexibly adjusted to different numbers of institutions, and potentially adapted to multi-tracer PET scenarios. Specifically, we could incorporate the tracer type, as well as other dose and patient information, as additional inputs to the FTN, which would also allow the FTN to transform the features in the denoising network depending on the input tracer type. In fact, we believe that including more diverse tracer types with expanded training data with more diverse data representation would potentially further improve our performance. In this work, we have already shown that we can use FTN to adapt and unify those different low-count distributions. However, we believe expanding to include multi-tracer multi-institutional data is an important future direction to validate any conclusion. Second, we only evaluated the overall image quality based on image quality metrics, i.e. PSNR/NMSE/SSIM, which use full-count PET as ground truth. The difference between our FL method and locally trained baselines is in the order of 1-2 dB PSNR which implies a significant image quality improvement with our FL strategy as compared to the local training strategy, which can be observed from Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Fig. 3 ‣ 3.5 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Methods ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. While the image quality metrics improvements from our FedFTN as compared to the prior SOTA FL methods is in smaller magnitude, the image quality improvements are reflected on more detailed regions, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedFTN: Personalized Federated Learning with Deep Feature Transformation Network for Multi-institutional Low-count PET Denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. We believe this kind of improvement could potentially lead to more accurate disease quantification, e.g. lesion radiomic, cardiac function, etc. However, how will such improvement over the prior SOTA FL method be reflected in clinically relevant tasks is an important direction for our following clinical investigation. Given PET has extensive clinical applications in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, our future work also includes evaluations of how the denoised image impacts the downstream tasks, such as the impacts on staging and therapy response, and human experts’ evaluations on these clinical tasks. Lastly, for a fair comparison and to demonstrate the idea, we performed all our experiments using a simple UNet as the backbone denoising network. However, our method could be adapted with more advanced restoration network structures. For instance, we could use more advanced network designs, such as cascade-based, transformer-based, and multistage-based reconstruction networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, in our FedFTN. Specifically, we can use FTN to transform and modulate the intermediate features in these networks, thus enabling personalized FL with these networks. Deploying these networks in our FedFTN could potentially further improve our performance and will also be an important direction for our future studies.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work proposes an innovative personalized federated learning method, named FedFTN, for multi-institutional low-count PET denoising. Our method utilizes a deep feature transformation network to generate a personalized low-count PET denoising model for each institution by modulating a globally shared denoising network. During the federated learning process, the FTN remains at the local institutions and is used to transform intermediate feature outputs from the shared denoising network, thus enabling personalized FL denoising. We utilized a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET data from three medical centers located across three continents to validate our method. Our experimental results showed that the FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET denoised images, outperforming previous baseline FL methods across all low-count levels at all three institutions. We believe our proposed methods could potentially be adapted to other deep learning-based medical imaging challenges where collaborative training without data sharing is needed to improve the medical image quality.</p>
