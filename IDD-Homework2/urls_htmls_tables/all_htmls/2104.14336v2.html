<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Current tasks and methods in Document Understanding aims to process documents as single elements. However, documents are usually organized in collections (historical records, purchase invoices), that provide context useful for their interpretation.
To address this problem, we introduce Document Collection Visual Question Answering (DocCVQA) a new dataset and related task, where questions are posed over a whole collection of document images and the goal is not only to provide the answer to the given question, but also to retrieve the set of documents that contain the information needed to infer the answer. Along with the dataset we propose a new evaluation metric and baselines which provide further insights to the new dataset and task.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Documents are essential for humans since they have been used to store knowledge and information over the history. For this reason there has been a strong research effort on improving the machine understanding of documents. The research field of Document Analysis and Recognition (DAR) aims at the automatic extraction of information presented on paper, initially addressed to human comprehension. Some of the most widely known applications of DAR involve processing office documents by recognizing text <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, tables and forms layout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, mathematical expressions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and visual information like figures and graphics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. However, even though all these research fields have progressed immensely during the last decades, they have been agnostic to the end purpose they can be used for. Moreover, despite the fact that document collections are as ancient as documents themselves, the research in this scope has been limited to document retrieval by lexical content in word spotting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, blind to the semantics and ignoring the task of extracting higher level information from those collections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, over the past few years Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been one of the major relevant tasks as a link between vision and language. Even though the works of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> start considering text in VQA by requiring the methods to read the text in the images to answer the questions, they constrained the problem to natural scenes. It was <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> who first introduced VQA on documents. However, none of those previous works consider the image collection perspective, neither from real scenes nor documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, we present Document Collection Visual Question Answering (DocCVQA) as a step towards better understanding document collections and going beyond word spotting. The objective of DocCVQA is to extract information from a document image collection by asking questions and expecting the methods to provide the answers. Nevertheless, to ensure that those answers have been inferred using the documents that contain the necessary information, the methods must also provide the IDs of the documents used to obtain the answer in the form of a confidence list as answer evidence.
Hence, we design this task as a retrieval-answering task, for which the methods should be trained initially on other datasets and consequently, we pose only a set of 20 questions over this document collection. In addition, most of the answers in this task are actually a set of words extracted from different documents for which the order is not relevant, as we can observe in the question example in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Document Collection Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Therefore, we define a new evaluation metric based on the Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) to evaluate the answering performance of the methods in this task. Finally, we propose two baseline methods from very different perspectives which provide some insights on this task and dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Document understanding has been largely investigated within the document analysis community with the final goal of automatically extracting relevant information from documents. Most works have focused on structured or semi-structured documents such as forms, invoices, receipts, passports or ID cards, e-mails, contracts, etc. Earlier works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> were based on a predefined set of rules that required the definition of specific templates for each new type of document. Later on, learning-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> allowed to automatically classify the type of document and identify relevant fields of information without predefined templates. Recent advances on deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> leverage natural language processing, visual feature extraction and graph-based representations in order to have a more global view of the document that take into account word semantics and visual layout in the process of information extraction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All these methods mainly focus on extracting key-value pairs, following a bottom-up approach, from the document features to the relevant semantic information. The task proposed in this work takes a different top-down approach, using the visual question answering paradigm, where the goal drives the search of information in the document.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Providing tools for searching relevant information in large collections of documents has been the focus of document retrieval. Most works have addressed this task from the perspective of word spotting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, i.e., searching for specific query words in the document collection without relying on explicit noisy OCR. Current state-of-the-art on word spotting is based on similarity search in an common embedding space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> where both the query string and word images can be projected using deep networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> In order to search for the whole collection, these representations are combined with standard deep learning architectures for object detection in order to find all instances of a given word in the document <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Word spotting only allows to search for the specific instances of a given word in the collection without taking into account the semantic context where that word appears. On the contrary, the task proposed in this work does not aim to find specific isolated words, but to make a semantic retrieval of documents based on the query question.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task where given an image and a natural language question about that image, the objective is to provide an accurate natural language answer. It was initially introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proposed the first large scale dataset for this task. All the images from those works are real scenes and the questions mainly refer to objects present in the images. Nonetheless, the field became very popular and several new datasets were released exploring new challenges like ST-VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and TextVQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which were the first datasets that considered the text in the scene. In the former dataset, the answers are always contained within the text found in the image while the latter requires to read the text, but the answer might not be a direct transcription of the recognized text. The incorporation of text in VQA posed two main challenges. First, the number of classes as possible answers grew exponentially and second, the methods had to deal with a lot of out of vocabulary (OOV) words both as answers or as input recognized text. To address the problem of OOV words, embeddings such as Fasttext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and PHOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> became more popular, while in order to predict an answer, along with the standard fixed vocabulary with the most common answers a copy mechanism was introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> which allowed to propose an OCR token as an answer. Later <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> changed the classification output to a decoder that outputs a word from the fixed vocabulary or from the recognized text at each timestep, and provided more flexibility in complex and longer answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Concerning documents, FigureQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and DVQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> focused on complex figures and data representation like different kinds of charts and plots by proposing synthetic datasets and corresponding questions and answers over those figures. More recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed DocVQA, the first VQA dataset over document images, where the questions also refer to figures, forms or tables but also text in complex layouts. Along with the dataset they proposed some baselines based on NLP and scene text VQA models. In this sense, we go a step further extending this work for document collections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, one of the most relevant works for this paper is ISVQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> where the questions are asked over a small set of images which consist of different perspectives of the same scene. Notice that even though the set up might seem similar, the methods to tackle this dataset and the one we propose are very different. For ISVQA all the images share the same context, which implies that finding some information in one of the images can be useful for the other images in the set. In addition, the image sets are always small sets of <math id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math> images, in contrast to the whole collection of DocCVQA and finally, the images are about real scenes which don’t even consider the text. As an example, the baselines they propose are based on the HME-VideoQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and standard VQA methods stitching all the images, or the images features.

We got the documents from this source for various reasons. First, it’s a live repository that is updated periodically and therefore, the dataset can be increased in size in the future if it’s considered necessary or beneficial for the research. In addition, it contains a type of documents in terms of layout and content that makes sense and can be interesting to reason about an entire collection. Moreover, along with the documents, they provide their transcriptions in the form of CSV files which allows us to pose a set of questions and get their answers without the costly process of annotation. From the original collection of document images, we discarded all the multi-page documents and documents for which the transcriptions were partially missing or ambiguous. Thus, all documents that were finally included in the dataset were sourced from the same document template, the US Candidate Registration form, with slight design differences due to changes over the time. However, these documents still pose some challenges since the proposed methods will need to understand its complex layout, as well as handwritten and typewritten text at the same time.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Considering that DocCVQA dataset is set up as a retrieval-answering task and documents are relatively similar we pose only a set of <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math> natural language questions over this collection. To gather the questions and answers, we first analyzed which are the most important fields in the document form in terms of complexity (numbers, dates, candidate’s names, checkboxes and different form field layouts) and variability (see section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Statistics and Analysis ‣ 3 DocCVQA Dataset ‣ Document Collection Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>). We also defined different types of constraints for the types of questions since limiting the questions to find a specific value would place this in a standard word spotting scenario. Thus, we defined different constraints depending on the type of field related to the question: for dates, the questions will refer to the document before, after and between specific dates, or specific years. For other textual fields the questions refer to documents with specific values (candidates from party <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math>), to documents that do not contain specific values (candidates which do not represent the party <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math>), or that contains a value from a set of possibilities (candidates from parties <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">Q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1.1">𝑄</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.m5.1c">Q</annotation></semantics></math> or <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="R" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">R</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝑅</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.6.m6.1c">R</annotation></semantics></math>). For checkboxes we defined constraints regarding if a value is checked or not. Finally, according to the fields and constraints defined we posed the questions in natural language referring to the whole collection, and asking for particular values instead of the document itself. We provide the full list of questions in the test set in table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.1.2 Questions and Answers: ‣ 3.1 Data Collection ‣ 3 DocCVQA Dataset ‣ Document Collection Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Given the low variability of the documents layout, we ensured that in the test set there were questions which refer to document form fields or that had some constraints that were not seen in the sample set.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ultimate goal of this task is the extraction of information from a collection of documents. However, as previously demonstrated, and especially in unbalanced datasets, models can learn that specific answers are more common to specific questions. One of the clearest cases is the answer <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Yes</em>, to questions that are answered with <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Yes</em> or <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">No</em>. To prevent this, we not only evaluate the answer to the question, but also if the answer has been reasoned from the document that contains the information to answer the question, which we consider as evidence. Therefore, we have two different evaluations, one for the evidence which is based on retrieval performance, and the other for the answer, based on text VQA performance.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section describes the two baselines that are employed in the experiments. Both baselines breakdown the task into two different stages. First, they rank the documents according to the confidence of containing the information to answer a given a question and then, they get the answers from the documents with the highest confidence. The first baseline combines methods from the word spotting and NLP Question Answering fields to retrieve the relevant documents and answer the questions. We name this baseline as <em id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Text spotting + QA</em>. In contrast, the second baseline is an ad-hoc method specially designed for this task and data, which consist on extracting the information from the documents and map it in the format of key-value relations. In this sense it represents the collection similar as databases do, for which we name this baseline as <em id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Database</em>. These baselines allows to appreciate the performance of two very different approaches.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.12" class="ltx_p">Once the documents are ranked, to answer the given questions we make use of BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> question answering model. BERT is a task agnostic language representation based on transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> that can be afterwards used in other downstream tasks. In our case, we use extractive question answering BERT models which consist on predicting the answer as a text span from a context, usually a passage or paragraph by predicting the start and end indices on that context. Nonetheless, there is no such context in the DocCVQA documents that encompasses all the textual information. Therefore, we follow the approach of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to build this context by serializing the recognized OCR tokens on the document images to a single string separated by spaces following a top-left to bottom-right order.

For that, we first run a commercial OCR over the document collection, extracting not only the recognized text, but also the key-value relationship between the field names and their values, including checkboxes. This is followed by a process to correct possible OCR recognition errors for the fields with low variability (field names, parties and reporting options) and normalize all the dates by parsing them to the same format. Finally, we map the key-value pairs into a database like data structure. At the time of answering a question, the fields in the query are compared with those in the stored records.

Then, BERT can’t answer because it lacks of a document collection point of view, and moreover, since it is an extractive QA method, it would require to have a <em id="S5.SS2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">No</em> in the document surrounded with some context that could help to identify that word as an answer. On the other hand, the database method fails because of its logical structure. If there is a relevant document for that question, it will find the field for which the query is asking for, or will answer ’<em id="S5.SS2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Yes</em>’ if the question is a Yes/No type.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work introduces a new and challenging task to both the VQA and DAR research fields. We presented the DocCVQA that aims to provide a new perspective to Document understanding and highlight the importance and difficulty of contemplating a whole collection of documents. We have shown the performance of two different approaches. On one hand, a text spotting with an extractive QA baseline that, although it has lower generic performance it is more generic and could achieve similar performance in other types of documents. And on the other hand, a baseline that represents the documents by their key-value relations that despite achieving quite good performance, is still far from being perfect and because of its design is very limited and can’t generalize at all when processing other types of documents. In this regard, we believe that the next steps are to propose a method that can reason about the whole collection in a single stage, being able to provide the answer and the positive evidences.</p>
