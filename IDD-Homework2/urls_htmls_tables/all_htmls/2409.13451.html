<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) leverages client-server communications to train global models on decentralized data. However, communication noise or errors can impair model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel FL algorithm that enhances robustness against communication noise while also reducing communication load. We derive the proposed algorithm through solving the weighted least-squares (WLS) regression problem as an illustrative example. We first frame WLS regression as a distributed convex optimization problem over a federated network employing random scheduling for improved communication efficiency. We then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively solve this problem. To counteract the detrimental effects of cumulative communication noise, we introduce a key modification by eliminating the dual variable and implementing a new local model update at each participating client. This subtle yet effective change results in using a single noisy global model update at each client instead of two, improving robustness against additive communication noise. Furthermore, we incorporate another modification enabling clients to continue local updates even when not selected by the server, leading to substantial performance improvements. Our theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of our algorithm in both mean and the mean-square senses, even when the server communicates with a random subset of clients over noisy links at each iteration. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The
proliferation of smart devices has led to the widespread availability of big data, which has the potential to enhance decision-making processes for end-users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, leveraging this data effectively presents several challenges, particularly in terms of privacy, security, and resource management. A key issue is that data is typically stored locally on edge devices, and transferring it to a central server or the cloud raises privacy and security concerns and can lead to excessive resource utilization. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising machine learning paradigm that addresses these challenges by enabling edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their locally stored data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. FL faces two significant challenges: data heterogeneity and device heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Data heterogeneity arises from the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data or imbalances among client datasets used in training the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Diversity in data distribution across participants can significantly impact model convergence and performance. Additionally, device heterogeneity refers to the disparities in storage capacity, energy resources, computational power, and communication capabilities among participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Variations in device characteristics can affect the efficiency and fairness of the FL process. Despite these challenges, FL emerges as a promising approach for managing heterogeneous data and devices in distributed learning settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FL literature frequently employs the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as a standard benchmark. FedAvg begins with the server broadcasting its aggregated global model to a randomly chosen subset of clients, typically over a wireless network. These clients then perform local training to refine their local models before sending the updates back to the server. The server aggregates these local models into a new global model, repeating this process until a specific convergence criterion is met. Building on FedAvg, numerous FL approaches have been developed to address various challenges inherent in distributed learning. These challenges include preserving privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, mitigating Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and improving communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However, many of these approaches assume ideal communication links, overlooking the potential impact of communication errors or noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In practical deployments, the communication channels between clients and the server are often subject to noise, which can degrade model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, various techniques have been proposed to enhance the robustness of FL models in the presence of communication noise. While some studies focus on the uplink noise and neglect the downlink noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, others account for noise in both communication directions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world scenarios, communication channels between the central server and edge devices are often imperfect, leading to noise in both uplink and downlink <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. This leads to the server receiving noisy versions of local model updates and clients obtaining noisy versions of the aggregated model from the server, potentially compromising the quality of the learned model. The presence of noise in communication channels can severely impair the performance of gradient-descent-based FL algorithms. Several solutions have been proposed to address this challenge. One approach involves utilizing a new loss function that incorporates the first-order derivative as a regularizer to counteract additive noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Additionally, resilience to downlink noise can be enhanced through techniques such as digital transmission with quantization and channel coding or analog downlink transmission using uncoded global model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> propose that controlling the scale of the communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can help tolerate noise while maintaining the convergence rate of FedAvg.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, the authors utilize precoding and scaling during transmissions to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy channels, ensuring the convergence of their algorithm. While these methods show promise, they typically require additional resources on the client side. This requirement can pose challenges in practical FL applications, where clients may operate under constraints such as limited power, energy, memory, or computational capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, it is shown that the algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> can achieve convergence even in the presence of additive communication noise. This robustness positions ADMM as a promising candidate for FL applications where communication noise is a concern. However, conventional ADMM algorithms require the participation of all clients in each FL round, which may be impractical in real-world FL scenarios due to resource constraints and the heterogeneity of edge devices. Therefore, there is a pressing need for developing ADMM-based FL algorithms that can effectively cope with communication noise with minimal additional communication or computational overhead.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new communication-efficient FL algorithm based on ADMM that is resilient against communication noise and errors in both uplink and downlink channels, without imposing any additional computational burden on participating clients. Using the weighted least-squares (WLS) regression problem as a motivating example, we develop our proposed FL algorithm by iteratively solving an aptly formulated distributed convex optimization problem via ADMM. To enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate random client scheduling, where the server selects a subset of clients during each FL iteration. To alleviate the adverse effects of link noise, we communicate a linear combination of the last two global model updates and eliminate the dual model parameters at all participating edge devices. Moreover, we enable clients to continue performing model updates, even when not scheduled for participation in any FL round. We evaluate the proposed algorithm and showcase its effectiveness through comprehensive theoretical performance analysis and numerical simulations.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Weighted least-squares (WLS) regression is a natural extension of least-squares regression that offers significant advantages in various signal processing applications, such as power system state estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, position estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and image noise reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. In WLS, different observations are assigned weights based on their reliability, allowing the model to more accurately reflect the data when observations vary in quality. This approach can effectively mitigate the impact of less reliable data, resulting in more precise and dependable models.</p>

However, in FL, clients often have limited communication and computational resources. Therefore, requiring participation of all clients in every global update round can lead to significant drawbacks, such as prolonged convergence time or excessive resource utilization.

This new approach can enhance overall performance without introducing any additional communication overhead or imposing any notable increase in computational load of clients or the server, as we will demonstrate later. To implement this approach, clients store the most recent global model estimate received from the server, while the server holds the latest local model estimates received from all clients. Consequently, clients continually update their local models using the most recent global model estimate, and the server updates the global model using the latest local updates from all clients, irrespective of random scheduling.

In the second subsection, we evaluate the performance of RERCE-Fed with continual local updates and compare it with RERCE-Fed without continual local updates.
In the last subsection, we corroborate our theoretical findings by demonstrating mean convergence and comparing theoretical predictions with simulation results, confirming the accuracy of our theoretical expression for MSE of RERCE-Fed.</p>

From these figures, we observe that RERCE-Fed with continual local updates consistently exhibits robustness against communication noise, even when only a small subset of clients participate in every FL round. In addition, RERCE-Fed with continual local updates significantly outperforms its counterpart without continual local updates in all considered scenarios. These results indicate that allowing clients to continually update their local models, even when not selected by the server, leads to a substantial improvement in steady-state NMSE without adversely impacting the convergence rate. Additionally, as anticipated, increasing the link noise variance results in performance degradation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed RERCE-Fed, an FL algorithm designed to effectively reduce communication load while maintaining robustness against additive communication noise or errors. By employing ADMM to solve the WLS problem, we introduced a new local model update at the clients. This innovative solution mitigates the effects of communication noise without imposing additional computational burden on clients. Furthermore, we improved the communication efficiency by randomly selecting a subset of clients to participate in each learning round. To further optimize performance, we enabled non-selected clients to continue with their local updates, resulting in a modified version of RERCE-Fed. Our theoretical analysis confirmed the convergence of RERCE-Fed in both mean and mean-square sense, even with random client scheduling and communication over noisy communication links. In addition, we derived a closed-form expression for the steady-state MSE of the RERCE-Fed algorithm. Comprehensive numerical analysis substantiated our theoretical findings and confirmed the accuracy of our theoretical predictions.
As a future extension of this work, we will investigate the impact of various adversarial attacks on the performance of RERCE-Fed, including model poisoning, data poisoning, and label poisoning attacks.</p>
