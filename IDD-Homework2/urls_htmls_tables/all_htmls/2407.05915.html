<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The rapid proliferation of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in a transformative era of data-driven connectivity across various domains. However, this exponential growth has raised pressing concerns about environmental sustainability and data privacy. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces One-shot Federated Learning (OSFL), an innovative paradigm that harmonizes sustainability and machine learning within IoT ecosystems. OSFL revolutionizes the traditional Federated Learning (FL) workflow by condensing multiple iterative communication rounds into a single operation, thus significantly reducing energy consumption, communication overhead, and latency. This breakthrough is coupled with the strategic integration of generative learning techniques, ensuring robust data privacy while promoting efficient knowledge sharing among IoT devices. By curtailing resource utilization, OSFL aligns seamlessly with the vision of green and sustainable IoT, effectively extending device lifespans and mitigating their environmental footprint. Our research underscores the transformative potential of OSFL, poised to reshape the landscape of IoT applications across domains such as energy-efficient smart cities and groundbreaking healthcare solutions. This contribution marks a pivotal step towards a more responsible, sustainable, and technologically advanced future.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data localized and private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The workflow begins with the initialization of a global model, followed by device participation, where decentralized clients perform local training on their data, compute model updates, and securely aggregate them on a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. This iterative process refines the global model over multiple rounds, monitored by evaluation metrics until the desired performance is achieved. <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">FL’s privacy-preserving and distributed nature makes it suitable for applications like green and sustainable IoT, healthcare, and federated edge computing, addressing data privacy concerns while enabling machine learning in diverse and resource-constrained environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

Specifically, we present an innovative framework termed Federated Generative Learning (FGL) which was proposed by Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. FGL harnesses the robust capabilities of generative models, including Stable Diffusion and GPT-4V, to generate high-fidelity surrogate training data directly on the server. This process is guided by prompts provided by individual clients. In a concrete sense, our method streamlines the workflow by having each client upload only their respective prompts, linked to their local training data. Once all prompts are gathered from the clients, the server orchestrates prompt aggregation and subsequently synthesizes a premium-quality surrogate training dataset. This dataset can then be employed to train a global model.</span> By leveraging generative learning techniques and minimizing communication rounds, this approach aims to address the challenges of energy efficiency, scalability, and privacy in IoT networks. <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The subsequent sections of this paper will delve into the technical details, experiments, and practical implementations of OSFL, illustrating its potential to usher in a greener and more sustainable era for IoT applications.</span> This paper’s primary contributions are as follows:</p>

Traditional FL workflows require multiple rounds of communication to exchange model updates and converge towards a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. In contrast, OSFL condenses this multi-round process into a one-shot operation, reducing the overall energy footprint of IoT devices. This reduction in energy consumption is of paramount importance in green and sustainable IoT, where power-efficient operations are essential to mitigate environmental impact and prolong the lifespan of battery-operated devices.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The introduction of OSFL underscores the importance of striking a balance between sustainability and model performance in IoT applications. While reducing energy consumption and communication overhead are critical sustainability objectives, it is equally crucial to ensure that model quality and learning performance are not compromised. OSFL addresses this challenge by optimizing generative learning processes to create high-quality synthetic updates that faithfully represent the knowledge of participating devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Through this balance, OSFL presents a compelling solution for green and sustainable IoT, enabling energy-efficient machine learning while maintaining or even improving the quality of learned models. Recent research has further pushed the boundaries of FL efficiency by exploring one-shot learning techniques. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> demonstrated the feasibility of one-shot learning, enabling models to generalize from limited data instances. While these advancements primarily targeted traditional FL, they underscored the potential for a more streamlined and efficient FL workflow. Our work bridges the gap between communication-efficient FL and one-shot learning, introducing OSFL as a novel approach that synergizes these concepts to maximize sustainability in IoT while minimizing the environmental footprint of machine learning operations.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">T2IGMs typically consist of two primary components: an encoder-decoder architecture and a generative model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The encoder processes the textual input, converting it into a latent representation that captures the semantics of the text. The decoder, on the other hand, takes this latent representation and generates a corresponding image. Often, the generative model incorporates GAN-based techniques to ensure the generated images are both visually convincing and semantically faithful to the input text <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The synergy between these components enables T2IGMs to understand and translate textual descriptions into high-quality images. The training of a T2IGM involves a GAN-like setup with a discriminator and generator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. The discriminator tries to distinguish between real images and images generated from text, while the generator aims to generate images that fool the discriminator.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, we utilize two distinct local prompt generation strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, both of which are visually depicted in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Overview of Federated Generative Learning Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Correction: Harnessing Federated Generative Learning for Green and Sustainable Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The first strategy is designed to characterize classes within the local data, while the second focuses on characterizing individual entities present in the local datasets. These two prompt generation strategies share a common objective: to extract essential features from the local training data, facilitating the server-side generation model’s ability to effectively collaborate in data synthesis. Importantly, it is essential to emphasize that these strategies do not entail the transmission of model updates or gradients.

<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Crucially, training data synthesis in FGL operates without the exchange of model updates or gradients, a distinctive departure from traditional FL.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One-shot learning streamlines the knowledge transfer process within FGL. In traditional FL, multiple rounds of model updates are exchanged between edge devices and the central server, often leading to substantial communication overhead. In contrast, one-shot learning condenses this into a singular communication round, dramatically reducing the amount of data transferred. The core objective of one-shot updating is to enrich the global generative model with collective insights from edge devices. These insights are encapsulated in the prompts generated by edge devices, which offer descriptive information about their local datasets. The central server leverages this valuable input to enhance the capabilities of the generative model.

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fashion-MNIST.</span> Fashion-MNIST is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It serves as an alternative to the traditional MNIST dataset but offers more challenging and diverse tasks. F-MNIST consists of 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items, such as clothing and accessories, categorized into ten different classes. These classes include items like T-shirts, dresses, sneakers, handbags, and more. F-MNIST is often used for benchmarking and evaluating machine learning algorithms and models, especially for tasks related to image classification, feature extraction, and deep learning.</p>

It contains 60,000 color images, divided into ten classes, with each class representing a different object category. Each image in CIFAR-10 has a resolution of 32x32 pixels and is labeled with one of the following categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck. CIFAR-10 is widely used for research in image classification, object recognition, and deep learning due to its diversity and complexity.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CIFAR-100.</span> CIFAR-100 is an extension of the CIFAR-10 dataset and is designed for more fine-grained image classification tasks. It also consists of 60,000 images, but this time they are divided into 100 different classes. Each class represents a more specific object category, making CIFAR-100 suitable for tasks where distinguishing between closely related objects is required. The dataset includes objects like different types of birds, insects, and vehicles. CIFAR-100 is commonly used in research for tasks involving fine-grained object recognition, hierarchical classification, and model evaluation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data Partition.</span> In FGL, data partitioning plays a pivotal role in shaping the training process. Setting up IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data involves ensuring that each edge device’s data is representative of the entire dataset and follows the same data distribution. To achieve this, the dataset is divided equally or approximately equally among the edge devices, ensuring that each device receives a balanced representation of data classes and characteristics. On the other hand, setting up non-IID (Non-Independent and Non-Identically Distributed) data in FGL involves recognizing the diversity of data among edge devices. Each device may possess a unique data distribution (we employ the Dirichlet distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>), varying class proportions, or distinct data characteristics.</p>

This architecture is utilized for classification tasks involving the F-MNIST datasets. In contrast, for classification tasks related to the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we utilize the AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> model.</p>

In this scenario, we consider a total of 5 clients, all actively participating in the communication process. For both centralized training and federated learning, we configure the local learning rate to be 0.01 and employ the SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9. During the FedAvg training phase, individual clients conduct local updates for 5 epochs, and the communication round is set to span 200 iterations. On the other hand, centralized training entails a total of 120 rounds of iterations as part of its training regimen.</p>

Specifically, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the performance of FGL is 5.67% higher than that of FedAvg. In addition, we can also find that the system performance of FGL is comparable to the baselines on the CIFAR-100 data set.

1) FGL’s system performance is generally better than the baseline and does not require multiple rounds of communication, thanks to the powerful learning ability of the basic model. 2) Non-IID data setting does not significantly affect the system performance of FGL. 3) The OSFL method does not affect system performance.</span>

Since FGL utilizes one shot learning and updating methods, we expect that the communication overhead of FGL is much smaller than that of baselines.

Note that since centralized training does not involve communication protocols it is not compared here. Furthermore, we note that the running time of FGL is approximately 1/2 of the baseline solutions, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Numerical Results ‣ 5 Experomental Results ‣ Correction: Harnessing Federated Generative Learning for Green and Sustainable Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Numerical Results ‣ 5 Experomental Results ‣ Correction: Harnessing Federated Generative Learning for Green and Sustainable Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

1) FGL benefits from the one-shot learning and updating method, which greatly reduces its communication overhead. 2) Since FGL no longer requires local training, its running efficiency has also been accelerated. 3) In resource-constrained IoT environments, FGL can achieve a perfect trade-off between model utility and resource energy consumption.</span>

As mentioned above, this article designs two local prompt strategies. We evaluate these strategies by comparing the system performance under different prompt strategies.

We found that using a more precise entity-level prompt strategy leads to higher accuracy, for example, reaching 68.62% on CIFAR-10 compared with the accuracy of the class-level prompt strategy. This result clearly highlights the importance of considering more detailed entity-level information in prompt strategy design. However, the entity-level prompt policy involves specific real image information, which may cause potential privacy issues, and we leave it as future work.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Privacy has been a paramount concern in IoT ecosystems, and our One-shot FGL approach offers a pragmatic solution. By allowing edge devices to share abstract prompts instead of raw data, we strike a balance between data utility and privacy preservation. This design mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access while enabling the collaborative generation of synthetic data. The localization of data aggregation further fortifies privacy, as prompts, not individual data samples, are aggregated. The privacy-centric nature of FGL aligns with the ethical use of data and user expectations for data confidentiality in the IoT era.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sustainability is at the core of our approach. By reducing the need for extensive data transmission and centralization, FGL contributes to the ecological sustainability of IoT systems. The conservation of energy and bandwidth resources not only supports environmental goals but also enhances the operational longevity of IoT devices. FGL’s ability to generate high-quality synthetic data from decentralized sources promotes sustainable practices by minimizing the environmental footprint of data transfer and storage. This integration of sustainability and privacy-consciousness positions FGL as a pioneering approach in building responsible and eco-friendly IoT ecosystems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While our approach shows promise, several challenges and future directions warrant consideration. One key challenge is optimizing the generative model’s performance while working with decentralized and diverse data sources. Developing advanced generative techniques that can adapt to various data distributions across edge devices is essential. Additionally, research in federated learning orchestration and model aggregation techniques needs further exploration to maximize the utility of FGL.</p>

The adaptability stems from the ability to employ different generation models for prompt generation corresponding to diverse task data. For instance, the VisualGLM model can be employed to generate prompts and subsequently facilitate learning from video data. The scalability of the framework across different tasks is confirmed, underscoring the importance of task scalability in a learning framework.</span></p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have introduced and delved into the concept of OSFL as an innovative approach aimed at addressing the dual imperatives of sustainability and privacy within the realm of the IoT. OSFL, characterized by its reduction of communication rounds and optimization for energy efficiency through generative learning, holds significant promise for reshaping the landscape of machine learning in IoT ecosystems. <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Our research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of OSFL in achieving sustainable IoT operations. By condensing the traditional federated learning process into a single communication round, OSFL substantially mitigates energy consumption, communication overhead, and latency. Moreover, the integration of generative learning techniques ensures the preservation of data privacy, even as knowledge is efficiently shared among IoT devices. OSFL stands as a novel and environmentally conscious paradigm that aligns with the global imperative to reduce the environmental footprint of technology while facilitating advanced machine learning capabilities.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Looking ahead, the potential applications of OSFL in green and sustainable IoT are expansive. From optimizing energy consumption in smart cities to enhancing environmental monitoring in remote regions, OSFL can empower IoT devices to learn and collaborate effectively while minimizing their environmental impact. Furthermore, OSFL’s ability to balance sustainability and model performance opens doors to new opportunities in domains such as healthcare, agriculture, and industrial automation, where resource-efficient machine learning is crucial. In conclusion, OSFL not only underscores our commitment to responsible and sustainable technology development but also offers a transformative pathway to a greener and more intelligent IoT ecosystem.</p>
