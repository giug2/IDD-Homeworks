<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), a popular decentralized and privacy-preserving machine learning (FL) framework, has received extensive research attention in recent years. The majority of existing works focus on supervised learning (SL) problems where it is assumed that clients carry labeled datasets while the server has no data. However, in realistic scenarios, clients are often unable to label their data due to the lack of expertise and motivation while the server may host a small amount of labeled data. How to reasonably utilize the server labeled data and the clients’ unlabeled data is thus of paramount practical importance. In this paper, we propose a new FL algorithm, called FedSEAL, to solve this Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) problem. Our algorithm utilizes self-ensemble learning and complementary negative learning to enhance both the accuracy and the efficiency of clients’ unsupervised learning on unlabeled data, and orchestrates the model training on both the server side and the clients’ side. Our experimental results on various datasets in the SSFL setting validate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art SSFL methods by a large margin.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">End user devices, such as personal computers, smart phones, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are generating an unprecedented amount of data nowadays. With the recent breakthrough in machine learning (ML), this data has a tremendous potential of powering a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language understanding and recommender systems. However, utilizing this data to train ML models in a centralized way is increasingly challenged by the rising privacy concerns associated with uploading personal data to a central location such as the cloud. As such, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> has recently emerged as a new decentralized ML paradigm, where clients (i.e., user devices) collaboratively train an ML model with the coordination of a server while keeping all the training data at the clients. Specifically, a typical FL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> works in an iterative manner where, in each iteration, each client downloads the current global model from the server, updates the global model using its local data to obtain a local model and uploads the local model to the server, and the server aggregates the received local models to produce a new global model. The algorithm then terminates after a sufficient number of iterations upon convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL has seen a huge literature devoted to it in recent years, the majority of which focuses on supervised learning (SL) problems. Particularly, it is assumed that each client carries a training dataset with ground-truth labels whereas the server has no data and only participates as a model parameter aggregater. While this assumption may be meaningful for some applications and certainly simplifies the problem, it fails to hold in many real-world scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. On the one hand, client data is usually unlabeled due to the lack of expertise and motivation of the client to label its own data. On the other hand, the server, which is operated by the entity aiming to build the ML model, often possesses a small amount of data that is labeled by domain experts. This labeled server dataset, albeit much smaller in size than the client datasets, reflects the overall client data distribution to some extent. Although one can always train an ML model based on only the labeled server data, the model performance will be significantly limited by the size of the server dataset and hence, how to utilize the massive unlabeled client data in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner to boost the model performance is of paramount practical importance. This is the so-called Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While FL and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have been extensively studied individually, addressing SSFL is not straightforward and the key challenge lies in performing SSL in a decentralized setting. In conventional SSL, because the labeled and unlabeled datasets are located in the same place, training is a single process that works simultaneously on both types of data. This allows the learning algorithm to conveniently balance between supervised learning and unsupervised learning, which is especially crucial in early learning rounds when unsupervised learning can contain a lot of errors. Such a balance is typically achieved by assigning a small weight on the unsupervised learning loss function in the early learning rounds and gradually increasing the weight value as the model accuracy improves. However, in SSFL, supervised learning and unsupervised learning have to be separate and alternated processes due to the disjoint locations of the labeled and unlabeled datasets. Thus, controlling the errors incurred in the unsupervised learning step becomes much more difficult yet critical since otherwise errors can quickly accumulate and propagate, eventually leading to the failure of learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although previous works addressing the SSFL problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> perform better than the simple combination of FL methods and SSL methods, their performance is only on par with or even worse than utilizing only the server labeled data, which is a natural first benchmark that any SSFL algorithm must beat to demonstrate the benefits of utilizing client unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a new SSFL algorithm, called FedSEAL, to effectively orchestrate supervised learning and unsupervised learning in SSFL, and show that utilizing client unlabeled data in a federated manner can indeed improve learning. FedSEAL is based on two primary ideas, namely <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">s</span>elf-<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">e</span>nsemble learning and neg<span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">a</span>tive <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">l</span>earning, hence the name. With self-ensemble learning, the clients can construct a high-quality positive filtered dataset to train the local model based on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. This is achieved by building a historical model ensemble and calculating server-gauged confidence score thresholds to produce more accurate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data of clients. With negative learning, the clients can expand the dataset usable for unsupervised learning and stabilize positive learning especially in the initial learning rounds. This is achieved by assigning complementary labels to unlabeled data instances and constructing a second filtered dataset for training the local models by the clients. We empirically validate the effectiveness of FedSEAL on three classic datasets, namely CIFAR10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Fasion-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and SVNH <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, in the SSFL setting. The results show that, in a wide variety of settings, FedSEAL outperforms the state-of-the-art SSFL algorithms by a large margin.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a decentralized ML framework which trains a global model at the server without sharing the clients’ local data. There has been a huge literature in recent years since the proposal of the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, tackling the core challenges of FL including improving communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, handling data and system heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and enhancing model privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

Besides the conventional one-server multiple-clients architecture, new FL system architectures have also been proposed and studied, e.g., hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and clustered FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The majority of existing works on FL, however, focus on the supervised learning problem. Only a small number of recent works investigated the more realistic SSFL problem, which will be discussed in more detail shortly.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SSL is a classic ML problem which aims to learn an ML model using both labeled data and unlabeled data. Typically, the size of labeled data is considered much smaller than that of unlabeled data. Although various SSL algorithms have been developed, most of them are built on two techniques, namely pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization. Pseudo-labeling was first proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which utilizes prior information extracted from the labeled data to predict the class distribution of the unlabeled data. It then converts the class distribution into hard labels to calculate the entropy loss based on which the prediction model is updated. The biggest issue of pseudo-labeling is that the model can be overconfident about its prediction because training utilizes the pseudo-labels produced by the model itself. Once the model assigns wrong labels to the unlabeled data and the wrong labels are used in training, it will become very difficult to correct the model and hence the model performance will keep degrading as training continues. Consistency regularization is an alternative SSL approach, which is based on the assumption that the model should output similar predictions for different augmented versions of the same input. This idea was employed in many popular SSL algorithms, such as <math id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pi" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">π</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\pi</annotation></semantics></math>-model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Temporal Ensemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Mean Teacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Recently, UDA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and MixMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> apply strong data augmentation approaches such as AutoAugment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and RandAugment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to further improve the learning performance. Combining both pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, FixMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> achieves the state-of-the-art SSL performance. FedSEAL also utilizes pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to facilitate the learning at the clients, although it studies the SSFL problem.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The practical importance of SSFL has been recognized recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and started to attract more and more research attention. Two SSFL settings are commonly considered: in the label-at-client setting, both labeled data and unlabeled data are located at the clients while the server has no data; in the label-at-server setting, the labeled data is available only at the server. For example, SSFL has been studied in applications such as traffic sign recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and COVID-19 medical imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in the label-at-client setting, and human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> in the label-at-server setting on time series data. Our paper focuses on image classification in the label-at-server setting, which has a wide range of application scenarios. In this regard, SemiFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> alternates the server supervised training and clients unsupervised training to enhance pseudo label quality. FedMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is a state-of-the-art SSFL algorithm and has been commonly adopted as a benchmark. It utilizes inter-client consistency loss and disjoint learning to improve upon naive combinations of FL and SSL approaches. Following FedMatch, several works, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, demonstrated better SSFL performance than FedMatch. Unfortunately, the comparison was not properly conducted due to a parameter configuration mistakenly stated in the paper of FedMatch<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We have communicated with the authors of FedMatch to confirm this mistake.</span></span></span>. Importantly, the performance of these works, including FedMatch, is only comparable to and sometimes even worse than the straightforward method that performs supervised learning on only the server labeled data by disregarding all client unlabeled data. We believe that this is an important baseline that provides the lower-bound performance for any effective SSFL algorithm. We demonstrate that FedSEAL outperforms existing works as well as the lower-bound baseline by a large margin, verifying its ability to effectively utilize client unlabeled data to boost the learning performance. More detailed discussions are deferred to the Experiment section.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Like a typical FL algorithm, FedSEAL works in an iterative manner and involves local/global model exchange between the server and the clients. Different from traditional supervised FL, however, the server will also participate in the training process by updating the global model using its labeled dataset. Specifically, FedSEAL involves four steps in each FL round:</p>

As a result, the relatively large number of incorrect pseudo-labels produced by the suboptimal global model in the early rounds can significantly damage local training and degrade the obtained local model performance as well as the global model performance after aggregation. In fact, the errors will accumulate and propagate across learning rounds, eventually leading to the failure of learning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The root cause of the above problem is that the global model in the early rounds can be overconfident about its prediction result, even though it has not reached convergence. This “stunbornness” will be further reinforced if the wrong pseudo-labels are used to train the local models, thereby causing even worse prediction performance in the future rounds. To address this issue, we propose to generate the pseudo-labels using not just a single global model in the current round but many historical global models from the previous rounds. In this way, we hope that the “stunborness” of a single model can be softened by the collective opinion of multiple models. We call this method <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">self-ensemble learning</span> because the multiple models are all obtained in the same learning process, albeit from different rounds. The idea of using historical model ensembles was also used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, whose purpose is to derive smoother predictive distributions and reduce the risk of overconfidence class assignment on out-of-distribution data by individual models.</p>

Thus, by assigning complementary labels, namely classes other than the true class, to the instances, more information can be used to update the local model.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first compare FedSEAL with methods that naively combine existing FL and SSL methods, namely FedAvg-FixMatch and FedAvg-UDA. This set of experiments are conducted on Fashion-MNIST. For FedSEAL, the initial values of the server learning rate and the client learning rate are set as 0.001 with a decay rate 0.995 and local momentum 0.9, and the complementary threshold <math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">θ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\theta</annotation></semantics></math> for negative learning is 0.05. For FixMatch and UDA, the fixed confidence score threshold is 0.9. Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.2 Experiment Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedSEAL: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning with Self-Ensemble Learning and Negative Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> reports the test accuracy of various methods for both the IID and non-IID cases. As expected, FedAvg-SL achieves the highest accuracy because the client instances are assumed to be labeled, thereby setting the (unrealizable) upper-bound performance. FedSEAL outperforms the realizable lower-bound baseline Server-SL as well as the naive combination methods by a large margin of 4-5%, demonstrating its ability of effectively utilizing clients’ unlabeled data. We note that the test accuracy of FedAvg-FixMatch and FedAvg-UDA is only comparable to or even worse than that of Server-SL, suggesting that a naive combination of SSL and FL does not deliver a satisfactory performance in SSFL problems. This is because many unlabeled data instances can receive incorrect pseudo labels. Using a higher confidence score threshold may improve the pseudo-labeling correct rate but results in much less unlabeled data to be utilized. In the extreme case when the threshold is set to 1, both FedAvg-FixMatch and FedAvg-UDA essentially degenerates to Server-FL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We further compare FedSEAL with state-of-the-art SSFL methods, namely FedMatch and FedRGD. This set of experiments are conducted on CIFAR10, and the setup is exactly the same as that used in FedMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Under this same setup, the numbers reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> can be used for a direct comparison. However, during the actual execution of FedMatch by ourselves, we found that these numbers are incorrect due to a wrong parameter configuration, and the actual performance of FedMatch is better than what was reported<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>The paper mistakenly stated that 5000 labeled instances were used for the server, but in fact only 1000 labeled instances were used in the experiment, resulting in a lower accuracy.

We label the corrected numbers as <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedMatch (corrected)</span>. Since FedMatch does not use data augmentation at the server, we further consider an additional baseline that removes data augmentation from Server-SL, labeled as <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Server-SL w/o DA</span>, for a fair comparison.

Since the lower-bound baseline Server-SL was not used in the comparison for the label-at-server setting in the papers of FedMatch and FedRGD, the results are a little surprising: both FedMatch FedRGD underperform their respective lower-bound baselines (a fair comparison would be FedMatch v.s. Server-SL w/o DA, and FedRGD v.s. Server-SL). By contrast, our FedSEAL algorithm outperforms Server-SL by a large margin, re-confirming its ability of effectively utilizing clients’ unlabeled data to boost the learning performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a promising ML framework to address the challenges of decentralized datasets and data privacy. However, research on SSFL has not been on par with its SL counterpart. This paper proposed FedSEAL, a new SSFL algorithm, to orchestrate supervised learning at the server and unsupervised learning at the clients. Through extensive experimental validation, FedSEAL is shown to outperform existing SSFL approaches by a large margin, demonstrating the possibility of using unlabeled data to improve learning even in the FL setting. As future work, we plan to investigate how to transfer the techniques adopted by FedSEAL to problems other than image classification, and strive to understand its performance limit from a theoretical perspective.</p>

It also has a validation dataset of 200 instances. There are 10 clients and each client has 1200 unlabeled instances for training. The test dataset has 300 instances for each client. In the IID scenario, each client has 120 randomly extracted unlabeled instances per class whereas in the non-IID scenario, we utilize the Dirichlet function which is typically utilized to simulate the level of non-IID in federated learning. We use ResNet-18 as the backbone model. Other The training hyper-parameters setting of Fashion-MNIST is shown in Table <a href="#A1.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ A.1 Experimental Details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ FedSEAL: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning with Self-Ensemble Learning and Negative Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

There are 100 clients and each client has 490 unlabeled instances. In the IID scenario, each client has 49 randomly extracted unlabeled instances per class whereas in the non-IID scenario, to make a fair comparison, the class distribution is exact same as FedMatch. In each FL round, 5 clients are selected to participate in FL. The only difference is that FedMatch applies a learning rate 0.001 and decays it by a factor of 3 if there is no improvement in the validation loss for 5 consecutive epochs. FedSEAL utilizes the same initial learning rate 0.001 and decays it by 0.995 in each round.

The reason for this performance degradation is as follows. Sharpening predictions has been proven beneficial in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Soft labeling would further soften the class probability distributions in addition to self-ensemble learning. With hard labels, pseudo-labeling is better aligned with cross-entropy minimization, thereby improving the model traning performance.</p>
