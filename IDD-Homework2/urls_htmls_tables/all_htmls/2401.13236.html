<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has attracted vivid attention as a privacy-preserving distributed learning framework. In this work, we focus on cross-silo FL, where clients become the model owners after training and are only concerned about the model’s generalization performance on their local data. Due to the data heterogeneity issue, asking all the clients to join a single FL training process may result in model performance degradation. To investigate the effectiveness of collaboration, we first derive a generalization bound for each client when collaborating with others or when training independently. We show that the generalization performance of a client can be improved only by collaborating with other clients that have more training data and similar data distribution. Our analysis allows us to formulate a client utility maximization problem by partitioning clients into multiple collaborating groups.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), a distributed model training paradigm, has recently received much attention due to its benefits in preserving data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In an FL system, a central server coordinates multiple clients with private data for training deep learning (DL) models.
Specifically, participating clients collaborate to find a global model that achieves satisfactory performance on all clients’ data by sharing model updates instead of training data.
During the FL training process, clients receive a global model from the server and optimize it based on the local data. After local training, clients upload the accumulated model updates to the server for aggregation. The server in turn updates the global model using the aggregated model updates and sends it back to clients for the next epoch training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the types of clients, FL can be classified into cross-device and cross-silo settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In this work, we focus on cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> where clients are typically companies or organizations (e.g., banks or hospitals) and become the model owners after FL training.
These clients, which normally have sufficient computation resources, are expected to be continuously available throughout the training process. However, they are usually self-interested and are only concerned about the generalization performance on their local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, each client wants to learn a model that can generalize well on its local distribution.
In practice, some powerful clients with sufficient training data can achieve a good generalization performance with independent training, thus having limited or no incentive to collaborate with others.
Meanwhile, the data among clients are naturally not independent and identically distributed (non-IID); this is known to severely degrade the training performance of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Hence, participating in FL may be a suboptimal choice for some clients.
On the other hand, clients with a limited amount of data may prefer collaborating with others to benefit from their training data. Nevertheless, they also tend to exclude the diverged gradients uploaded by clients with disparate data distribution. As such, training a single global model by incorporating all clients cannot suit their requirements. Given the above considerations, our paper aims to address the challenge of how to collaborate among clients under the FL framework, which demands a flexible collaboration plan.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There have been a few attempts to improve the utility of collaboration in FL.
A recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed to only incorporate the clients that find the global model appealing in FL while allowing others to train independently.
Nevertheless, those independent clients, which have data distributions different from most clients, may not enjoy satisfactory performance by making a binary decision of whether to participate in FL or not.
To remedy the deficiency of a single global model, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduce multiple global models to FL system to the FL system.
Specifically, they cluster all clients into several groups, and the clients in the same group cooperatively train a global model.
The clustering criterion is tailored to minimize the training error of clients, which, however, is not sufficient to guarantee good performance on unseen or new data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
To enhance clients’ generalization performance, the design of an appropriate metric for partitioning clients remains an unresolved challenge.
Besides, determining the number of groups without additional knowledge of local data distribution is a notoriously challenging problem.
As a more general consideration, some studies resort to game theory to formulate the client partition problem as a hedonic game without fixing the number of groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
However, these works focus on the theoretical aspects of this game, e.g., stability and equilibrium, and they do not provide any practical or efficient algorithm to solve the problem.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigate how to design the collaboration pattern of clients so as to maximize their generalization performance in a cross-silo FL system.

Our analytical results unveil that the generalization performance of a client can be improved by involving more training data samples yet excluding the collaborators with diverged data distribution.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce related approaches that consider the problem of collaboration patterns in FL with self-interested clients.
We note that personalization techniques, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, can be seen as orthogonal to our study, since these techniques can be employed to further enhance the model performance at clients after the collaboration design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fair collaboration in single-model FL.</span>
Considering the client requirements, Cho <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a training scheme named <em id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">MAXFL</em>, where each client participates in FL only if it finds the global model appealing, namely, if the global model yields a smaller training loss than a self-defined threshold.
This threshold is defined as the difference between the current global model and a local model optimized in an independent training process, which, however, introduces additional computation cost.
More importantly, the binary decision used in this work excludes the possibility that those independent clients may formulate a group to further improve their generalization performance.
Another stream of work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> aims to achieve fair model performance among clients by modifying the global training objective.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed to give a higher weight to the model updates from clients with lower training accuracy.
Nevertheless, these attempts still focus on the setup with a single global model, which limits the performance improvement for most clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Clustered federated learning.</span>
To satisfy different local objectives, clustered FL generates multiple global models by clustering clients into several groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
For example, an iterative clustering algorithm for FL named <em id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IFCA</em> was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where client group identity estimation and federated model training are carried out alternatively.
To estimate the group identity, clients are required to evaluate each global model on their local data to find the one achieving the minimal training loss.
However, this process incurs additional training cost that increases linearly with the number of groups.
More importantly, the clustering criterion in these works emphasizes the training loss but fails to reflect the generalization performance on the unseen data.
Furthermore, selecting the number of groups is known to be challenging as the server does not know local data distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Game theoretic approaches.</span>
As a more general formulation, one branch of studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> views the collaboration design of clients in FL as a hedonic game without fixing the number of groups and arranges the client partition to minimize their training errors.
These works are closely related to our consideration, but they mainly focus on the theoretical aspects by analyzing the optimality, stability, and equilibrium of solutions.
Although an optimal client partition was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, it is restricted to the mean estimation problem. A practical algorithm that can efficiently arrange client partitions in general DL setups is still lacking.
Moreover, other game theory-based works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> assume that clients are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns of limited computation resources or privacy leakage.
Therefore, the central server, whose objective is to obtain a satisfactory global model, gives clients sufficient rewards to encourage their participation in FL.
Nevertheless, these works focus on improving a single global model and may become suboptimal in terms of local test error since they ignore the performance requirements of clients.
In contrast to previous work, we propose an efficient algorithm to design the collaboration pattern such that all clients can achieve satisfactory generalization performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that clients have various data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and thus some clients’ data may differ significantly from others.
However, under strict privacy protection, the local data distribution is only visible to the client itself <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
If the process of joining a group is performed arbitrarily, clients may suffer from performance degradation due to the data heterogeneity issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

To solve this problem, we propose to use the gradient divergence to approximate the divergence of data distribution.
This is inspired by the gradient matching methods in domain generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and dataset condensation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, where close gradient directions indicate similar data distributions.

In HCCT, the training process is divided into <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> training epochs.

After partition, clients train current models based on their local data.
If a group has only one client, this client performs independent training.
Otherwise, the clients in this group participate in collaborative training, with the server aggregating their model gradients.
We summarize the training process of HCCT in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 5 Hierarchical Clustering-based Collaborative Training Scheme ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and detail the client partition step as follows.</p>

Specifically, each group in HCCT can be viewed as “a micro FL system” that contains a set of clients.
Thus, we can employ any personalization technique to enhance the clients’ performance in a group.
For example, the clients may only collaborate to train the feature extractor of a model and keep the classifier as a personalization layer locally.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will analyze the proposed HCCT scheme to prove its convergence and observe the effect of client similarity.
To begin with, we make some commonly adopted assumptions on the local loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
It is worth noting that we do not assume any convexity of loss functions in this section. In other words, the following results hold for general non-convex loss functions.
For simplicity, we denote the local empirical loss function of client <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math> by:</p>

To show such data heterogeneity, previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> made assumptions on the difference between local and global training objectives.
Different from these works, we aim to investigate the collaboration among clients and thus make a more precise assumption on the gradient similarity among clients as follows.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We are now to derive the convergence of the HCCT in the following theorem.
Previous works in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> upper bound the expected squared gradient norm of the global loss function.
Compared with these works, the clients in cross-silo FL have local training objectives and are not concerned about the global objective.
Therefore, a better option is to verify the convergence of the algorithm using the sum of local gradients <math id="S6.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}}\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla

<div id="S7.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first compare the generalization performance under different training schemes in three training tasks.
Table <a href="#S7.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 7.1 Setup ‣ 7 Simulation Results ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> shows the average local test error of all clients after a given number of training epochs.
We observe that in the Digit training task, HCCT achieves minimal test error among all training schemes.
This is because HCCT finds an appropriate collaboration pattern for all clients which enhances their generalization performance by involving more training data while excluding gradients from clients with dissimilar data distribution.
In comparison, clients in independent training cannot achieve a good generalization performance because of limited training data, while global training suffers from poor convergence speed caused by heterogeneous data.
Moreover, other baseline schemes including MAXFL, FedFA, and FLSC, induce larger test errors at clients, since they cannot identify the intrinsic cluster structure of clients.
In addition, we find that in IFCA all clients may find the same model appealing and tend to join in that group, which degrades its generalization performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the FMNIST training task, HCCT and global training have similar test errors, and they outperform other baselines.
Given the IID data at clients, a global collaboration incorporates the maximum training data samples and significantly improves the generalization performance of the model.
However, clients in the CIFAR-10 task have heterogeneous data, and thus the global training scheme suffers from such non-IID issue.
In this case, it is preferable for clients to perform independent training, and HCCT also exhibits comparable test error to independent training.
These results evidence that HCCT can identify the most effective client collaboration pattern, including independent training and global training, to accommodate various scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To further compare different training schemes, we summarize the average, standard deviation, minimal, and maximal values of test errors at clients in the Digit training task in Table <a href="#S7.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 7.2 Performance Comparison ‣ 7 Simulation Results ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.
We see that in addition to achieving the lowest average test error, HCCT also notably reduces the test error of the worst-performing client, which verifies that clients with fewer training data samples can benefit from effective collaboration.
Meanwhile, the generalization performance of those clients with sufficient training data is also preserved, as the proposed utility function excludes clients with dissimilar data from its collaboration group.
Besides, it is worth noting that HCCT achieves a lower standard deviation than the baseline schemes, which shows that HCCT implicitly enhances fairness among clients, leading to similar generalization performance for all clients.</p>

Compared with the original results of HCCT, HCCT-P further reduces the test error of clients.
However, since clients already found a proper collaboration pattern with others, the improvement is relatively limited.
A better combination with existing personalization techniques is left as future works.</p>

To demonstrate the additional advantage of HCCT, we present the learning curves in Fig. <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 7.3 Compatibility of HCCT ‣ 7 Simulation Results ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> where 10 clients begin training and 0, 1, and 2 new clients join in training every 10 iterations.
Upon the arrival of a new client, its allocation to a specific group is determined based on the utility evaluation according to (<a href="#S5.E15" title="In 5 Hierarchical Clustering-based Collaborative Training Scheme ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>) and (<a href="#S5.E16" title="In 5 Hierarchical Clustering-based Collaborative Training Scheme ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>). This immediate integration of the new client’s data into the training process is evident from the observed increase in accuracy. Notably, the integration of additional clients over time contributes to a progressive reduction in the final training error.
This demonstrates the flexibility and efficiency of our framework in not only integrating new clients but also in utilizing their data to improve the overall model performance.</p>

In this study, we split the assigned data at each client into the training data and test data according to different ratios, where a larger ratio means that a client has more training data samples but less test data.

From the results in Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.4 Effect of System Parameters ‣ 7 Simulation Results ‣ How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we observe that in this scenario the optimal number of groups to achieve the minimal test error is <math id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS4.p2.3.m3.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math>.
Notably, the maximal utility is also achieved when clients are divided into <math id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS4.p2.4.m4.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> groups.
A plausible explanation is that each group consists of clients sharing the same dataset.
This implies that the utility function can effectively reflect the client’s requirement of improving the generalization performance, such that the minimal test error can be achieved when the utility is maximized.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we tackled the challenge of optimizing the client collaboration pattern in order to maximize the generalization performance in cross-silo FL. We derived the generalization bound for clients in various collaboration cases and then formulated the client utility maximization problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we proposed HCCT, a hierarchical clustering-based collaborative training scheme, in which clients are partitioned into different non-overlapping groups without the need to initially decide the number of groups. We also proved the convergence of HCCT for general loss functions. The effectiveness of HCCT is further verified via extensive simulations in different scenarios and datasets.
For future work, it is worth exploring personalization techniques in HCCT to further improve the generation performance.</p>
