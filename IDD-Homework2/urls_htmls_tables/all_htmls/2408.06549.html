<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables devices to collaboratively train models without sharing their local data, ensuring user privacy and scalability. However, applying FL to real-world data presents challenges, particularly as most existing FL research focuses on unimodal data. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged to address these challenges, leveraging modality-specific encoder models to process diverse datasets. Current MFL methods often uniformly allocate computational frequencies across all modalities, which is inefficient for IoT devices with limited resources. In this paper, we propose FlexMod, a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in MFL by adaptively allocating training resources for each modality encoder based on their importance and training requirements. We employ prototype learning to assess the quality of modality encoders, use Shapley values to quantify the importance of each modality, and adopt the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method from deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of training resources. Our method prioritizes critical modalities, optimizing model performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of MFL models.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a distributed machine learning approach where clients collaborate to train a machine learning model by sharing model parameters. This decentralized learning model enables devices to train models collaboratively without sharing their local, private data. Existing FL works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have enhanced several aspects of this method, including user data privacy, scalability to new clients and datasets, and accelerated model convergence rates. Despite these strengths, practical challenges arise when applying FL to complex, real-world data, particularly as most existing FL research focuses on unimodal data. In practical FL applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, clients often comprise Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smartphones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), equipped with multimodal sensors capable of capturing diverse datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multimodal data, which often have varying data structures, present challenges for conventional FL methods designed for unimodal data, underscoring the need for approaches that can handle multimodal information, which is more reflective of real-world applications. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged in response to this need. A common approach in MFL involves employing a modality-specific encoder model for each type of data to extract features, reducing high-dimensional raw data to lower-dimensional feature representations. These features are then input into a header encoder, typically comprising deep neural network (DNN) layers with a softmax function for classification. The existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> in MFL have different focuses. Some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> develop methods to more effectively utilize multimodal data at the feature level to enhance prediction accuracy. Others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> address scenarios where certain modalities are missing from some clients, or where, despite the ability to process all modalities, limited communication resources restrict the upload of updates for selected modalities to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While there have been improvements in model performance, none of the existing MFL methods address the critical issue of computational resource allocation. Current MFL approaches uniformly distribute computational resources across all existing modalities’ training processes. However, in real-world applications, most clients are IoT devices with limited computational resources and constrained local training timeframes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Efficient management of these limited resources in each training round is essential for optimizing model performance. Moreover, in the MFL setting, data comes from various modalities, each with distinct structures and dimensions, which can be significantly large. The complexity of feature extraction varies across these modalities, necessitating different types of encoder models for each. This diversity in complexity has direct implications for training time and computational resource allocation. Allocating the same training frequencies to all modality-specific encoders leads to training inefficiencies.</p>

As expected, using both modalities to train the classification model results in the highest accuracy. However, the accuracy achieved by using data from only one modality differs depending on which modality is employed.

Training a single modality encoder is faster than training both modality encoders in parallel or sequentially. This suggests the feasibility of increasing the training frequencies for higher-priority modality encoders compared to the conventional strategy where both modalities must be trained simultaneously. Additionally, the training time for a single modality encoder varies across modalities as the encoder structures entail different complexities. Thus, allocating training resources to modality encoders must consider both the importance of the modality and its training complexity. Finally, training both modality encoders in parallel saves time compared to the sum of training times for the encoders separately or training both modality encoders sequentially. Therefore, if sufficient training resources are available, updating the encoders in parallel is still preferable.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">First</span>, we investigate the impact of each modality based on three factors: the quality of each trained modality encoder, the importance of each modality’s features in the final classification, and the time required for training each type of encoder. Specifically, we employ prototype learning to assess the training adequacy of each modality, where prototypes serve as a form of global prior knowledge. To evaluate the importance of each modality, we utilize Shapley values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to quantify their respective contributions to model performance.

However, these existing works focus on unimodal conditions. Our paper is the first attempt to optimize computational resource allocation in a multimodal federated learning setting.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While existing FL methods largely focus on unimodal applications, a significant number of real-world applications involve multimodal data streams. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> investigates FL using multi-sensory data and proposes a self-supervised learning approach to learn robust multimodal representations in FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> designs a multimodal FL framework using the cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposes FedMSplit, which addresses the issue of missing modalities in the multimodal setting. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> uses a contrastive representation-level ensemble to learn a larger server model from heterogeneous clients across multiple modalities. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduces FedMultimodal, an FL benchmark for multimodal applications. While these methods have led to improvements in model performance, none of the existing MFL methods address the critical issue of computational resource allocation. Current MFL approaches uniformly distribute computational resources across all existing modalities’ training processes. Our work aims to optimize this allocation to enhance overall training efficiency and performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.21" class="ltx_p">We assume that all clients have comparable computational capabilities, allowing them to conclude their training sessions in a nearly synchronous manner. This setting aligns with existing MFL frameworks, where each client communicates with the central server only after their local training. Training for each encoder may occur simultaneously or separately. As our motivation study reveals, the time spent training modality combinations is less than the sum of training the modalities separately.

While the allocation of training resources for modalities in MFL is similar to the client selection problem in classical FL—which has been effectively addressed by using deep reinforcement learning to select clients for training—this method cannot be directly applied to our context. The reason is that client selection is a binary decision: a client is either selected (i.e. 1) or not (i.e. 0), resulting in a relatively manageable action space for deep reinforcement learning applications.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge of adaptively allocating modality combination training resources effectively within each local training period, our proposed method, FlexMod, contains three main steps: 1. We quantify the factors of each modality combination that impact the resource allocation decision. 2. We utilize the determined modality combination factors to formulate an optimization problem for each local training epoch. 3. We provide the training orders of the modality combinations in each local epoch and offer corresponding theoretical analysis. In this section, we will introduce each step in detail.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to variations in data structures across different modalities, the corresponding modality encoders differ. Consequently, training difficulties also vary, naturally leading to the conclusion that encoders which are more challenging to train should receive greater attention. These encoders should be allocated more computational resources, allowing for more frequent training sessions within a single local training period compared to those required by simpler modality encoders. Therefore, the first element we consider involves assessing the quality of the modality encoder (i.e. how well the modality encoder has been trained) to impact the necessity and frequency of training.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A simplistic approach might be to estimate training progress based solely on the size of the encoder model, assuming that larger models progress more slowly and therefore require more resources. However, this method is rigid as it only assesses the difficulty of training modality encoders at the start and does not allow for adaptive reallocation of resources based on actual progress. Another intuitive method involves monitoring the differences, such as the L2 Norm, between consecutive updates of each encoder model. However, this approach is inequitable due to the structural differences between modality encoders. To address the challenge of quantifying training quality across differently structured modality encoders, we propose a solution inspired by prototype learning. Prototypes encapsulate the semantics of data within a given class.</p>

The rationale for this approach is that the distinctiveness of global prototypes reflects the effectiveness of the modality encoders. Specifically, the more distinguishable the global prototypes are for different classes within a modality, the more effectively the modality encoder can extract distinct features, indicating higher quality. Conversely, if the global prototypes for different classes within a modality overlap significantly, it suggests that the modality encoder requires further training to achieve optimal performance.</p>

Notably, the time cost of training modalities together is less than training each separately.

This aligns with the rationale that integrating modalities more comprehensively, rather than in isolation, enhances efficiency.</p>

The UCI-HAR dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is a well-established dataset for human activity recognition. It comprises data from 30 participants (average age: 24) performing six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down. These activities are recorded using smartphone sensors, specifically accelerometers and gyroscopes, which capture three-dimensional motion data. The data are sampled at a rate of 50 Hz, resulting in 128 readings per window per sensor axis.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing MFL methods often uniformly allocate computational frequencies across all modalities. In this paper, we propose FlexMod, a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in MFL by adaptively allocating training resources for each modality encoder based on their importance and training requirements. We employ prototype learning to assess the quality of modality encoders, use Shapley values to quantify the importance of each modality, and adopt the DDPG method from deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of training resources. Experimental results on three real-world datasets validate the efficiency of our proposed method. One limitation of this work is that we only consider the full participation scenario in the FL setting. Thus, a future research direction is to consider the client partial participation setting.</p>
