<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a privacy-preserving approach to train a global model at a central server by collaborating with wireless devices, each with its own local training data set. In this paper, we present a compressive sensing approach for federated learning over massive multiple-input multiple-output communication systems in which the central server equipped with a massive antenna array communicates with the wireless devices. One major challenge in system design is to reconstruct local gradient vectors accurately at the central server, which are computed-and-sent from the wireless devices. To overcome this challenge, we first establish a transmission strategy to construct sparse transmitted signals from the local gradient vectors at the devices. We then propose a compressive sensing algorithm enabling the server to iteratively find the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimate of the transmitted signal by exploiting its sparsity. We also derive an analytical threshold for the residual error at each iteration, to design the stopping criterion of the proposed algorithm. We show that for a sparse transmitted signal, the proposed algorithm requires less computationally complexity than LMMSE. Simulation results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms conventional linear beamforming approaches and reduces the performance gap between federated learning and centralized learning with perfect reconstruction.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning has attracted significant interest as a breakthrough for emerging applications of wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The fundamental idea of machine learning for wireless communications is to learn a model (e.g., input-output relation) based on large amounts of data and computing power. It has been demonstrated that the learned model can be exploited either to improve the performance of conventional model-based techniques (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>) or to describe an unknown input-output relation whose characterization was otherwise challenging due to mathematical intractability (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>). The most common and widely adopted form of machine learning is <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized learning</span> in which a central server equipped with sufficient storage and computing power has full access to the entire data set. Unfortunately, centralized learning is infeasible in many applications of wireless communications. The major reason is that data sets are usually generated at wireless devices, but transmitting them to the central server is highly limited by both the amount of radio resources and communication latency allowed in the applications.
Particularly, this problem becomes more severe as the data size and the model complexity increase. In addition, sending the data may not be allowed in privacy-sensitive applications such as social networking, e-health, and financial services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning has drawn increasing attention as a viable solution to overcome the limitations of centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, in which a global model at a central server is collaboratively trained by multiple devices each with its own local data set.
The major advantage of federated learning is a significant reduction in communication overhead as the devices only send an updated model instead of the whole data set. In addition, this approach preserves the privacy of the devices because the data is kept where it is generated while a central server has no direct access to the local data sets. Distributed machine learning also provides similar advantages, but federated learning focuses on a more practical setting which may include unbalanced and non-identically-distributed data sets, unreliable communication, and massively distributed data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Thanks to the advantages and the practicality of federated learning, it has been adopted as a key enabler for emerging applications of wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, federated learning is applied to learn the statistical properties of vehicular users in wireless vehicular networks. Another example is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> which applies federated learning to learn the locations and orientations of the users in wireless virtual reality networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There also exist recent studies that seek to enable and optimize federated learning over wireless communication systems by considering the physical characteristics of wireless channels

A device scheduling problem is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> based on various scheduling criteria, while a joint resource allocation and user scheduling problem is tackled in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Transmission and reception techniques for federated learning are developed for a simple Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and for a fading MAC in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. A transmission technique for the fading MAC is also proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> jointly with a device scheduling method.
To improve the robustness against channel fading and noise effects in wireless environments, the use of multiple antennas at a central server and/or wireless devices is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
The effect of multiple antennas on the performance of federated learning is investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> under the assumption that receive beamforming is employed by a multi-antenna central server.
In this work, the use of the receive beamforming is shown to be an effective approach when the server is equipped with a sufficiently large number of antennas.
Under the same assumption as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, training time optimization for federated learning is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Transmit and/or receive beamforming for over-the-air computation are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> which can be utilized to reduce latency in federated learning.
Specifically, joint optimization for device selection and receive beamforming is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, while joint design of transmit and receive beamforming is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
The common limitation of the existing works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, however, is that they only consider linear beamforming approaches to design the reception technique at the multi-antenna server.
Unfortunately, such linear beamforming approach is not optimal in terms of the estimation performance at the server in general; thereby, further investigation on the reception technique is still needed to maximize the estimation performance at the multi-antenna central server in federated learning over wireless communication systems.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we study federated learning over massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, in which a global model is trained through collaboration of multiple wireless devices, each with its own local training data set, with a central server equipped with a massive number of antennas.
One of the challenges in system design is to reconstruct local gradient vectors accurately at the central server, which are computed-and-sent from the wireless devices.
Our key observation to overcome this challenge is that the local gradient vectors are likely to be sparse in the considered federated learning framework.
Motivated by this observation, we present a compressive sensing approach that exploits the sparsity of the local gradient vectors, to enable efficient reconstruction of them at the central server.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to establish a compressive sensing approach for a multi-antenna central server in federated learning, to exploit the sparsity in a spatial-device domain.
Note that the existing works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> also consider a compressive sensing approach, but for a single-antenna server, while exploiting the sparsity in a different domain.

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We establish a transmission strategy to construct sparse transmitted signals from the local gradient vectors at the wireless devices.
The basic idea of this strategy is to permute the local gradient vectors using different patterns across the wireless devices.
The major advantage of our transmission strategy is that when the local gradient vectors are sparse, only a small subset of devices simultaneously transmit non-zero gradient elements at each radio resource, which results in a sparse transmitted signal.
Using simulations, we demonstrate that the use of our transmission strategy significantly improves the sparsity of the transmitted signal in the considered federated learning framework.</p>

In the proposed algorithm, to properly determine the LMMSE estimate at the server, we establish a statistical model for the transmitted signal based on a large-scale approximation and a statistical feature obtained from our transmission strategy.
We also derive an analytical threshold for the residual error at each iteration, to design the stopping criterion of the proposed algorithm.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed compressive sensing algorithm with our transmission strategy efficiently reduces the performance gap between federated learning and centralized learning with perfect reconstruction, when the size of the mini-batch employed at each device is relatively small.</p>

We then compare the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm with those of the linear beamforming methods. Our key finding is that the proposed algorithm requires less complexity than the LMMSE method when the transmitted signal is sparse, which is verified through both analytical and numerical results. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms linear beamforming methods in terms of the classification accuracy of federated learning, using simulations.</p>

The main causes of this mismatch are 1) inter-user interference caused by simultaneous transmission of multiple devices, 2) channel fading naturally occurred in wireless channels, and 3) noise signal in RF chain.
This mismatch may harm both the learning accuracy and the convergence rate of federated learning as will be demonstrated in Sec. V.
Therefore, it is essential to reduce this mismatch by developing a proper reception technique at the central server that enables accurate estimation of the local gradient vectors.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a compressive sensing approach that allows the central server to efficiently reconstruct the local gradient vectors sent from the wireless devices. To this end, we first discuss the sparsity of the local gradient vectors and then establish a transmission strategy to construct sparse transmitted signals from the local gradient vectors at the wireless devices. Based on this strategy, we propose a compressive sensing algorithm enabling the central server to estimate the transmitted signal by exploiting its sparsity.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our compressive sensing approach is motivated by the sparsity of the local gradient vectors in federated learning over wireless communication systems.
First of all, the average magnitudes of gradient elements are expected to reduce as a training algorithm (e.g., gradient descent algorithm) proceeds;
thereby, the number of zero gradient elements may increase over time.
Particularly this number is much larger when employing a ReLU activation function
since the gradient of the ReLU function is zero for any negative-valued input.
We have also observed that the number of zero gradient elements are likely to increase as the size of the mini-batch training data samples utilized to compute the local gradient vector at each device decreases.
The rationale behind this observation is that zero gradient elements computed for each training data sample would be associated with a significantly different subset of weights across different samples.
This observation is particularly relevant for federated learning over wireless communications
since the size of the mini-batch samples at wireless device (e.g., smartphone or IoT device) is expected to be relatively small due to a limited computing power and/or a stringent latency constraint.
All these observations imply that the local gradient vectors are likely to be sparse in federated learning over practical communication systems.
It is also noticeable that transmitted signals whose magnitudes are much smaller than the noise level of a communication system can be treated as zero signals
since they have negligible impacts on the performance of federated learning.
Meanwhile, only a few of the largest gradient elements will remain large in the transmission signal at the wireless devices
since each device normalizes the local gradient vector before its transmission, as can be seen in (<a href="#S2.E2" title="In II System Model ‣ A Compressive Sensing Approach for Federated Learning over Massive MIMO Communication Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
These observations imply that even if the local gradient vectors may not be exactly sparse in certain cases (e.g., during the initial training iterations),
an approximate sparsity can still be observed at the central server.</p>

measurement with noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Based on this intuition, we propose a compressive sensing algorithm that iteratively finds the LMMSE estimate of the transmitted signal by exploiting its sparsity.
This algorithm can be separately applied to the received signal at each radio resource of each uplink phase.

Motivated by this, we derive a condition that determines the case to which the current support set belongs. To achieve this goal, we characterize the expected value of the norm squared of the residual vector in these three cases. The result of this characterization is given in the following proposition:</p>

Using this strategy, the overall computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is further reduced.
As can be seen in Algorithm 1, the proposed algorithm is a greedy algorithm whose optimality is not guaranteed in general. Nevertheless, the numerical results in Sec. V illustrate that the performance gap between federated learning with the proposed algorithm and centralized learning with perfect reconstruction is marginal under certain scenarios.</p>

Characterizing the statistical behavior of the gradient vector is very challenging in the most learning tasks, which is due to the randomness and the heterogeneity of real-world data. For this reason, the statistics of the transmitted signal are generally unknown at the server, and consequently, the LMMSE method suffers from performance degradation caused by imperfect statistical information. Another limitation of the LMMSE method is that it requires the computation of a <math id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2M\times 2M" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">M</mi></mrow><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">M</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1"><times id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2"><times id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2"><times id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.2">2</cn><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.2.3">𝑀</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.3">2</cn></apply><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑀</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.3.m3.1c">2M\times 2M</annotation></semantics></math> matrix inversion to determine the beamforming matrix in (<a href="#S4.E37" title="In IV-B Limitation of Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) ‣ IV Comparison to A Linear Beamforming Approach ‣ A Compressive Sensing Approach for Federated Learning over Massive MIMO Communication Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">37</span></a>).

The above result implies that if the size of the true support set is much smaller than the number of devices, the complexity reduction achieved by the proposed algorithm over the LMMSE method increases with the number of the server’s antennas. Therefore, in federated learning over the massive MIMO system, the proposed algorithm is significantly more beneficial than the LMMSE method in terms of the computational complexity. Note that although the MRC method achieves the lowest complexity among three methods, it suffers from a performance degradation as will be shown in Sec. <a href="#S5" title="V Simulation Results ‣ A Compressive Sensing Approach for Federated Learning over Massive MIMO Communication Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.</p>

Considering this fact, we adopt a relatively simple neural-network structure as it is more suitable for the use in practical communication systems whose radio resources are scarce. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a more complex neural network (e.g., a convolutional neural network) to further improve the classification accuracy.</span></span></span>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented a compressive sensing approach for federated learning over a massive MIMO system, which allows a central server to efficiently reconstruct local gradient vectors sent from wireless devices.
In particular, motivated by the sparsity of the local gradient vectors, we have established a proper transmission strategy to construct a sparse transmitted signal that aggregates the signals sent from all the wireless devices at each radio resource.
Based on this transmission strategy, we have proposed a compressive sensing algorithm enabling the central server to iteratively find the LMMSE estimate of the transmitted signal.
We have also analyzed the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and demonstrated that when the transmitted signal is sparse, the proposed algorithm requires a significantly lower complexity compared to the LMMSE method.
Using simulations, we have demonstrated that the presented approach outperforms the linear beamforming approaches in terms of the accuracy, while reducing the performance gap between federated learning and centralized learning with perfect reconstruction.

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An important direction for future research is to extend our compressive sensing approach by developing a proper device scheduling algorithm. In this extension, a joint optimization of device scheduling and local gradient reconstruction may further improve the performance of federated learning, particularly when the number of wireless devices is much larger than the number of server’s antennas.
Another important research direction is to develop a proper downlink transmission strategy for broadcasting the parameter vector to the wireless devices and investigate its impact on the performance of federated learning over a massive MIMO system.
It would also be important to provide convergence analysis of federated learning with the proposed approach, in order to shed light on the potentials and limitations of federated learning over practical wireless communication systems. To this end, it would be possible to apply or extend the techniques introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
