<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds is of significant importance in environment perception and scene understanding. However, point clouds collected from real-world environments are usually imbalanced and small-sized objects are prone to be under-sampled or misclassified due to their low occurrence frequency, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of semantic segmentation. In this study, we propose the Multilateral Cascading Network (MCNet) for large-scale and sample-imbalanced point cloud scenes. To increase the frequency of small-sized objects, we introduce the semantic-weighted sampling module, which incorporates a probability parameter into the collected data group. To facilitate feature learning, we propose a Multilateral Cascading Attention Enhancement (MCAE) module to learn complex local features through multilateral cascading operations and attention mechanisms. To promote feature fusion, we propose a Point Cross Stage Partial (P-CSP) module to combine global and local features, optimizing the integration of valuable feature information across multiple scales. Finally, we introduce the neighborhood voting module to integrate results at the output layer. Our proposed method demonstrates either competitive or superior performance relative to state-of-the-art approaches across three widely recognized benchmark datasets: S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban with mIoU scores of 74.0%, 82.9% and 64.5%, respectively. Notably, our work yielded consistent optimal results on the under-sampled semantic categories, thereby demonstrating exceptional performance in the recognition of small-sized objects.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As urban areas undergo a continuous process of transformation from digitization to intelligent systems and subsequently to smart systems, digital twins emerge as a pivotal technological avenue for the realization of smart cities. Point cloud data, due to its powerful spatial representation capabilities, plays a crucial role in this process. It offers a comprehensive representation of the geometry and structure of physical objects and environments. Semantic segmentation is a critical task of leveraging point cloud data, which involves classifying each point within the cloud into meaningful categories. This process enables a deeper understanding of spatial environments, facilitating improved object recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qi et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, scene interpretation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Moyano et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(El-Sheimy and Li, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the early stages of point cloud semantic segmentation research, the majority of methods relied on rule-based ideas or machine learning with manually designed features. However, in recent years, deep learning methods have emerged as the dominant choice. The initial deep learning-based point cloud methods directly leverage the advancements in image processing and related fields, thus these approaches frequently rely on transforming the point cloud data into intermediate representations. The classification of these methods is based on the preprocessing techniques that are employed, and they can be divided into two categories: projection-based and voxel-based. Projection-based methods involve mapping 3D point cloud data onto 2D images from multiple viewpoints, followed by the application of 2D deep learning algorithms to extract features from each image, and pooling operations to aggregate global features. However, this approach can introduce quantization artifacts and result in information loss, particularly due to the selection of projection angles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bello et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. In contrast, voxel-based methods convert 3D point clouds into uniform voxel grids, utilizing 3D convolutions for feature extraction. Although this approach addresses certain challenges associated with projection-based methods, it incurs a cubic increase in computational costs as voxel resolution rises <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, making it less feasible for large-scale point cloud datasets. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for developing more efficient and accurate point cloud semantic segmentation techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The groundbreaking development of PointNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qi et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>)</cite> enabled the direct processing of 3D point clouds. Since its introduction, various advanced neural networks based on points have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qi et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017b</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Qian et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. These methods have greatly facilitated the development of point cloud processing techniques in the context of deep learning, especially semantic segmentation. Early works mainly focused on small-scale datasets and scenes. As the field of research progresses, there is an increasing focus on large-scale semantic segmentation of point clouds within real-world contexts. A variety of methods have been developed and evaluated for this purpose. For example, SPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Landrieu and Simonovsky, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> addresses the issue of managing large data sets by converting extensive point clouds into hypergraphs prior to training the model. Nevertheless, this hypergraph preprocessing introduces a considerable computational burden. To address this challenge, the RandLA-Net was introduced as a lightweight network that employs random downsampling and local feature aggregation blocks, thereby enhancing segmentation performance while significantly reducing training costs. This represents a significant advance in the field of deep learning networks, establishing a new benchmark for large-scale point cloud segmentation tasks. Similarly, KPConv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Thomas et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> is a kernel-based convolutional network designed for point clouds, effectively extending convolutional operations to 3D data. The network demonstrates particular efficacy in learning specific features of 3D structural objects, as evidenced by its success in segmenting objects with broad applicability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, while current large-scale deep learning point cloud segmentation networks have demonstrated notable success in identifying larger samples, such as ground, buildings, and trees in urban environments, their performance in recognizing smaller samples (e.g., bicycles and railways) has been less satisfactory. The issues can be summarized as follows: 1) In large-scale real-world scenes, a substantial imbalance exists in the number of instances among various object categories, which results in inadequate training for the underrepresented categories. 2) Point cloud data is distinguished by its disordered, unstructured, and uneven distribution. A limitation of solely focusing on global feature extraction is the loss of local details. 3) Currently, numerous networks employ sophisticated multi-layer architectures. As the number of layers increases, there is a risk of losing global details. In general, the diversity of objects in real-world scenes represents a significant challenge for models to efficiently learn inter-object correlations within their contexts. Enhancing the performance of large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation in real-world scenarios is of vital importance, particularly in addressing the long-tail problem caused by sample imbalance and improving segmentation effectiveness for semantic categories that comprise a small portion of the overall dataset.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many studies on point cloud semantic segmentation have leveraged advancements in image convolutional neural networks (CNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. These approaches typically transform 3D point clouds into 2D images through projection or flattening methods, followed by feature learning for object recognition. However, such techniques face challenges related to visibility and occlusion, which often limits their ability to utilize the intrinsic geometric properties of point clouds fully.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these challenges, several methods have integrated multimodal features derived from 3D scanning. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kundu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> effectively utilized strategically positioned cameras to create multi-view images from point clouds, facilitating segmentation tasks. In another approach, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu et al.

A probability parameter is introduced for each point based on the distance ratio between the point and its corresponding central point.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of the model training phase is to enhance the model’s capacity for learning local features across neighborhood point clouds and facilitate feature aggregation at different levels. To this end, we have developed a novel network, designated the Multilaterally Cascading Network (MCNet). Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Voxel-based Scheme ‣ 2 Related work ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts the architecture of the MCNet. The model employs an encoder-decoder structure and comprises two modules: the Multilateral Cascading Attention Enhancement (MCAE) module and the Point Cross Stage Partial (P-CSP) module. First, the point cloud information is transmitted to the MCAE module for feature learning at the encoding layer. Then, the P-CSP module is used at the decoding layer to aggregate sampled features with comparable features. Finally, the neighborhood voting module generates the final result by voting based on the neighborhood information.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.7" class="ltx_p">The proposed MCAE module, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, has been specifically designed to fully exploit multidimensional feature information in a cascaded manner. In addition to their spatial coordinates, point cloud data may also include a variety of attributes, including color, normals, depth, and others. The full exploitation of this information can markedly enhance a model’s capacity to comprehend intricate point cloud environments. To improve the model’s discriminative capability, we explore the relationships among points in a local vicinity, utilizing both the relative positional information and color attributes between a central point and its surrounding neighbors. In the initial stage, a centroid point is selected to obtain its coordinate information <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{P_{i}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">P</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑃</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">{P_{i}}</annotation></semantics></math> <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(x,y,z)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">x</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.3.cmml">z</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2.4" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3b"><vector id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.4.2"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3.3">𝑧</ci></vector></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.3c">(x,y,z)</annotation></semantics></math> and color information <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{F_{i}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">F</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝐹</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1c">{F_{i}}</annotation></semantics></math> <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(R,G,B)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">R</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.2.2.cmml">G</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.3.cmml">B</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2.4" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3b"><vector id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.4.2"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝑅</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.2.2">𝐺</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3.3">𝐵</ci></vector></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.m4.3c">(R,G,B)</annotation></semantics></math> .

The advent of residual blocks has the potential to mitigate the issue of gradient vanishing in complex point cloud data networks. Ultimately, max pooling is employed to downsample the features, ensuring their suitability for the subsequent scale layer. The aforementioned series of operations results in the formation of a cascading loop of original features at varying scales. This approach enables the model to learn and preserve features at each layer efficiently.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decoding phase of the network primarily entails fusing sampled features with features at the same scale, maximizing the integration of valuable feature information across all scales. Motivated by the CSPNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> architecture, we introduce a P-CSP enhanced learning module designed to aggregate features across different scales, depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2.1 MCAE Module ‣ 3.2 Network Framework ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. After feature entry, the feature matrix is divided into two branches. One branch should utilize a CBL layer and propagate through residual backpropagation, while the other should pass through a CBL layer and learn directly via residual blocks. The dashed line in the middle indicates that multiple residual blocks can be added as needed. Notably, the number of feature channels for both branches is halved during the learning process. This module enhances gradient combinations while also preserving or enhancing the scale connectivity accuracy in the presence of residual backpropagation. Finally, KNN and reshape methods are utilized to incorporate local feature information into the features. The output results are obtained after passing through a CBL layer.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of the SensatUrban dataset, it was divided into ten parts, and six parts were selected as test sets and the rest parts were for training. Voxel sampling was performed at 0.2 cm intervals for this dataset. To balance model performance and hardware limitations, we selected 16,384 neighborhood points based on central points as input to optimize the receptive field. After downsampling, the label categories and their distributions in the training and test sets of SensatUrban were detailed in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Data Preprocessing ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

The categories "Bikes" and "Rail" had the fewest samples and belonged to small-sized objects, representing only one-thousandth of the point cloud data compared to the "Ground" category, which had the highest number of samples. This imbalance underscores the uneven distribution of point cloud data across different categories in the dataset.</p>

The red boxes indicate that MCNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy or demonstrates more pronounced segmentation boundaries compared to RandLA-Net in these regions. Visually, MCNet clearly shows improved segmentation performance for categories such as board, wall, and table. This enhancement is attributed to the proposed MCAE module, which leverages a cascading structure to learn complex local feature representations and employs residual skip connections to minimize detail loss during the feature extraction process. However, there are notable discrepancies in the finer details, particularly with regard to distinguishing walls from beams.</p>

In particular, MCNet exhibited the most effective segmentation capabilities for the categories "nature" and "fence" within the Toronto3D dataset. In comparison to BAAF-Net, NeiEA-Net, and LACV-Net, our method demonstrated superior results across all categories. However, MCNet demonstrated inferior performance in classifying pole and car compared to BAF-LAC, which can be attributed to BAF-LAC’s integration of multi-scale point cloud features through its encoding and decoding context. In contrast, TCFAP-Net achieved the best results for building segmentation, largely due to its cross-attention mechanism, which adaptively assigns weights to features.</p>

First, the red box at the top of the figure contrasts the segmentation results for the "Nature" category. Our method successfully segmented and distinguished "Nature" from "Building", whereas RandLA-Net failed to segment correctly, mistakenly classifying part of the "Nature" category as "Building". Next, we compare the segmentation results for the zebra crossing in the middle of the figure. Clearly, our method provided superior results, delineating the zebra crossing contours more clearly and accurately segmenting the rectangular stripes. In contrast, RandLA-Net failed to segment the zebra crossing effectively, resulting in poor segmentation outcomes. This discrepancy is primarily due to our method’s P-CSP module, which integrates global and local features during the upsampling phase, optimizing feature information fusion across network layers. In contrast, RandLA-Net relies solely on transposed convolution for upsampling, which leads to the acquisition of ineffective information during the process.</p>

Our method substantially outperformed these models in classifying the "bike" category. Only SCF-Net demonstrated a modest segmentation capability for bikes (16.20%), while other models exhibited minimal segmentation performance for this category. In contrast, our method improved the IoU for the "bike" category by 8.4%, highlighting MCNet’s effectiveness in handling small-sized objects. The excellent performance on small samples (e.g., "bike" and "rail") is largely attributed to our semantic-based weighted sampling approach, which enhances the learning rate for these samples. Additionally, MCNet also outperformed other models in segmenting the "ground" category, attributed to the cascading structure of the MCAE module that enhances feature learning, and the Neighborhood Voting module in the output stage that improves semantic aggregation.</p>

Among the components, the MCAE module exerts the most significant impact, highlighting the importance of enhancing local feature learning to boost model performance. In contrast, the removal of the P-CSP module significantly weakens the network’s ability to aggregate features, resulting in a noticeable performance drop. Similarly, eliminating the neighborhood voting module affects model accuracy and hampers the ability to fully exploit the learned features. These ablation experiments clearly demonstrate that the local modules we designed are key to achieving the model’s optimal performance.</p>

This highly uneven distribution of samples can lead to under-sampling of small objects, resulting in poor segmentation performance for these categories. The significance of object segmentation should not be evaluated based solely on the percentage of occupied points; even minor objects can have a profound impact, such as vehicles and pedestrians, which play a pivotal role in applications such as autonomous driving.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach incorporates a semantic-based weighted sampling module to down-sample the point cloud data. This method considers the varying proportions of different object point clouds, increasing the sampling rate for small object categories, thereby mitigating the issue of sample imbalance (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). As demonstrated in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.4 Semantic Segmentation Results ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ Enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale and Imbalanced Point Clouds" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, our method effectively segments the bike category, achieving a mIoU of 24.8%, whereas previous methods failed to segment this category. Additionally, the encoder-decoder structure and the feature extraction and fusion techniques we employed have shown robust performance across three large-scale datasets, confirming their efficacy in large-scale point cloud segmentation.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our method is critically dependent on the scale and quality of the input dataset. Insufficient training data can significantly impair the model’s generalization capabilities. Additionally, our model leverages not only the coordinate information of the point clouds but also their RGB attributes. However, not all LiDAR systems are equipped to capture RGB information, and relying exclusively on point cloud coordinates can compromise segmentation performance. In real-world scenarios, point cloud data may be partially occluded due to complex architectural structures and intervening objects such as trees, leading to reduced segmentation accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world large-scale scenarios, point cloud data are challenging to obtain, and their labeling relies on manual annotation, which is time-consuming, hindering the training of practical networks. Future work could focus on leveraging self-supervised or semi-supervised algorithms to reduce dependence on extensive labeled data. These approaches, combined with traditional machine learning algorithms, can potentially mitigate data dependency. To address the challenge of missing point cloud data, pre-processing steps could incorporate point cloud completion networks or generative models to generate comprehensive data. Additionally, as dataset sizes continue to grow, the development of more lightweight networks is an imperative direction for further research.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study aims to advance semantic segmentation for large-scale, real-world point clouds, specifically targeting the recognition of under-sampled and small-sized objects. The primary contributions of this research are: First, a semantic-weighted sampling technique is proposed to increase the attention frequency on small-sized objects, thereby enhancing their recognition accuracy. Following this, a multilateral cascading encoding module is developed to effectively capture the structural characteristics of neighboring regions and integrate semantic data, resulting in more accurate segmentation. Furthermore, the point cross stage partial module is proposed for feature fusion. Finally, the output is augmented through neighborhood voting. Our research demonstrated that through this approach, we achieved performance that was comparable to other methods on three large-scale point cloud datasets, particularly excelling in semantic categories with small sample sizes. To comprehensively examine the properties of each component and to demonstrate the efficacy of our model, we also conducted ablation experiments. Overall, this study presents an advancement in the process of semantically segmenting large-scale and sample-imbalanced point clouds.</p>
