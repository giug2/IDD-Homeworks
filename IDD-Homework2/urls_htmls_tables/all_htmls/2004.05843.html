<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) will be transformative with the advancement of artificial intelligence and high-dimensional data analysis, shifting from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”.
This shall unleash the full potential of intelligent IoT in a plethora of exciting applications, such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, healthcare, robotics, and supply chain finance.
These applications drive the need of developing revolutionary computation, communication and artificial intelligence technologies that can make low-latency decisions with massive real-time data.
To this end, federated machine learning, as a disruptive technology, is emerged to distill intelligence from the data at network edge, while guaranteeing device privacy and data security.
However, the limited communication bandwidth is a key bottleneck of model aggregation for federated machine learning over radio channels.
In this article, we shall develop an over-the-air computation based communication-efficient federated machine learning framework for intelligent IoT networks via exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel.
Reconfigurable intelligent surface is further leveraged to reduce the model aggregation error via enhancing the signal strength by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environments.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to enable automated data transmission and offer ubiquitous wireless connectivity for trillions of devices (e.g., smart phones and sensors) with the capabilities of sensing, communication, computation and control. The vast amount of data generated by IoT devices can be exploited to extract useful information by machine learning, thereby enabling various intelligent IoT services. The emerging intelligent IoT applications include self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotics, healthcare, and supply chain finance, etc. However, enabling the paradigm shift from “connected things” to “connected intelligence” in the era of 6G via modern machine learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> faces three main challenges among others. First, transmitting data with private information to the cloud server is susceptible to eavesdropping and data modification attacks. Second, aggregating a large volume of distributed data for model learning over radio channels is likely to cause network congestion and lead to excessive network latency, due to limited spectrum resources. Third, many connected devices have strong computation capabilities, which have not been fully exploited to collaboratively train sophisticated models with high performance and accuracy requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is a promising solution for privacy-sensitive and low-latency intelligent IoT applications and has the capability of harnessing distributed computation resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, federated machine learning allows each IoT device to keep its data locally and only requires each IoT device to upload its locally updated model to the edge aggregation server during model training via wireless links.
This prevents revealing the collected data at the IoT devices to other devices and the aggregation server, thereby enhancing device privacy and data security.
The shared global model with high prediction accuracy can be learned at the edge aggregation server by coordinating a fleet of IoT devices to participate model aggregation.
The learning latency can be significantly reduced by leveraging advanced federated machine learning techniques to avoid offloading data to the cloud data center.
Although more selected devices can yield better model aggregation performance, periodical model updating from the selected IoT devices becomes the key communication bottleneck to unleash the full potential of federated machine learning for intelligent IoT applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation (AirComp) provides a novel simultaneous access technique to support fast local model aggregation for federated machine learning via exploiting the signal superposition property of multi-access channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This can be achieved by concurrent transmissions of analog locally updated models at each device, followed by directly receiving the average of local models at the edge server. This perfectly matches the functional computation of a weighted average of the local model updates for model aggregation to update a global model at the edge server in federated machine learning. Instead of treating the signals from other devices as interference in conventional multiple access schemes for mobile data services, AirComp is able to harness interference to reduce the spectrum resource requirements in the learning process over radio channels. However, the performance of AirComp is still limited by the unfavorable wireless propagation conditions.</p>

An RIS is typically a flat artificial metasurface consists of many passive reflecting elements with adjustable phase shifts, each of which is software-controlled by a smart controller. Through jointly controlling all reflecting elements, RIS is able to introduce a desired phase shift on the incident signals, which can be exploited to enhance the signal power and mitigate the co-channel interference.
In addition, it turns out that RIS has the huge potential to be integrated with many emerging technologies, including edge machine learning, multiple-input multiple-output communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, Terahertz communication, and sparse-code multiple access <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The machine learning technologies become indispensable for enabling intelligent IoT services by distilling intelligence from the data, such as self-driving cars, UAVs, healthcare, etc.
In the conventional cloud-based machine learning systems, the data generated or collected by a large number of devices need to be transmitted to a centralized cloud server, which is competent to train an artificial intelligence (AI) model.
With the growth of computation power of IoT devices and due to the increasing concern over data security and privacy, pushing the AI engine from the cloud server to the network edge has attracted enormous academic and industrial efforts. Federated machine learning provides a novel solution for collaboratively training a global machine learning model by leveraging the distributed computation resources across IoT devices, while always keeping the data locally at devices.</p>

The aggregation server maintains and updates a global model, while each IoT device trains a local model.
The global and local models are iteratively updated through a number of communication rounds until the consensus of the global model is reached.

In particular, the data from industrial monitoring in supply chain systems need to be transferred among different business entities and can be exploited to identify and extract underlying patterns with cutting-edge machine learning technologies.
Being highly sensitive and also the key interests of business entities, the supply chain data however are vulnerable to security issues in such a distributed system.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although presenting great potentials for intelligent IoT, federated machine learning still encompasses a number of challenges, such as limited battery power, unbalanced number of data, heterogeneous computational capabilities, etc.
In particular, communication bottleneck becomes one critical challenge in federated machine learning for intelligent IoT applications due to the limited radio resources and the iterative transmission of high-dimensional model-update parameters.
Specifically, the learning process of federated machine learning typically incurs hundreds of communication rounds, in each of which many devices update local models through a wireless multi-access channel.
The communication loads for iterative model updates grow linearly with the number of involved IoT devices when the conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme is adopted.
A high volume of communication loads may lead to severe network congestion, which in turn incurs excessive network latency.
To tackle the communication bottleneck during the model aggregation period in federated machine learning over radio channels, we shall present a new simultaneous access scheme based on AirComp to reduce the required radio resources by integrating the computation and communication. The reconfigurable intelligent surface is further leveraged to boost the performance of AirComp via alleviating the unfavorable wireless propagation conditions.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For computing a function value of the data at distributed mobile devices, i.e., wireless data aggregation, the conventional approach that separates communication and computation normally yields tremendous communication overheads. AirComp turns out to be an effective wireless data aggregation approach via exploiting the signal superposition property of the wireless multiple access channel. The class of target functions that can be computed over-the-air is called the nomographic function. Basically, a nomographic function can be evaluated by pre-processing the input data at each device, and then taking the sum of all data after preprocessing, followed by post-processing the summation. Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Principles of Over-the-Air Computation ‣ III Over-the-air Computation for Federated Machine Learning ‣ Federated Machine Learning for Intelligent IoT via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the procedures of computing a nomographic function from distributed IoT devices using the AirComp approach. Specifically, the input data after pre-processing is encoded as the transmit symbol at each device. By transmitting the encoded information symbols at all IoT devices over the wireless multiple access channel, the sum of all pre-processed input data can be directly decoded at the receiver with carefully designed transmit and receive strategies. The target function can be obtained by post-processing the sum of all pre-processed input data.</p>

It demonstrates that interference can be harnessed for computing functional values instead of being canceled, thereby significantly reducing the radio resource requirements.
Recent years have witnessed enormous research efforts on AirComp from different aspects. Research works from the information theoretic view have studied the structured code design for different distributions of the input data, including independent Gaussian, correlated Gaussian, sum of independent Gaussian, etc.
There have also been a number of works focusing on the transmitter and receiver beamforming design for reducing the aggregation error of AirComp. In addition, the uncertainty of the channel state information has been considered for robust AirComp.

Fortunately, the weighted average function falls into the category of nomographic functions that can be computed based on the principles of the AirComp. Therefore, the fast global model aggregation can be achieved via harnessing the interference with much less communication bandwidth, which motivates the AirComp based fast model aggregation approach in federated machine learning. Due to the existence of noise, there are however inevitably function distortions with AirComp.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A key observation of federated machine learning is that model aggregation with large distortions could induce a notable performance drop of the model prediction accuracy. The mean-squared-error (MSE) is usually adopted as the performance metric to characterize the model aggregation error. Another key observation of federated machine learning is that more involved devices at each training round could accelerate the convergence rate of the model training process. Based on these two key observations of federated machine learning, a joint device selection and receiver beamforming design problem is formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for fast model aggregation of federated machine learning, thereby simultaneously improving the model accuracy and model training speed.</p>

In particular, the RIS is engineered to have periodic EM structures and be composed of a large number of passive sub-wavelength metallic scattering elements.
With those specially designed scattering elements, the extreme values of effective permittivity and permeability coefficients can be electronically tuned to adjust the EM properties (e.g., phase shift) of incident waves.
In addition, the controllable scattering elements can be implemented by variable lumped elements such as PIN diodes, varactor diodes, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), or tunable materials such as ferro-electric thin film liquid crystal and graphene.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For AirComp-based federated machine learning, minimizing the model aggregation error that is quantified by MSE is crucial for enhancing the learning performance.
It is worth noting that the MSE is critically dependent upon the channel conditions between the devices and the aggregation server.
As the RIS is capable of achieving desired channel responses by enabling software-controlled phase shift, it is possible to reduce the MSE of model aggregation with the assistance of RIS, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B RIS-Empowered AirComp for Model Aggregation ‣ IV Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Empowered Over-The-Air Computation ‣ Federated Machine Learning for Intelligent IoT via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Compared with other smart radio environment approaches such as relay or active reflecting surfaces, RIS has the unique advantages of flexible deployment and low power consumption due to its passive nature.
Specifically, reducing the MSE of the aggregated global model improves the accuracy of the model prediction.
Moreover, a smaller MSE makes it possible to select more devices at each communication round, which in turn speeds up the convergence of federated machine learning.</p>

To this end, the phase shifts of reflecting elements at the RIS should be optimized to minimize the MSE of model aggregation.
The resulting MSE minimization problem requires the joint design of receive beamformer at the aggregation server and the phase shifts at the RIS.
Such a problem is generally a computationally difficult nonconvex bi-quadratic programming problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, i.e., nonconvex quadratic with respect to both the receive beamformer and RIS phase shift matrix.
To decouple the optimization variables, the receive beamformer and the phase shifts are updated in an alternating fashion.
In each alternation, it is required to solve a nonconvex quadratic constrained optimization problem, which can be addressed by developing a low-rank optimization approach with a DC algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
