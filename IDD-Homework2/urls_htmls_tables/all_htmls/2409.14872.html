<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning methods have been used to optimize long-term user engagement in recommendation systems. However, existing reinforcement learning-based recommendation systems do not fully exploit the relevance of individual user behavior across different platforms. One potential solution is to aggregate data from various platforms in a centralized location and use the aggregated data for training. However, this approach raises economic and legal concerns, including increased communication costs and potential threats to user privacy. To address these challenges, we propose <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedSlate</span>, a federated reinforcement learning recommendation algorithm that effectively utilizes information that is prohibited from being shared at a legal level. We employ the SlateQ algorithm to assist FedSlate in learning users’ long-term behavior and evaluating the value of recommended content. We extend the existing application scope of recommendation systems from single-user single-platform to single-user multi-platform and address cross-platform learning challenges by introducing federated learning. We use RecSim to construct a simulation environment for evaluating FedSlate and compare its performance with state-of-the-art benchmark recommendation models. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effects of FedSlate over baseline methods in various environmental settings, and FedSlate facilitates the learning of recommendation strategies in scenarios where baseline methods are completely inapplicable.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the significant influence of users’ instant reactions to recommended content on their future behavior, research in the realm of content recommendation systems has increasingly adopted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategies. These strategies aim to optimize the balance between immediate user engagement and long-term retention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, recent advancements in advertising recommendation systems have integrated reinforcement learning to achieve a balance between generating ad revenue and minimizing negative user experiences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, these systems often overlook an essential aspect: user behavior is not isolated but affected by recommendations from various platforms, indicating interdependencies between a user’s activities across different services. An obvious solution to leverage these behavioral correlations is to consolidate user data from multiple sources for the development of a unified model. Nevertheless, the introduction of stringent data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, raises significant legal challenges. Directly employing user data could infringe upon privacy rights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> poses a barrier to the straightforward implementation of centralized learning approaches. To circumvent these obstacles while harnessing the coherence in user behavior across platforms, we advocate for the adoption of federated learning (FL) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to refine reinforcement learning-based recommendation algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In numerous contexts, the correlation between user behaviors yields substantial benefits. Within the financial sector, for instance, customers often engage with both stock trading and online payment services. A collaborative model trained by these services can effectively ascertain a customer’s risk profile, investment patterns, and spending behaviors, thereby facilitating tailored financial product recommendations that meet individual needs. Similarly, in the realm of online advertising, user interactions with multiple platforms reveal interconnected behaviors. A user may explore health foods on a social network while simultaneously shopping for wellness products on an e-commerce site. Utilizing FL, platforms can collectively develop a model that captures the user’s interests and buying inclinations, enhancing the precision of targeted advertising. Consequently, a recommendation system underpinned by FL presents an approach that optimizes privacy, minimizes communication overhead, and improves long-term value for users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recommendation systems commonly adopt a slate-based approach, wherein multiple items are simultaneously suggested to the user, allowing them to select and view their preferred item. This presents a significant challenge for the direct application of reinforcement learning (RL) due to the large action space involved. SlateQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a recommendation algorithm that utilizes the slate decomposition technique to address the challenge of recommending multiple items, known as a recommendation slate, to users. It effectively resolves the issue of the large action space faced by previous RL recommendation algorithms. However, SlateQ can only be deployed separately on different platforms and cannot be easily extended to the scenario of joint deployment across multiple platforms. As a result, it fails to leverage the correlations between user behaviors on different platforms. To address this problem, we propose FedSlate, assuming that a user’s behavior and response on one platform can be influenced by the recommended content from other platforms. Furthermore, certain influences are regarded as “inaccessible” to specific platforms. Specifically, we assume that certain agents are unable to directly receive rewards (even though the rewards exist), and these agents cannot make decisions based solely on their own information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our FedSlate algorithm incorporates both local and global models. However, unlike the adaptive personalized federated learning (APFL) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, we do not blend the local and global models proportionally. Instead, we adopt a method similar to “Q-value sharing” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, where the local models generate Q-values that are passed as inputs to the central server. The central server then computes the global Q-values used for content recommendation selection. FedSlate can be divided into the following stages. First, dedicated agents on each platform calculate local Q-values based on observed user states and candidate recommendation content states. They transmit these values to the central server. Next, the central server collects the received local Q-values as inputs to the global Q-network and calculates the corresponding global Q-values for each local agent. Finally, the central server distributes the Q-values to the respective agents, and the local agents make policy selections based on the received Q-values. It is important to note that each agent is unaware of the Q-network parameters of other agents. The central server calculates the global Q-values as many times as there are local agents since each agent has its own distinct “local Q-values”. These stages do not include the process of updating the local and global Q-networks. In FedSlate, we iteratively update the global network and local network based on the outputs of the global Q-network and the rewards obtained by an agent in its environment. During this process, the global network is updated multiple times, while the local network is updated only once.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Prior research on FL in recommendation systems mainly focused on applying this technique to conventional algorithms, as evidenced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These methods typically average local model outputs without accounting for user heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which can be problematic given the diverse and imbalanced nature of user preferences. Such systems are often inadequate in reflecting long-term user interests. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FedSlate, a novel algorithm that marries the concepts of SlateQ and FL. FedSlate is adept at tracking long-term user behavior and assimilating the impact of cross-platform recommendations on user activity within a singular platform. By leveraging both local and global models and adopting a “Q-value sharing” technique, FedSlate facilitates the central server in generating comprehensive Q-values for optimal content recommendation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recommender systems are a critical type of information filtering system that leverages user preference and behavior analysis to provide personalized suggestions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. These systems are extensively applied in various sectors, including e-commerce, social media, and entertainment platforms like music and video streaming, aiming to enhance content discovery and improve the overall user experience. Supervised learning (SL) techniques are commonly utilized in these systems to perform predictive and recommendatory functions, relying on patterns and rules derived from labeled training data. In this realm, training datasets, which include users’ historical interactions and their corresponding feedback or ratings, are instrumental. Among the prevalent SL-based methodologies for recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) stands out <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. User-based CF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> suggests items by identifying similarities between users’ past behaviors, positing that users with comparable preferences are likely to be interested in similar items. Conversely, item-based CF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, recommends based on item similarities. These CF methods are favored for their simplicity and proven effectiveness. Content-based recommendations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> represent another widespread SL approach, employing item characteristics and user preferences to formulate suggestions. For example, a movie recommendation system may use a content-based method to recommend movies by considering aspects such as genre, actors, and directors, thus predicting a user’s potential interests. Furthermore, SL-based recommender systems may integrate various machine learning models, including decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, support vector machines (SVM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and deep neural networks (DNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. These models enhance the recommendation process by adapting to diverse dataset features and characteristics while learning from users’ preferences and behavior patterns during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SL-based recommender systems have shown proficiency in short-term prediction tasks; however, incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) has been identified as critical for long-term prediction challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. RL, a machine learning paradigm, seeks to establish optimal behavioral policies through environmental interactions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and distinguishes itself by concentrating on goal-directed decision-making, employing a trial-and-error process with a rewards system. This method excels in scenarios requiring foresight, such as financial investment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and complex planning, due to its adeptness at managing delayed rewards. In the medical domain, where uncertainty and dynamic conditions are prevalent, like ventilator management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, RL’s attributes prove exceptionally beneficial. Within RL-based recommendations, there are “model-based” and “model-free” methods; our focus is on the “model-free” category, which is straightforward to implement and yields superior long-term performance. Before this approach, DRN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> implemented a deep Q-network (DQN) to create user profiles and an activity score. Subsequently, the social attentive deep Q-network (SADQN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> enhanced DQN with an attention mechanism to leverage social influences. Diverging from these, our contribution, FedSlate, leverages cross-platform user performance similarities. While some studies have adopted policy gradient methods, such as the Monte Carlo-based REINFORCE algorithm for large-scale recommendation environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the SlateQ algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is particularly influential in our approach. It decomposes the Q-value of a recommendation slate into individual item Q-values, effectively managing extensive action spaces and offering three item-wise Q-value-based selection strategies. Notwithstanding, existing RL-based systems primarily optimize for single-platform performance, neglecting the multiplatform influences on real-world users. To address this gap, we propose the incorporation of FL paradigms into RL-based recommendation systems.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL involves training statistical models directly on devices to develop a joint model capable of generating data across distributed nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Traditional distributed learning methods generally presuppose that local data samples are independently and identically distributed (IID); however, FL typically operates under the premise that data among clients is non-IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Prior research has primarily utilized RL to enhance FL’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> employs a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) strategy to select devices for participation in successive communication rounds, thus minimizing the number of required rounds. Related work can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. In contrast, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> applies a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to modulate the CPU frequency of faster devices within an FL training cohort, balancing energy efficiency with training velocity. Distinct from these studies, our FedSlate algorithm “federates” DRL rather than simply applying RL to optimize FL. Concerning federated recommender systems, current studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, have mainly adapted FL for traditional recommendation frameworks, setting them apart from our DRL-centric FedSlate approach. The most significant influence on our work is Federated deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which introduces an innovative DRL paradigm to collaboratively construct high-quality models for agents. Our approach adopts the “Q-value sharing” concept from FedRL to monitor long-term user behaviors and evaluate the impact of recommended content from various platforms on a user’s actions within a specific platform, thus tackling the complexities of applying RL recommendation algorithms in a multi-platform context. While FedRL advocates for a decentralized scheme, our FedSlate algorithm is designed with centralization in mind but can also be adapted to a decentralized format for practical applications.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce an augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP) model tailored for the single-user, multi-platform context. This model captures the dynamics wherein platforms employ recommendation systems to curate slates of content. Users engage with these slates by selecting an item—or opting out—and post-consumption, decide whether to seek additional recommendations or end their session. It is important to note that users may transition across platforms in pursuing content that piques their interest, a pattern that closely reflects real-world user behavior. User responses to content are multifaceted, encompassing metrics such as browsing duration, “likes”, and comments. However, for the sake of a generalized model, we limit our focus to user engagement as the singular metric of reward. Subsequently, we outline the assumptions underpinning our problem, some aligning with the SlateQ framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and others specific to the single-user, multi-platform scenario.

We adopt this setting because certain platforms may not have direct access to user feedback on recommended content (although the platform’s impact on the user is real). User preferences or aversions may be reflected on other platforms. We aim to demonstrate the friendliness of FedSlate towards these “unavailable feedback” platforms—even if a platform cannot directly update its recommendation strategy based on user feedback, it can still benefit from performance improvements in the federation.</p>

In the loop of our algorithm, we first perform several rounds of “acting” to recommend slates to users and record their feedback. Then, we execute one iteration of “learning” to update the network using the collected experiences, thereby optimizing the recommendation strategy. This loop continues for multiple iterations during the training phase. Due to the modular design of our algorithm, we do not strictly differentiate between the training and testing phases. When there is no need for policy optimization, we simply skip the execution of the “learning” module in the loop. Similarly, if there are changes in the distribution of input data for the recommendation algorithm (e.g., business adjustments on the platform), the “learning” module can be reactivated.</p>

By considering these two aspects, we aim to demonstrate whether our algorithm can effectively exploit the consistency of user behavior across different platforms.

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We construct a “Choc vs. Kale” recommendation scenario, where the goal is to maximize user satisfaction and engagement over the long term by recommending a certain proportion of “chocolate” and “kale” elements. In this scenario, the “chocolate” element represents content that is interesting but not conducive to long-term satisfaction, while the “kale” element represents relatively less exciting but beneficial content for long-term satisfaction. The recommendation algorithm needs to balance these two elements to achieve maximized long-term user satisfaction. We believe this scenario aligns well with our assumption that “user responses to content on other platforms are influenced to some extent by the content they are exposed to on the current platform”. If a platform consistently recommends “chocolate” content to users, their long-term satisfaction is likely to be compromised.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FedSlate algorithm employs the extraction of information from the outputs of local networks and its transfer to the global network, which then calculates Q-values used for selecting recommended content. Given the operational mechanism of the algorithm, a concern arises regarding whether the global network tends to discard Q-values that do not originate from itself and solely outputs its own Q-values. Should such a situation occur, it would indicate that our FedSlate algorithm, when making recommendations, solely relies on information from individual platforms, akin to performing SlateQ separately on each platform, without engaging in FL. To investigate this matter, we conduct an ablation experiment.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the evaluation experiment of FedSlate, both the local and global networks are fully connected networks with five hidden layers. We employ the Mish function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> as the activation function Nonetheless, the hidden layers vary in size, with the local network possessing a larger size and the global network a smaller size. In the ablation experiment, we maintain the structure of the local network unchanged and simplify the global network as much as possible. We reduce the global network to a single hidden layer network and remove the activation function, transforming it into a simple Linear Model. Through this setup, we force FedSlate to directly utilize Q-values generated by the local network for recommendations. The experimental results, as depicted in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V-B Algorithm Evaluation ‣ V Experimental Setup ‣ FedSlate: A Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Recommender System* *Note: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the complexity of integrating user privacy data across diverse platforms into recommendation systems, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, designated as FedSlate. This algorithm is designed to develop superior recommendation tactics collaboratively across multiple agents while safeguarding user privacy. Utilizing RecSim, we established a multi-platform recommendation simulation to assess how our algorithm benefits various participants within Federated Learning (FL). Our research indicates that FedSlate effectively resolves the challenges of cross-platform learning in recommendation systems without necessitating the exchange of private data between platforms. Looking ahead, we aim to refine and broaden the scope of FedSlate in the realm of cross-platform recommendation systems that prioritize privacy. To this end, we plan to augment FedSlate with cutting-edge privacy protection methods, such as secure aggregation, differential privacy, and FL with encrypted data, as detailed by Lyu et al. (2022)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. These enhancements will ensure the integrity of user privacy throughout the collaborative learning process, even when handling sensitive data. Moreover, we will undertake comprehensive experiments and evaluations of the FedSlate algorithm in authentic recommendation settings involving diverse platforms and user bases. This will yield critical insights into the algorithm’s efficiency, scalability, and practical applicability, alongside its influence on user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
