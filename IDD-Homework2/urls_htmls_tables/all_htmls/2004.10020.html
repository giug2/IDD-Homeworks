<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated machine learning which enables resource-constrained node devices (<em id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> mobile phones and IoT devices) to learn a shared model while keeping the training data local, can provide privacy, security and economic benefits by designing an effective communication protocol. However, the communication protocol amongst different nodes could be exploited by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks, which has been demonstrated as a big threat to most machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to explore the vulnerability of federated machine learning. More specifically, we focus on attacking a federated multi-task learning framework, which is a federated learning framework via adopting a general multi-task learning framework to handle statistical challenges. We formulate the problem of computing optimal poisoning attacks on federated multi-task learning as a bilevel program that is adaptive to arbitrary choice of <em id="id1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target</em> nodes and <em id="id1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">source attacking</em> nodes. Then we propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, <span id="id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">ATT</span>ack on <span id="id1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning (AT<sup id="id1.1.7" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>FL), which is efficiency to derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further compute optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. Our work is an earlier study that considers issues of data poisoning attack for federated learning. To the end, experimental results on real-world datasets show that federated multi-task learning model is very sensitive to poisoning attacks, when the attackers either directly poison the <em id="id1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target</em> nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes by exploiting the communication protocol.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning has been widely-applied into a broad array of applications, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> spam filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and natural gas price prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Among these applications, the reliability or security of the machine learning system has been a great concern, including adversaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. For example, for product recommendation system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, researchers can either rely on public crowd-sourcing platform, <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> Amazon Mechanical Turk or Taobao, or private teams to collect training datasets. However, both of these above methods have the opportunity of being injected corrupted or poisoned data by attackers. To improve the robustness of real-world machine learning systems, it is critical to study how well machine learning performs under the poisoning attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the attack strategy on machine learning methods, it can be divided into two categories: causative attacks and exploratory attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, where exploratory attacks influence learning via controlling over training data, and exploratory attacks can take use of misclassifications without affecting training. However, previous researches on poisoning attacks focus on the scenarios that training samples are collected in a centralized location, or the training samples are sent to a centralized location via a distributed network, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> support vector machines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, autoregressive models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and collaborative filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, none of the current works study poisoning attacks on federated machine learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where the training data are distributed across multiple devices (<em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> users’ mobile devices: phones/tablets), and may be privacy sensitive. To further improve its robustness, in this paper, our work explores how to attack the federated machine learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the federated machine learning, its main idea is to build machine learning models based on data sets that are distributed across multiple devices while preventing data leakage. Although recent improvements have been focusing on overcoming the statistical challenges (<em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</em> the data collected across the network are in a <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-IID</em> manner, where the data on each node are generated by a distinct distribution) or improving privacy-preserving, the attempt that makes federated learning more reliability under poisoning attacks, is still scarce. For example, consider several different e-commerce companies in a same region, and the target is to establish a prediction model for product purchase based on user and product information, <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> user’s browsing and purchasing history. The attackers can control a prescribed number of user accounts and inject the poisoning data in a direct manner. Furthermore, due to the communication protocol existing amongst different companies, this protocol also opens a door for the attacker to indirectly affect the unaccessible <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target</em> nodes, which is also not addressed by existing poisoning methods whose training data are collected in a centralized location.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the aforementioned analysis, we attempt to analyze optimal poisoning attacks on federated machine learning. More specifically, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Data Poisoning Attacks on Federated Machine Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we focus on the recently-proposed federated multi-task learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a federated learning framework which captures node relationships among multiple nodes to tackle the statistical challenges in the federated setting. Our work is to formulate the optimal poisoning attack strategy on federated multi-task learning model as a general bilevel optimization problem, which can be adaptive to any choice of <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target</em> nodes and <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">source attacking</em> nodes. However, current optimization methods for this bilevel problem are not suited to tackle the systems challenges (<em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> high communication cost, stragglers) that exist in federated learning. As a key component of this work, we thus design a novel optimization method, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">ATT</span>ack on <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning (AT<sup id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>FL), to derive the implicit gradients for computing poisoned data in the <em id="S1.p4.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">source attacking</em> nodes. Furthermore, the obtained gradient can be effectively used to compute the optimal attack strategies.
Finally, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal attack strategy against random baselines on
several real-world datasets. The experiment results strongly support our proposed model when attacking federated machine learning based on the communication protocol.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we take an earlier attempt on how to effectively launch data poisoning attacks on federated machine learning. Benefitting from the communication protocol, we propose a bilevel data poisoning attacks formulation by following general data poisoning attacks framework, where it can include three different kinds of attacks. As a key contribution of this work, we design a <span id="S6.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">ATT</span>ack on <span id="S6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="S6.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning (AT<sup id="S6.p1.2.4" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>FL) to address the system challenges (<em id="S6.p1.2.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> high communication cost) existing in federated setting, and further compute optimal attack strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the attack strategies computed by AT<sup id="S6.p1.2.6" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>FL can significantly damage performances of real-world applications. From the study in this paper, we find that the communication protocol in federated learning can be used to effectively launch indirect attacks, <em id="S6.p1.2.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> when two nodes have strong correlation. Except for the horizontal federated learning in this work, we will consider the data poisoning attacks study on vertical (feature-based) federated learning and federated transfer learning in the future.</p>
