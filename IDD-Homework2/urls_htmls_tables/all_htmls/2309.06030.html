<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">We envision a system to continuously build and maintain a map based on <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">earth-scale</span> neural radiance fields (NeRF) using data collected from vehicles and drones in a lifelong learning manner.
However, existing large-scale modeling by NeRF has problems in terms of scalability and maintainability when modeling earth-scale environments.
Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a federated learning pipeline for large-scale modeling with NeRF.
We tailor the model aggregation pipeline in federated learning for NeRF, thereby allowing local updates of NeRF.
In the aggregation step, the accuracy of the clients’ global pose is critical.
Thus, we also propose global pose alignment to align the noisy global pose of clients before the aggregation step.
In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed pose alignment and the federated learning pipeline on the large-scale scene dataset, Mill19.</p>

Although these studies have been evaluated in relatively small-scale scenes, we believe that such NeRF-based robotics applications will be available to the systems operated in large-scale environments, such as self-driving cars and delivery drones.
In addition, since NeRF can lift arbitrary 2D information to 3D (<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, semantic labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and feature vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>), it will facilitate a higher-level environmental recognition and understanding in robotics applications.</p>

These methods divide a large-scale environment into many small areas and model the small areas with multiple NeRF models.
Although this pipeline efficiently models a large-scale scene in a distributed training manner, it has three problems in realizing our envisioned system: (i) The existing pipelines need to collect data in a server once, but they need high communication costs to collect data from clients on a server and need a large number of memory budgets to save the earth-scale data; (ii) these pipelines require tremendously large computational resources for training a large number of models to cover an earth-scale environment; and (iii) they can only update the model for each pre-divided area for the maintenance of the NeRF-based map, and if the training data is collected only in a part of the area, the model may suffer from the forgetting problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a data-decentralizing training protocol that enables clients, such as mobile devices, to collaboratively train a model while keeping the training data decentralized.
Since FL does not need to aggregate data collected by clients on the server, it can alleviate the communication cost problem and the data storage problem.
FL also alleviates the computational resource problem because it can leverage the resources of clients (millions or more in our scenario, and then their overall FLOPS will be much larger than those of supercomputers).</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To train NeRF in a federated learning manner, we tailor the model aggregation pipeline, which allows the global model to be locally updated based on the client data, avoiding the forgetting problem and improving maintainability.
Specifically, we cache the outputs of each local model as the 3D voxel grid, and then the global model is updated by aggregating cached representation based on the clients’ pose in the global coordinate.
This pipeline does not affect the outputs of the global model beyond the region modeled by the local models.
In addition, to align the inaccurate global pose of clients due to sensor noise, we propose the global pose alignment step before the aggregation step, which is inspired by the vision-based localization using NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

They used NeRF as a mapping module and reduced the memory budget for the map.
Moreover, pure NeRF-based SLAM systems, such as iMap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Nice-SLAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, were studied.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As reviewed above, NeRF is applied to robotics applications that use NeRF as a map.
When considering systems using NeRF as a map in a large environment, such as self-driving cars and delivery drones, we need to model large-scale scenes.
There are certain studies for large-scale scene modeling by NeRF.
Block-NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and Mega-NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have modeled urban-scale environments.
Both methods divide the target scene into small areas and then model the small areas with multiple NeRF models.
They can efficiently model a large-scale scene in a distributed training manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the existing large-scale modeling methods have some problems in terms of maintainability and computational costs.
When part of the scene is changed, they need to update all models representing the changed scene, even if the changed area is a part of the modeled area.
In addition, due to the forgetting problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the model needs to be trained with all data in the corresponding area if a part of the area is changed.
Therefore, maintaining the map created by existing methods is costly.
Moreover, these methods require tremendously large memory budgets to save data and large computational resources to model the environment if one builds an earth-scale NeRF-based map.
Hence, we approach these problems by adopting a federated learning scheme.</p>

It distributes the model to clients such as mobile devices or organizations, trains the model on clients using their own data, and aggregates the models on the server.
By repeating the above process, FL collaboratively trains a global model under the orchestration of a central server.
FL has some advantages: preserving privacy since it does not collect user data on the server and leveraging the computational resources of many clients.
Because of these advantages, FL has been studied for training machine learning models in various tasks, such as image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and self-supervised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

As major concerns, (i) the local models trained by clients are not build on the shared global coordinate.
In other words, rendered images from the same camera through different local models may show different regions.
(ii) the local models may have different appearance because each client may collect data at different time (<span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, nighttime and daytime).

Note that if the obtained poses are noisy, we would be able to correct them by using the methods that simultaneously optimize poses and the model (<span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, BARF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and NoPe-NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>).</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also assume that the global pose of each client is known but <span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">noisy</span>.
Since the goal of this study is to train the large-scale NeRF model as a map, there is no map to localize the position<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Once the map (<span id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the global model) is initialized, we can use it to localize each client in the same manner as that for iNeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span>.
In this situation, we need to use sensors such as GPS and IMU to obtain the global pose, but the pose obtained from the sensors basically contains noise.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For simplifying the pipeline, we assume that client models are trained from scratch because NeRF basically “overfits” training data and it does not care how the model is initialized.
Of course, we can consider the standard pipeline; namely, clients download the global model and then train it with the local data, which may make convergence faster but increase communication costs.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To avoid the aforementioned problem, we tailor the aggregation step for NeRF.
We represent the global model as the voxel grid, as in Plenoxels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
We cache the output of the local models on the voxel grid, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and then aggregate the cached voxel grid and the global model, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-C Updating Global Model ‣ III Federated Learning for NeRF ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Since we only cache the outputs in the area modeled by the local model and aggregate them, this procedure does not affect the output outside the area.
In addition, the voxel grid representation allows us to align the global pose of the clients before aggregation (Sec. <a href="#S3.SS4" title="III-D Global Pose Alignment ‣ III Federated Learning for NeRF ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-D</span></span></a>).
For other advantage of our aggregation scheme, it does not depend on the architecture of the local model, which is important for federated learning because we can select an appropriate architecture based on the client’s computational resources.</p>

We randomly sample the pose noises and then align them.

Our method can align the translation error up to 75 m, which is comparable to a typical GPS error.
Also, it can correct the rotation error that is larger than errors in a typical IMU.

We divide the scene into 4<math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>4 grids for the distributed training; that is, 16 models are trained, and the number of data for training each model is approximately 150, which is the same as the expected number of data used to train each model of our pipeline.
For a fair comparison, we evaluate these training pipelines with the same model and the same hyperparameters as ours, except for the model size in the baseline.
In other words, unlike Mega-NeRF, our distributed training do not use appearance modeling, and the number of training iterations is less.
Note that we assume that the global position is correctly aligned by our position alignment algorithm in this experiment.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The training time of distributed training and ours is much shorter than that of the baseline because of the distributed training protocol.
Since the scale of Mill19 is relatively small compared to our envisioned scenario, the training time of the baseline is acceptable.
However, if we scale it to an earth-scale, it is impossible to train a model with the standard training pipeline.
In addition to the reduction in training time, our method can alleviate bandwidth consumption because the size of the local model is 0.1 GB while that of the local data is up to 1 GB.
The rendering speed for the distributed training is slower than the others because the distributed training combines the outputs of the multiple models to render one image.
Rendering by ours is the fastest because it only samples cached outputs from the voxel grids for rendering, unlike the others that consist of hash encoding and MLP.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The PSNR for our method is worse than that for the baseline for two reasons: each client trains a local model with a relatively small number of data, while the baseline trains the model with a sufficiently large number of data.
Basically, NeRF requires a sufficiently large number of viewpoints to correctly represent the scene in 3D.
However, some clients do not satisfy this requirement around the test view and the local models trained by such clients cannot represent the scene correctly, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Comparison with Other Training Protocols ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Consequently, such local models degrade the global model performance.
This disadvantage is also found in distributed training; in fact, PSNR for distributed training is worse than that for the baseline.
The other reason is the quantization error in the caching process.
We cache the outputs of the local models on the voxel grid in the aggregation step, and such a quantization operation approximates the continuous function by the piece-wise linear function.
Thus, there are approximation errors, which cause the gap between PSNR for distributed training and ours, especially for the building scene that includes high-frequency components, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Comparison with Other Training Protocols ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
This error can be reduced by increasing the cached grid size, but it requires larger memory budgets.
Improving local model training and alleviating the quantization errors are possible directions for future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The PSNR for ours on the rubble scene is better than that for distributed training.
The quantization errors in the rubble scene are smaller than those in the building scene because images in the rubble scenes are basically composed of low-frequency components.
Therefore, in scenes where the effect of the errors is small, our training protocol would be better than distributed training in this experimental setting.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we mentioned in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Problem Definition and Assumptions ‣ III Federated Learning for NeRF ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>, this work does not consider dynamic and/or transient objects and lighting changes.
It may raise privacy concerns because if a person in the scene is modeled with the lighting, the model may show where and when the person was doing what.
However, we can remove such objects using image segmentation models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> as in Block-NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and can model multiple appearances using an appearance vector as in NeRF-W <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>; by exploiting the advantage of such methods, the proposed pipeline will leverage the privacy-preserving aspect of the federated learning.
Therefore, we believe that considering the transient objects and lighting changes in the federated learning pipeline is an important research direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, as we mentioned in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Comparison with Other Training Protocols ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning for Large-Scale Scene Modeling with Neural Radiance Fields" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>, the quality of the rendered images is worse than the images rendered by the baseline.
Fortunately, there are many studies on training NeRF with limited viewpoints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
We believe that we can improve the performance of the local models by leveraging the training protocol of such methods; consequently, the global model can be improved.
Another approach is to consider the number of viewpoints for aggregating models.
Specifically, by adjusting the mixing coefficient in the exponential moving average according to the number of viewpoints, we may be able to ignore the low-quality outputs of the local model in the aggregation step.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we proposed the federated learning pipeline for large-scale scene modeling with NeRF.
We designed the aggregation step for training NeRF in a federated learning manner: The global model is defined as the voxel grids and the local models are aggregated by caching the outputs of the local model on the voxel grids, which allows us to update the global model locally.
In addition, we proposed the global pose alignment step to alleviate the sensor noise in the global pose of each client.
We assessed the proposed method on the Mill19 dataset containing thousands of images collected from drone footage over 100,000m<sup id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup> of terrain near an industrial complex and verified its effectiveness.</p>
