<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed a large amount of decentralized data in multiple (edge) devices of end-users, while the aggregation of the decentralized data remains difficult for machine learning jobs due to laws or regulations.
Federated Learning (FL) emerges as an effective approach to handling decentralized data without sharing the sensitive raw data, while collaboratively training global machine learning models.
The servers in FL need to select (and schedule) devices during the training process.
However, the scheduling of devices for multiple jobs with FL remains a critical and open problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-job FL framework to enable the parallel training process of multiple jobs.
The framework consists of a system model and two scheduling methods.
In the system model, we propose a parallel training process of multiple jobs, and construct a cost model based on the training time and the data fairness of various devices during the training process of diverse jobs.
We propose a reinforcement learning-based method and a Bayesian optimization-based method to schedule devices for multiple jobs while minimizing the cost.
We conduct extensive experimentation with multiple jobs and datasets.
The experimental results show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of training time (up to 8.67 times faster) and accuracy (up to 44.6% higher).</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed a large amount of decentralized data over various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile devices, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which can be exploited to train machine learning models of high accuracy for diverse artificial intelligence applications. Since the data contain sensitive information of end-users, a few stringent legal restrictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Official Journal of the European Union <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; CCL <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; CCP <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Chik <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> have been put into practice to protect data security and privacy. In this case, it is difficult or even impossible to aggregate the decentralized data into a single server or a data center to train machine learning models. To enable collaborative training with distributed data, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>)</cite>, which does not transfer raw data, emerges as an effective approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL was first introduced to collaboratively train a global model with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributed on mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>)</cite>.
During the training process of FL, the raw data is kept decentralized without being moved to a single server or a single data center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
FL only allows the intermediate data to be transferred from the distributed devices, which can be the weights or the gradients of a model.
FL generally exploits a parameter server architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smola and Narayanamurthy <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, where a server (or a group of servers) coordinates the training process with numerous devices.
To collaboratively train a global model, the server selects (schedules) a number of devices to perform local model updates based on their local data, and then it aggregates the local models to obtain a new global model.
This process is repeated multiple times so as to generate a global model of high accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While current FL solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>; Pilla <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> focus on a single-task job or a multi-task job <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al. <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, FL with multiple jobs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> remains an open problem. The major difference between the multi-task job and multiple jobs is that the tasks of the multi-task job share some common parts of the model, while the multiple jobs do not have interaction between each other in terms of the model. The multi-job FL deals with the simultaneous training process of multiple independent jobs. Each job corresponds to multiple updates during the training process of a global model with the corresponding decentralized data. While the FL with a single job generally chooses a portion of devices to update the model, the other devices remain idle, and the efficiency is low. The multi-job FL can well exploit diverse devices for multiple jobs simultaneously, which brings high efficiency. The available devices are generally heterogeneous <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, i.e., the computing and communication capability of each device is different, and the data in each device may also differ. During the training process of multiple jobs, the devices need to be scheduled to each job. At a given time, a device can be scheduled to only one job. However, only a portion of the available devices is scheduled to one job in order to reduce the influence of stragglers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>)</cite>. Powerful devices should be scheduled to jobs in order to accelerate the training process, while other eligible devices should also participate in the training process to increase the fairness of data so as to improve the accuracy of the final global models. The fairness of data refers to the fair participation of the data in the training process of FL, which can be indicated by the standard deviation of the times to be scheduled to a job <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pitoura and Triantafillou <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Finkelstein et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.</p>

Based on the data distribution, FL can be classified into three types, i.e., horizontal, vertical, and hybrid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. The horizontal FL addresses the decentralized data of the same features, while the identifications are different. The vertical FL handles the decentralized data of the same identifications with different features. The hybrid FL deals with the data of different identifications and different features. In addition, FL includes two variants: cross-device FL and cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. The cross-device FL trains global machine learning models with a huge number of mobile or IoT devices, while the cross-silo FL handles the collaborative training process with the decentralized data from multiple organizations or geo-distributed datacenters. In this paper, we focus on the horizontal and cross-device FL.</p>

<div id="S3.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Let us assume a scenario where there are multiple FL jobs to be processed at the same time, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, and text generation. These jobs can be trained in parallel so as to efficiently exploit the available devices. However, while each device can only update the model of one job at a given time slot, it is critical to schedule devices to different jobs during the training process.
As the devices are generally heterogeneous, some devices may possess high computation or communication capability while others may not.
In addition, the data fairness of multiple devices may also impact the convergence speed of the training process.
For instance, if only certain powerful devices are scheduled to a job, the model can only learn the knowledge from the data stored on these devices, while the knowledge from the data stored on other devices may be missed. In order to accelerate the training process of multiple jobs with high accuracy, it is critical to consider how to schedule devices while taking into consideration both the computing and communication capability and the data fairness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A straightforward approach is to train each job separately using the mechanism explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017b</a>)</cite>, while exploiting the existing scheduling of single-job FL, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017b</a>)</cite>.
In this way, simple parallelism is considered while the devices are not fully utilized and the system is of low efficiency.
In addition, a direct adaptation of existing scheduling methods to multi-job FL cannot address the efficiency and the accuracy at the same time.
Thus, it is critical to propose a reasonable and effective approach for the multi-job FL.</p>

We design a multi-job FL process as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Efficient Device Scheduling with Multi-Job Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The Server first initializes a global model for each job. The initialization can be realized randomly or from the pre-training process with public data. In order to know the current status of devices, the Server sends requests to available devices in Step ①. Then, in Step ②, the Server schedules devices to the current job, according to a scheduling plan generated from a scheduling method (see details in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Device Scheduling for Multi-job FL ‣ Efficient Device Scheduling with Multi-Job Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). The scheduling plan is a set of devices that are selected to perform the local training process for the current job. Please note that the scheduling process generates a scheduling plan for each job during the training process of multiple jobs, i.e., with an online strategy, while the scheduling processes of multiple jobs are carried out in parallel. The Server distributes the latest global model of the current job to the scheduled devices in Step ③, and then the model is updated in each device based on the local data in Step ④. Afterward, each device uploads the updated model to the Server after its local training in Step ⑤. Finally, Server aggregates the models of scheduled devices to generate a new global model in Step ⑥. The combination of Steps ① - <span id="S3.SSx2.SSSx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">⑥</span> is denoted by a round, which is repeated for each job until the corresponding global model reaches the expected performance (accuracy, loss value, or convergence). Please note that multiple jobs are executed in parallel asynchronously, while a device can only be scheduled to one job at a given time. In addition, we assume that the importance of each job is the same.</p>

The scheduler of RLDS consists of a policy network and a policy converter. In the process of device scheduling, RLDS collects the status information of jobs as the input to the policy network. Then, the policy network generates a list of probabilities on all devices as the output. Finally, the policy converter converts the list into a scheduling plan.</p>

For the non-IID setting of each dataset, the training set is classified by category, and the samples of each category are divided into 20 parts. Each device randomly selects two categories and then selects one part from each category to form its local training set. For the IID setting, each device randomly samples a specified number of images from each training set.
In addition, we use 12 Tesla V100 GPUs to simulate an FL environment composed of a parameter server and 100 devices.

<div id="S5.SSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As RLDS can learn more information with a complex neural network, RLDS outperforms BODS for complex jobs. BODS can lead to high convergence accuracy and fast convergence speed thanks to the emphasis on the combination of the data fairness and the capability of the device, i.e., computation and communication capability. Both RLDS and BODS significantly outperform the baseline methods, while there are also differences among the four methods. The Greedy method is more inclined to schedule the devices with high capability, which leads to a significant decrease in the final convergence accuracy. The Genetic method can exploit randomness to achieve data fairness while generating scheduling plans, and the convergence performance is better than the Greedy method. The FedCS method optimizes the scheduling plan with random selection, which improves the fairness of the device to a certain extent, and the convergence speed is faster than the Random method.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a new Multi-Job Federated Learning framework, i.e., MJ-FL. The framework is composed of a system model and two device scheduling methods. The system model is composed of a process for the parallel execution of multiple jobs and a cost model based on the capability of devices and data fairness. We proposed two device scheduling methods, i.e., RLDS for complex jobs and BODS for simple jobs, to efficiently select proper devices for each job based on the cost model. We carried out extensive experimentation with six real-life models and four datasets with IID and non-IID distribution. The experimental results show that MJ-FL outperforms the single-job FL, and that our proposed scheduling methods significantly outperform baseline methods (up to 44.6% in terms of accuracy, 8.67 times faster for a single job, and 4.67 times faster for the total time).</p>

<div id="Sx1.SSx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to prove the effectiveness of our proposed framework, i.e., MJ-FL, over the Single-Job FL (SJ-FL) approach, we executed each group of jobs sequentially with FedAvg, which is denoted the Random method when adapted to multi-job FL. As shown in Table <a href="#Sx1.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Details of Experimental Setup ‣ Appendix ‣ Efficient Device Scheduling with Multi-Job Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, RLDS with MJ-FL outperforms the FedAvg with SJ-FL, which executes jobs sequentially, up to 5.36 times faster in terms of the training time while achieving the same accuracy. Similarly, the advantage of BODS can be up to 4.68 times faster. In addition, Random within MJ-FL also outperforms SJ-FL up to 0.25 times faster.</p>

We conducted the experiment with different target accuracy, and the advantage is up to 7.63 times faster for Target 1 (0.845), 9.89 times faster for Target 2 (0.856), and 6.98 times faster for Target 3 (0.865), compared with the baselines. We conduct an ablation experiment and find that the data fairness improves both the convergence speed (up to 9.35 times faster) and the accuracy (up to 15.3%). In addition, other scheduling methods, e.g., simulated annealing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Van Laarhoven and Aarts <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>, corresponds to worse performance (up to 91.4% slower and 3.5% lower accuracy), according to our experiments. We carry out experiments to compare other black-box optimization methods (deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zang et al. <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>), of which the performance is worse (up to 90.5% slower and 26.3% lower accuracy) than our methods. Furthermore, we tested other combinations of the two costs, which correspond to worse performance (up to 37.1% slower and 3.5% lower accuracy for the sum of squared costs, and 64.4% slower and 3.3% lower accuracy for multiplication) compared to the linear one (Formula <a href="#S3.E2" title="Equation 2 ‣ Cost Model ‣ Multi-job Federated Learning Framework ‣ 3 System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Efficient Device Scheduling with Multi-Job Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

<p id="Sx1.SSx8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As an FL environment may contain GPUs or other high-performance chips, it is beneficial to train multiple jobs simultaneously to reduce training time while achieving the same accuracy.

Within our framework, the sensitive raw data is kept within each device, while only the models are allowed to be transferred.

<p id="Sx1.SSx8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The BO-based and RL-based methods are designed for different model complexities, and we choose the better one based on known profiling information with small tests (a few epochs) to avoid possible limitations. RLDS favors complex jobs, as it can learn the influence among diverse devices. The influence refers to the concurrent, complementary, and latent impacts of the data in multiple devices for diverse jobs. However, BODS favors simple jobs, while it relies on simple statistical knowledge. The complexity of jobs is determined by the number of parameters of models and the size of the training dataset.</p>
