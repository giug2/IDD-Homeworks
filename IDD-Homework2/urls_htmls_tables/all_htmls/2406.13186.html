<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Multi-stage threats like advanced persistent threats (APT) pose severe risks by stealing data and destroying infrastructure, with detection being challenging. APTs use novel attack vectors and evade signature-based detection by obfuscating their network presence, often going unnoticed due to their novelty. Although machine learning models offer high accuracy, they still struggle to identify true APT behavior, overwhelming analysts with excessive data. Effective detection requires training on multiple datasets from various clients, which introduces privacy issues under regulations like GDPR. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel 3-phase unsupervised federated learning (FL) framework to detect APTs. It identifies unique log event types, extracts suspicious patterns from related log events, and orders them by complexity and frequency. The framework ensures privacy through a federated approach and enhances security using Paillier’s partial homomorphic encryption. Tested on the SoTM 34 dataset, our framework compares favorably against traditional methods, demonstrating efficient pattern extraction and analysis from log files, reducing analyst workload, and maintaining stringent data privacy. This approach addresses significant gaps in current methodologies, offering a robust solution to APT detection in compliance with privacy laws.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cybersecurity threats are advancing in sophistication and relentlessness to an unprecedented degree. Among these threats, multi-stage threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are a formidable category of cyber threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. They are typically orchestrated by well-funded and organized cyber-criminal groups or state-sponsored actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. They steal valuable data, maintain a long-term, covert presence within a targeted network, or destroy the system that it is infecting. Recent examples include the group APT41, which successfully compromised at least six US state government networks between May 2021 and February 2022 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, they have been accused of being involved in a major cyber espionage campaign spotted in 2020 targeting multiple countries such as the USA, France, and Saudi Arabia while targeting many industries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The Lazarus Group was attributed to the “Operation Dream Job”, another cyber espionage campaign first spotted in 2019 targeting important sectors such as defense, aerospace, and government of the USA, Israel, Australia, Russia, and India <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to developing detection techniques and methodologies to identify APT behavior within a network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Machine learning approaches, both supervised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and unsupervised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> are used and combined to detect and classify APT behaviors. These can further be divided into two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based detection. The key difference is that in signature-based detection, events are compared to signatures extracted from previous attacks, and in anomaly-based detection, events within a dataset are compared to each other to detect outliers. However, APT attacks typically make use of unknown vulnerabilities and are designed for their specific use-case, featuring new approaches and malware to covert their presence, rendering signature-based detection to be inadequate for APT detection as they fail to identify novel attack vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. APT detection through classification of benign and malicious APT behaviour suffers from the <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">accuracy paradox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a><span id="S1.p1.1.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span>, as only a very minor amount of data traffic constitutes APT activity within a network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> which leads to models reaching very high accuracy rates despite not being able to spot APT behaviour reliably.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Pattern extraction approaches often yield a substantial number of potentially malicious patterns. This can occur due to different reasons, including the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rare item problem</span> in rule mining-based approaches discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> in which besides rules that belong to rare yet malicious patterns, a large number of irregular yet benign rules are also generated, contributing to the overall volume of patterns. Similarly, in clustering-based approaches like the one outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, every event, whether benign or malicious, is identified as a potentially malicious pattern, all of which require further investigation by a security analyst. Filters that attempt to reduce the number of benign patterns during analysis to reduce the workload also lead to the loss of important contextual <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> data, which is vital for proper security analysis. Publicly available benchmark datasets to evaluate frameworks are often limited or do not exist since privacy concerns and legal considerations constrain the availability of real datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The privacy of system log owners is a critical concern <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. These logs hold sensitive information about an organization’s infrastructure, operations, and sometimes even user-specific details. If this information is exposed, it can lead to serious issues like data breaches or legal problems. Additionally, there are deep ethical considerations regarding the confidentiality of this data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The threat of regulatory non-compliance, highlighted by laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adds another layer of concern. Violating these regulations can result in severe fines, emphasizing the need for a secure handling of log data.
Due to this, researchers often resort to creating artificial datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and while these approaches have their merits, they may not fully capture the intricacies of actual cyber threats and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. This issue makes data extraction methods for APT rely on a central server for subsequent analysis, which causes a single point of failure (SPOF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These limitations make it challenging to develop and test models on data that accurately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world cyber threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> argues that training a powerful deep learning model at a single user is almost impossible, so data from multiple clients is required.
To effectively tackle the challenges outlined, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to extract patterns from network data without prematurely labelling events as benign or malicious. This approach is crucial to preserve vital contextual information and to alleviate the burden on security analysts by filtering excessive data. Additionally, our model’s capability to be trained with multiple datasets enhances its performance, simultaneously adhering to stringent data privacy standards to comply with privacy policies and regulations. Indeed, our framework leverages <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Learning (FL)</span> to decentralize the learning process, enabling distributed data sources to contribute to model training without sharing raw data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This decentralized approach not only enhances privacy but also eliminates the risk of a single point of failure, making the system more robust against potential disruptions.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Much research has been dedicated to unsupervised pattern detection of APTs. However, many of these approaches pose challenges for security analysts<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a 3-phase framework is introduced that extracts APT patterns out of many heterogeneous logfiles, clustering logotypes in Phase 1 and combining all lot entries in Phase 2, where they are then subsequently clustered after shared attributes. Here, they achieved a very high cluster quality during Phase 1 and generated a vast amount of clusters in Phase 2, which need to be analyzed by security analysts.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposes a similar framework but introduces filters to reduce the number of benign patterns extracted; here, the frequency of log-type events is measured, and frequent events are deleted. On average 65% of all log events were filtered out, and significant malicious activity was still retained. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduces association rule mining to rank patterns by a suspicion score based on which mined rules they satisfy, therefore reducing the workload on analysts as malicious patterns are spotted faster without the use of filters. Other deep learning approaches include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, which proposes a combination of several deep learning methods to extract anomalies out of network flow log files and compares them to past attacks using sequential neural networks to subsequently classify them. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">x4</span>]</cite> uses several auto-encoder network methods to distinguish between benign and apt-related anomalies, which are trained on previous attack data. Here, for attacks not included in the network training, with logged events consisting of 19.93% apt related malicious activity have achieved an accuracy of up to 81.77% with a true positive rate of up to 42.00%.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> combines deep neural networks such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze and detect signs of APT attacks in network traffic, in which they classify related IP addresses to be APT or normal IP addresses with an accuracy of 93 to 98%. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> combines LSTM neural networks with association rule mining to extract time sequence and quantization rule features, which are input into deep learning models to detect malware traffic and achieve a 98.36% accuracy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">x5</span>]</cite> introduces an FL-based LSTM framework for APT detection to train the LSTM model across multiple users while preserving the privacy of each user’s dataset.

Participating clients are regarded as honest entities committed to providing genuine data contributions for model training in the form of their model gradients. These gradients may not be disclosed to the server in a way that enables it to infer information about the local datasets. To achieve this, paillier partially homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> is introduced. Here, clients and the central server share an asymmetric key pair consisting of a public key shared with the server and a private key retained by clients. Clients compute their local gradients, which are subsequently encrypted using their private keys before transmission to the central server. Crucially, the server’s operations are constrained to solely performing summations on these encrypted gradients using the public key. The resulting sums are then transmitted back to the clients, who then decrypt the summated gradients and divide the result by the number of participating clients (Figure.<a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-B Design Goals ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

<p id="S4.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data pre-processing is necessary to calculate the dataset’s values, which are not numeric. The data pre-processing step from the original paper is replicated. Log Attributes need to be categorized into three categories: nominal, ordinal, and text data. These attributes undergo a numeric transformation, with nominal attributes being converted into separate Boolean attributes, each corresponding to the presence of a particular value within the attribute. Ordinal attributes are transformed into numerical labels, while text data is processed by applying regular expressions and tokenization to yield numeric representations of unique values (Figure. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Data Pre-processing ‣ IV-A Phase 1: Log-Event Type Classification ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).</p>

The parameter optimization process is described in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ Parameter Optimization ‣ IV-A Phase 1: Log-Event Type Classification ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> takes each log file and calculates optimal values based on the log attributes dimensionality and entry amount. Historically, the default setting for the fuzzifier value has been 2, as it has been observed to yield satisfactory clustering outcomes for a specified cluster count <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Schwämmle et al., however, argue that a much higher quality can be achieved when relating the fuzzifier with the number of entries (N) and dimensionality (D) of a given dataset.

In the context of log event classification, this holds significance, as it profoundly affects both the quality of identified patterns and the quantity of events requiring analysis in Phase 3. Furthermore, the retention of outliers in this approach safeguards against the inadvertent loss of valuable information, a feature not inherent in DBSCAN. Each log entry is then categorized based on its association with a particular cluster, assigning a type to each.</p>

FL adopts a client-server model wherein a global machine-learning model is maintained on the server and subsequently trained on client devices. Subsequently, the computed model from each client is collected by the server and aggregated, which is then redistributed to each client. On each client, the model is again trained on its respective dataset. This iterative process continues until a convergence metric is satisfied, signifying that the newly derived centers exhibit no significant difference from the previous ones. This implementation repeats this step 3 times as Stallman and Wilbik argue that convergence is often met after two iterations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A transaction database for log entries is necessary to extract these patterns, which is achieved by converting a sequential database into one. Initially, a global database is created, encompassing every entry from all log files. This consolidated database incorporates attributes such as DateTime, Phase 1 label, log type, PID, log filename, and original index. These attributes are either shared by all log files or can be readily assigned based on their source of origin; missing PID values will be filled with a 1. The Logtype attribute is distinct for each log type, such as HTTP, system, or network logs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Following this, the DateTime attribute converts the global database into a chronological database format, with entries ordered chronologically. The DateTime and PID attributes are subsequently used to construct a transaction database. This process is executed by employing the DBSCAN clustering on the sequential database, where entries will be clustered based on their DateTime and PID attribute values.
Consequently, each cluster emerges as a sequential assembly of log events near one another regarding time, retaining a similar PID. Each cluster is then transformed into a transaction by representing it as an item set, attributes of which encompass each unique Phase 1 label found within the cluster. These transactions, when combined, constitute the transaction database. Every unique combination of Phase 1 labels is recognized as a pattern within this dataset. Any item-set that precisely embodies this pattern is then identified as an instance of that pattern.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The DBSCAN needs a predefined epsilon parameter, EPS, that defines a n-dimensional shape <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and significantly influences the performance of the DBSCAN clustering. The Knee method is a widely used method to calculate this distance, so it is adopted in this paper to calculate an optimal EPS value. We use the same algorithm as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> (Algorithm .<a href="#alg4" title="Algorithm 4 ‣ Parameter Optimization ‣ IV-B Phase 2: Pattern Extraction ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), which calculates the mean of all distances of each given data point.</p>

item-sets. This formula considers patterns’ complexity by giving more weight to those composed of more unique labels. Additionally, the frequency of each pattern, i.e., how often it appears within the log files, influences its suspicion score. Patterns that occur more frequently are assigned lower suspicion scores than less common ones. The suspicion score assignment is represented in Algorithm <a href="#alg5" title="Algorithm 5 ‣ IV-C Phase 3: Pattern Presentation ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, where it takes each pattern and all transactions generated in Phase 2, assigns transactions to patterns and then calculates the suspicion score for each. Consequently, patterns are sorted based on their suspicion scores, with patterns arranged in descending order from the highest to the lowest score, with each pattern also containing every instance of it in the dataset. An example can be seen in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Parameter Optimization ‣ IV-A Phase 1: Log-Event Type Classification ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A presentation format is introduced to facilitate the easy inspection of item sets that can encompass heterogeneous log files, each with varying attributes. This format encompasses crucial information from each log and is characterized by attributes such as Date, Time, Medium, Message, Message2, SrcIP, DestIP, User, Target, and Label. Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-C Phase 3: Pattern Presentation ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> presents the instances of the pattern by cluster numbers and suspicion by rank. To effectively implement this format, mapping attributes from each log file to the specified attributes is essential. This mapping ensures that the relevant information from different log files can be uniformly represented and easily examined (Figure. 4)</p>

Consequently, the SoTM34 dataset has been selected for the evaluation of the proposed framework. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> provides a labelled version of the dataset that will be used to evaluate the performance of Phase 1 of this framework.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset encompasses a range of malicious activities, with multiple instances of successful compromises within the underlying network. Several shell commands have been executed through a vulnerability associated with an AWSTAT.pl script. This vulnerability allowed threat actors to employ commands like wget and lynx to download payloads onto the target machine. While these events transpired, other potentially malicious activities were documented within the logs, including Multiple password and username guessing attacks, attempts to exploit a glibc bug, two ROOT Logins, and a significant spike in server load. The proposed framework outlined in this paper can detect and identify all of these activities swiftly.</p>

To facilitate accurate pre-processing of log files for machine learning during Phase 1, attributes within the log files are assigned specific prefixes based on the type of data they represent. As per the guidelines provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the following prefixes are employed: “@” for text data, “<math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>” for ordinal categorical data, “$” for IP addresses. No prefix is used for nominal categorical data. The result of this step can be seen in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B Dataset preparations ‣ VI IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Furthermore, feature selection is a critical aspect of the clustering of log entry type identification during Phase 1. The approach outlined by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, emphasizes utilizing features unique to each log type and not shared with other types. This strategy effectively severs the connection between log types and temporal or source occurrences, concentrating solely on the information generated by each log entry and its resemblances to others. Underlined features in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B Dataset preparations ‣ VI IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> have been selected in Phase 1. To accurately present patterns encompassing multiple log files, it’s crucial to map essential features from each log to the global format outlined in section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Phase 3: Pattern Presentation ‣ IV Proposed System ‣ A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-stage Threat Analysis in Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>. This mapping process ensures that relevant log information can be harmoniously integrated and displayed within the standardized format.

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Evaluating the performance of our proposed clustering algorithm as part of the privacy-preserving framework requires careful consideration. Unlike classification algorithms, where precision and recall offer clear measures based on a priori knowledge of actual labels, clustering algorithms necessitate a more nuanced approach. To this end, we employ the following metrics, similar to those used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, to assert the quality of our clustering and allow for comparative analysis:</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a privacy-preserving framework for extracting, scoring, and analyzing APT behaviour, focusing on increasing data privacy and reducing the workload of security analysts while preserving important contextual data without the use of filters. The framework accurately detects and scores patterns, enabling analysts to identify malicious behaviour more efficiently without sifting through the entire dataset, as similar events are grouped within patterns.
Future work can explore alternative cluster validation algorithms to enhance the speed and accuracy of both pure and federated clustering. Additionally, the suspicion score algorithm could be improved by considering the frequency of item sets within the dataset, raising suspicion for events that may occur less frequently but are spaced out over time. There is also room to transform heterogeneous log files into a transaction database. The issue of overlapping events within the same item set can create lengthy, complex, yet benign patterns. Despite their benign nature, these patterns may receive high suspicion scores due to their perceived complexity. This can result in an increased workload for analysts tasked with inspecting these patterns. Addressing this challenge by refining the transformation process could lead to more efficient and accurate pattern extraction and analysis within the framework.</p>
