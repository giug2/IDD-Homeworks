<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising approach for collaboratively training machine learning models using private data partitioned vertically across different parties. Ideally in a VFL setting, the active party (party possessing features of samples with labels) benefits by improving its machine learning model through collaboration with some passive parties (parties possessing additional features of the same samples without labels) in a privacy preserving manner. However, motivating passive parties to participate in VFL can be challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problem of allocating incentives to the passive parties by the active party based on their contributions to the VFL process. We formulate this problem as a variant of the Nucleolus game theory concept, known as the Bankruptcy Problem, and solve it using the Talmud’s division rule. We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it ensures fairness and stability in incentive allocation among passive parties who contribute their data to the federated model. Additionally, we compare our method to the existing solution of calculating Shapley values and show that our approach provides a more efficient solution with fewer computations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Organizations in recent times want to collaborate using data because data has become an increasingly valuable asset for businesses. By collaborating and sharing data, organizations can gain new insights, make better decisions, and identify new opportunities. Collaboration enables organizations to combine data from different sources and systems, and to analyze it in new and innovative ways. Hence, they often opt for aggregating all their data to a central server as a way to facilitate collaboration and gain the benefits of centralized data management. However, traditional centralized machine learning approaches can be problematic due to privacy concerns, scalability issues, and single point of failure risks. To address these issues, distributed machine learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have been developed, which involve training models on decentralized data sources and aggregating the results. This approach allows for better privacy, scalability, and fault tolerance, while still achieving similar or better performance compared to centralized methods. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, a form of distributed learning, solves the problem of centralized learning in organizations by addressing the concern of privacy. One of the main advantages of federated learning is that it allows organizations to train machine learning models on decentralized data without requiring data to be centralized or shared. This protects user privacy and data confidentiality by keeping data on user devices, rather than sending it to a central server for processing. In addition, federated learning can improve model performance by training models on more diverse data, which is particularly useful in organizations where data may be distributed across different locations or business units. Federated learning can be classified into three main types based on how the data is partitioned: horizontal federated learning (HFL), vertical federated learning (VFL), and hybrid federated learning. The choice among the types of FL depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the application.</p>

The objective is to train a global model that can perform well on all samples. A practical example of horizontal federated learning can be in healthcare where multiple hospitals keep their patient data locally and collaboratively train a machine learning model to predict medical conditions. They share only aggregated statistics or model updates with a central server, ensuring privacy preservation while leveraging diverse patient data. The trained model can provide valuable insights for patient diagnosis and treatment across multiple institutions.</p>

The objective is to train a model that can perform well on a joint set of features from all participating devices. For instance, a tax office has information on fraudulent tax returns filed by individuals, but they lack information on financial transactions that could help them identify potential fraudulent activity. To improve their fraud detection predictions, the tax office decides to collaborate with several banks to access transaction data that could help them better identify potential fraudulent activity.</p>

This approach is used when the data is complex and both types of partitioning are required to train an accurate model. An good example of hybrid FL could be a car rental company willing to better predict the demand for their cars at airports collaborates with airline companies to access the number of passengers on flights to those airports. This would require combining data of multiple airlines (horizontal partition) and the car rental company (vertical partition).</p>

</ul>
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Motivating data owners to participate in federated learning is crucial for its success. Incentives help encourage data owners to contribute their data, which is essential for improving model performance through diverse and representative data sources. Shi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a framework in an HFL setting based on the Gale-Shapley value to allocate proper incentives to participants in the federation based on their contributions. After measuring contributions, a reputation-driven reward allocation policy was used to distribute the incentive budget among participants. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a reward system for horizontal federated learning where clients can bid their prices, and a selector chooses clients to participate in FL rounds based on contribution quality. Reputation and payment depend on the quality of contributions, evaluated by a ranking of cosine similarity between client gradients and the final FL model. However, incentive mechanisms in HFL and VFL vary due to differences in the roles of the data owners and goals of the models. Unlike an HFL setting, there are two types of data owners or parties involved in the federation in VFL.</p>

</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="S1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Hence, it is clear that the active party in a VFL is the one who is going to benefit from additional data from the passive parties. Therefore, it is essential for the passive parties to have the motivation to contribute to the learning process with their data. This can be achieved if there is a fair reward allocation mechanism to distribute the profit gained from the federation among the passive parties based on their contribution to the model. In this paper, we propose a method of profit distribution among participants of VFL process based on bankruptcy problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The idea behind the bankruptcy problem is to allocate the bankrupt’s estate in a fair and efficient way, taking into account the private claims of the creditors. The problem arises because the estate may not be sufficient to satisfy all the claims of the creditors, and thus a mechanism needs to be designed that fairly allocates the estate among the creditors based on their claims. In context of VFL, the host parties collaborate with the active party such that the active party is able to maximize the performance of the federated model. The profit from the maximization is then distributed among the passive parties depending on how much they have contributed to the final model.

<br class="ltx_break">The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, related works on incentive mechanisms in federated learning settings have been presented. Section 3 introduces the Bankruptcy problem in general while Section 4 describes our proposed method. The experimental setup is then provided in Section 5 followed by the results in Section 6. Section 7 discusses some issues in VFL that could be solved using the proposed method. Finally, conclusions and future work are discussed in section 8.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some game theory concepts have been experimented with when it came to designing incentive mechanisms in federated learning environments. These approaches had two directions; contribution of participants and payment allocations. Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is the most commonly used technique for evaluating the contribution of the parties in the federation. On the other hand, the Stackelberg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> game is based on data pricing and more focused on allocating monetary rewards to the parties from the profit obtained through the federation.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">2.1.1 </span>Shapley Value</h4>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Shapley value is a concept in cooperative game theory that measures the contribution of each player to the overall value created by a group of players. It is based on the idea that the value generated by a group is distributed fairly among its members according to their respective contributions. It takes into account all possible ways in which players can join a coalition and calculates their average marginal contributions to the coalition. In the context of FL, the Shapley value can be used to measure the marginal contribution of each party to the model performance by evaluating the change in model accuracy when a particular party’s data is included or excluded from the training process. From the computed Shapley value of each party, it is possible to incentivize participation by rewarding parties that contribute the most to the federated model performance.

<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break">Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a Guided Truncation Gradient Shapley (GTG-Shapley) approach for fairly evaluating participants’ contributions to the performance of federated learning models, without exposing their private data. The approach reconstructs FL models from gradient updates for Shapley value calculation and uses a guided Monte Carlo sampling approach combined with truncation to reduce computational costs. Another incentive mechanism has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> for federated learning based on the enhanced Shapley value method. The method measures income distribution by taking multiple influence factors into account as weights, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to find the corresponding weight value of each factor. Although most incentive mechanims are focused in HFL settings, there are some approaches proposed for VFL settings as well. Fan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a contribution valuation metric called <em id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">VerFedSV</em> based on Shapley value for vertical federated learning. The VerFedSV metric satisfies desirable properties for fairness and can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Similarly, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> used Shapley value in VFL to calculate the grouped feature importance of parties through approximation, and used it as a measure of importance to decide the contribution of each party.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Stackelberg game is a non-cooperative game concept in game theory where one player, called the leader, is allowed to make a move before the other player, called the follower, makes their move. The follower observes the leader’s move before making their own, and the leader takes into account the follower’s response when making their initial move. Since Stackelberg game is used to formulate the interactions between different players in the sell or procurement of common products, this makes it more appropriate for the incentive design in FL settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

<br class="ltx_break">Zhan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> formulated the incentive mechanism for federated learning as a two-stage Stackelberg game where the parameter server announces a total reward, and each user determines its training strategy to maximize its own utility. The parameter server is the leader and the data parties are the followers in this game. In the context of VFL, the host parties can be modeled as followers, and the guest party as the leader. The guest party sets a price for each host party based on the value of its data and the importance of its contribution to the global model. Each host then decides whether to participate in the VFL process based on this price. If the price is too low, the host may choose not to participate, while if the price is too high, the organization may choose to keep its data and not share it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Auction theory is a branch of economics that studies how auctions work and how bidders behave in different auction formats. It examines the optimal auction design and rules to maximize the seller’s revenue or social welfare, and analyzes the effects of auctions on efficiency, allocation, and distribution of resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This concept can be applied to federated learning by designing a mechanism for selecting the best models contributed by clients. The mechanism can determine the rewards paid to clients for their contributions and ensure that the contributions are of high quality. 
<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break">A federated learning incentive mechanism has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> which the reputation and reverse auction theory has been applied. In this approach, the participants place bids for tasks, and reputation that acts as an indirect measure of their data quality and reliability. Furthermore, combining their reputation and bids under a limited budget, the participants are rewarded. Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a lightweight and incentive compatible mechanism <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FMore</em> for federated learning in the application of mobile edge computing (MEC) by extending the concept of multi-dimensional procurement auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This incentive mechanism encourages low-cost, high-quality edge nodes to participate in the federated learning process. Moreover, Huong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> also proposed an auction game model in context of MEC for the federated learning service between the base station and mobile users, where the base station is the buyer and mobile users are sellers. The base station initiates and announces the FL task, and the mobile users decide the resources required for model training. Each mobile user submits a bid that includes the resources, local accuracy, and energy cost, and the base station acts as the auctioneer to select the winners and determine the payment.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contract theory is a branch of economics that studies how contracts and incentives can be used to overcome problems of asymmetric information and achieve efficient outcomes. It focuses on the design of contracts that can align the interests of different parties and mitigate risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In federated learning, contract theory can be used to design incentive mechanisms that encourage participants to contribute high-quality data and models to the shared learning process, while also ensuring fairness and privacy protection. This can involve the design of contracts that reward participants for their contributions.
<br class="ltx_break">Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a contract-based aggregator for FL under a multi-dimensional contract model that considers two possible types of agents. The contract-based aggregator incentivizes agents to contribute high-quality data and computational resources by offering them contracts that are individually rational (IR) and incentive compatible (IC). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, data size and communication time of the participants have been considered as decision variables in the contract design for the federated learning process. For this approach, selected participants must satisfy the requirement of communication time and then the incentive design is simplified into a single-dimensional contract problem. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> considered the FL scenario in healthcare crowd sensing transformed the incentive design problem into an utility maximization problem and established an incentive mechanism based on the contract theory. Furthermore, Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> introduced an effective incentive mechanism combining reputation with contract theory to motivate high-reputation participants with high-quality data to participate in model learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, most of the existing approaches for incentive allocation in federated learning deal with horizontally partitioned data, where the data is partitioned based on the samples. In contrast, vertically partitioned data is partitioned based on the features or attributes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that has specifically addressed the incentive allocation problem in vertically partitioned federated learning using game theoretic approaches apart from the Shapley value. This motivated us to propose a novel solution based on the bankruptcy problem with Talmud division where the characteristic function is the model performance gain. The experiments and results in this paper has demonstrated the efficiency of the solution.</p>

Therefore, it can be derived that, by directly solving the bankruptcy problem using Talmud’s division rule, it is possible to determine the specific allocation of estate among the creditors without explicitly constructing the entire bankruptcy game. This simplifies the analysis and allows for a more direct and focused approach to the estate allocation aspect of the bankruptcy scenario.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.11" class="ltx_p">In a VFL setting, the active party has access to the labels while the passive parties have access to additional features of the same samples. During the federation process, the passive parties provide valuable data to the active party which benefits it by improving its machine learning model, but the passive parties are not getting access to the final model or any of the benefits that come with it. Hence, the guest party needs to persuade the passive parties to contribute to the federated model based on incentives. In our proposed method we have designed this scenario as a bankruptcy problem to address the issue of incentive allocation among the participants. In this formulation, the passive parties in the vertical federated learning process are considered as creditors with specific claims on the profit obtained from the federation. The estate is defined as the difference in model performance between the federated model and the local model of the active party. The local model refers to the machine learning model that the active party would have built using only its own data, without collaborating with any other party. The federated model, on the other hand, is the machine learning model that is built collaboratively by all the parties involved in the VFL setup. To calculate the claim of a passive party, we can compare the performance of the federated model when the guest party collaborates only with that particular passive party to the local model of the active party. More specifically, the claim of a passive party can be defined as the improvement in model performance achieved by adding that only that particular party’s features to the federated model.

In this case, all parties receive the same payout of 13.11, which is lower than their claim values. This is because the total surplus value of the federated model is not enough to fully compensate all parties according to their claims. When the estate is relatively small compared to the sum of claims, it is divided equally and all parties receive the same payout. We think this makes sense, as it compensates the effort made for the federation, disregarding the individual contribution.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.p1.4" class="ltx_p">The Shapley value represents the average marginal contribution of each passive party to the overall model performance. It is important to note that the Shapley value and the payout (or nucleolus) may differ due to the specific formulation of the bankruptcy problem in the VFL setting. However, it has been observed across all the datasets (Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.3 Estate and Claims for Bankruptcy Problem ‣ 5 Experimental Setup ‣ Incentive Allocation in Vertical Federated Learning Based on Bankruptcy Problem" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) that, parties with higher claims have higher Shapley values, indicating their higher contribution to the overall model performance. While the Shapley value provides insights into the relative importance of each party’s contribution to the model, it is not sufficient to determine the exact amount of incentive that needs to be allocated to each party.

<br class="ltx_break">While there are efficient algorithms for approximating Shapley values, they may not be appropriate for VFL settings due to the inherent privacy constraints. Approximating Shapley values in VFL requires approximating the performance of the model for all possible combinations of parties, which can be challenging due to the need to maintain data privacy and security.

<br class="ltx_break">
<br class="ltx_break">Moreover, approximations are never exact and can introduce errors in the computation of the Shapley values. These errors can lead to biased incentive allocation and undermine the fairness and efficiency of the VFL collaboration.

The problem of malicious data parties can occur when a participating party intentionally provides data that is of poor quality or contains malicious content that can compromise the integrity of the model. On the other hand, redundant data party problem can occur when multiple participating parties provide similar or redundant data to the federated learning process. This can lead to an inefficient use of resources, as the same data is used multiple times, and can also lead to over-fitting of the model to the redundant data, reducing its ability to generalize to new data.</p>

However, it is important to note that parties with the same Shapley values may not necessarily have the same data, and dropping one of them might not always be the best decision. In some cases, parties with the same Shapley values may be contributing equally to the federated model, even if their data is different. 
<br class="ltx_break">Similarly, in our proposed approach, equal payouts may not necessarily indicate that the claimants have the same data. The equal payouts simply mean that the claimants are receiving a fair share of the model performance gains based on their respective contributions. Therefore, while the symmetry property is an important property in cooperative game theory, it should be used in conjunction with party selection before the VFL process to identify duplicate or similar contributing parties.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the emerging challenges in VFL which is allocating incentives to passive parties in vertically partitioned federated learning has been addressed in our paper. The proposed approach, based on the Bankruptcy Problem using Talmud’s division rule, ensures fairness and stability in incentive distribution among the passive parties. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we have demonstrated that our method is comparable to the existing approach of using Shapley values while also surpasses it in terms of computational efficiency. This efficiency is particularly valuable when dealing with large-scale federated learning scenarios involving numerous parties and features. Overall, our approach presents a practical solution for motivating passive parties to contribute their private data, thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models while preserving privacy. Future research could explore incorporating party selection mechanism in VFL before the training process begins and then finally allocate incentives in the end which would make the whole incentive allocation mechanism more efficient. We will also test this approach on real world use cases in near future.</p>
