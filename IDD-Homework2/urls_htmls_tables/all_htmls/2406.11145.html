<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep generator technology can produce high-quality fake videos that are indistinguishable, posing a serious social threat.
Traditional forgery detection methods directly centralized training on data and lacked consideration of information sharing in non-public video data scenarios and data privacy.
Naturally, the federated learning strategy can be applied for privacy protection, which aggregates model parameters of clients but not original data.
However, simple federated learning can’t achieve satisfactory performance because of poor generalization capabilities for the real hybrid-domain forgery dataset.
To solve the problem, the paper proposes a novel federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation.
The designed Personalized Forgery Representation Learning aims to learn the personalized representation of each client to improve the detection performance of individual client models.
In addition, a personalized federated learning training strategy is utilized to update the parameters of the distributed detection model.
Here collaborative training is conducted on multiple distributed client devices, and shared representations of these client models are uploaded to the server side for aggregation.
Experiments on several public face forgery detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the breakthrough of depth generation technology, face processing technology continues to emerge, resulting in high-quality fake videos that are indistinguishable from the naked eye. Therefore, they are easily abused by malicious users. For example, fake face images are used to deceive system authentication and fraud. Using synthetic fake face images for malicious intrusion, these phenomena are likely to cause serious social security problems. Therefore, detecting fake media content has become a hotspot of research. Although many deep fake detection methods have emerged, they are not effective for video data with large distribution differences in terms of complex sources, forgery methods, and personnel races. This brings great challenges to the face forgery detection task. Therefore, designing a more efficient face forgery detection model has become an important issue faced by the current biometric community and media forensics field.</p>

(a) Traditional forgery detection methods require centralized aggregation of all client data for training, which is detrimental to privacy protection. (b) Traditional federated learning forgery detection method requires uploading all client model parameters to the server side, which prevents learning unique representations from individual clients. (c) Our method can extract personalized representations for complex forgery datasets with diverse types, and upload the shared representation to the server side for updates. In the testing stage, each client leverages its personalized model for local testing.</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing face forgery detection can be roughly divided into two categories: image-based detection methods and video-based detection methods. Image-based detection methods mainly utilize image client artifacts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, mixed boundary information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, RGB images and their advanced semantic information in the frequency domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, etc.
Different from forgery in image detection, video-based methods mainly use the inconsistency between forged video frames for authenticity detection.
Nowadays, the privacy of personal data draws more and more attention.
However, these mentioned traditional forgery detection algorithm lacks considering the privacy of training data.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a),
traditional face forgery detection directly concentrates all client data for training, which can easily lead to the leakage of personal information and have serious consequences.
Naturally, federated learning is a distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning strategy, which is explored in the forgery detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b).
However, related experiment results prove that simple federated learning can’t adapt to real forgery detection scenarios, where there exist different types of forgery clues.
Thus, it is necessary to design a specific federated learning strategy for real forgery detection scenarios.
The designed personalization federated learning is an improved federated learning method that aims to improve the personalized performance and adaptability of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (c), the key challenge is how to disentangle personalized features and shared features in the client when training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the mentioned problem, we propose a federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation.
The proposed method can not only train forgery detection models with distributed non-public data but also improve the detection ability of complex forgery data.
First, considering the diversity of distribution in the forgery dataset with mixed types, personalized forgery representation learning is designed to learn personalized features for client-side forgery types.
Secondly, a personalized federated training strategy is introduced to cyclically update the shared representation of each client under the aggregation of the server, while the personalized part of each client is updated locally based on private data.
In this framework, model parameters trained on clients are shared and aggregated, while training data on individual clients remains private, thus protecting the security of the data.</p>

Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> found that forged images usually contain some distortion and blurring effects, thus proposing a more challenging face forgery detection method. Qian et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> applied DCT transform technology to images to collect frequency-aware clues, which can be used to further mine subtle artifacts in images.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent work treats deepfake detection as a video-level prediction problem and learns video-level features. Temporal features are often combined with spatial features for video forgery detection. Gu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed using a spatiotemporal discontinuity learning module to jointly learn the inconsistencies between single frames and consecutive frames in deepfake videos, respectively.

With the further development of face forgery detection technology, the author <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> designed a video classifier based on physiological signal change synthesis to detect the authenticity of videos. Ganiyusufoglu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> used a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to model spatio-temporal features to capture the similarities between different deepfakes and further improve cross-domain fake video detection capabilities. However, these mentioned methods lack considering the privacy of training data.
Peng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> observed the difference in gaze direction pattern distribution between real videos and fake videos, so they proposed to use a gaze analysis model to analyze the gaze features of face video frames and then applied a spatiotemporal feature aggregator to achieve gaze feature-based authenticity classification.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a forgery cue enhancement network based on discrete cosine transform to achieve a more comprehensive representation of spectral-spatial and temporal features and make full use of the rich information in video sequences.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, people’s requirements for data privacy and security are becoming more and more stringent, thus promoting the development of the field of federated learning. Most existing federated learning training methods are derived from the federated averaging algorithm, which aims to train a well-performing global model. McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed a federated learning algorithm for the first time, which can complete the weighted aggregation update of the model without direct contact with the training data. The optimization method of Yoshida et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> is to make the server select client data to form a dataset that approximates IID. Sprague et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed a new asynchronous federated learning algorithm and applied it to image-based geolocation. Recently, W. Hongyi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and others proposed a federated matching average algorithm, which uses coordinate weighted averaging and the arrangement invariance of network neurons to improve it. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> used residual federated learning and combined it with variational autoencoders to learn robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect face forgery cues.
However, these mentioned methods have poor generalization capabilities for the complex forgery datasets with diverse types.
This paper proposes a personalized representation learning method. Each client improves the generalization of the algorithm by extracting personalized representations further exploring more robust face forgery clues of multiple distributed client models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.16" class="ltx_p">Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, we consider using personalized federated learning methods when processing data from complex forgery datasets with diverse types. In order to further explore more robust face forgery clues, we design a novel federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation. The personalized forgery representation learning framework can disentangle shared features and personalized features. Personalized features contain more suitable properties of the client data set, further improving the applicability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types. Additionally, the captured shared representation information further explores more robust face forgery clues by aggregating updates on the server side. As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Motivation ‣ III Proposed Approach ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the personalized forgery representation learning framework is designed to simulate data from complex sources in real scenarios.

Client data cannot be exchanged or transferred between clients. Clients train their own face forgery detection models locally. Since the data is a complex forged dataset with various types, traditional federated learning forgery detection directly concentrates all client parameters for training, which can easily lead to the inability to learn local personalized information and result in poor generalization ability. Therefore, uploading the shared representation of each client to the weighted average on the server side can not only ensure the privacy of the data but also improve the generalization ability of complex forged datasets with various types. Moreover, the designed personalized forgery representation learning framework can disentangle shared features and personalized features. Personalized features contain more suitable properties of the client data set, further improving the applicability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.9" class="ltx_p">Considering that complex forged datasets with various types on the client will have a negative impact on traditional federated learning forgery detection. The key to personalized federated learning is to extract personalized representations of models trained by clients with complex forgery datasets with diverse types, as well as shared representation of multiple distributed client models. Therefore, we designed a novel federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation. The framework of methods is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Motivation ‣ III Proposed Approach ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The client model consists of three parts: feature extractor, personalized feature extractor, and shared feature extractor.

This is because the designed personalized forgery representation learning can explore more robust face forgery clues.

Thanks to the designed personalized forgery representation learning, our proposed method achieves optimal performance in both auc and accuracy metrics. For example, compared with RFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, the accuracy of our method exceeds 3.99% and the auc exceeds 0.76%.

To demonstrate that our proposed method can extract personalized representations of customers, we conducted cross-validation experiments on four subtypes included in the fake source hybrid dataset, and the results are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-D Algorithm Analysis ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. It can be seen from Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-D Algorithm Analysis ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> that the color of the diagonal part is the darkest, and the rest of the color is lighter. For example, the personalized model is trained on the client holding the CelebDF-v2 data set, where the forgery detection accuracy of the local client can reach 89.90% on the CelebDF-v2 data set.
But the detection accuracy for other clients’ data FF++_DF, FMFCC-V and WildDeepfake is poor. The same is true for other clients. This also proves that the personalized features contain more suitable properties of the client data set, further improving the applicability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types.</p>

Without personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 84.29%. The accuracy rate performance index dropped by 5.61%.
Taking the subset of FaceForensics++ (Referred to as FF++_DF) data set as an example, with personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 94.81%. Without personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 94.12%. The accuracy rate performance index dropped by 0.69%.
Taking the FMFCC-V data set as an example, with personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 99.60%. Without personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 99.36%. The accuracy rate performance index dropped by 0.24%.
Taking the WildDeepfake data set as an example, with personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 70.81%. While without personalized federated learning, the face forgery detection accuracy is 70.05%. The accuracy rate performance index dropped by 0.76%.
It can be seen that without leveraging personalized federated learning, individual clients show poor detection performance due to the lack of shared representation of multiple distributed client models.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation, which further explores more robust face forgery clues by combining the shared representation of multiple distributed client models. Furthermore, to improve the applicability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types, the designed personalized forgery representation learning framework can disentangle shared features and personalized features. The personalized features contain more suitable properties of the client data set, further improving the applicability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types. We conducted experiments on public face forgery detection datasets, and the experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively improve the generalization ability of complex forgery datasets with diverse types while protecting privacy. In the future, we will explore extending the personalized federated learning method to cross-modal forgery detection problems, such as combining image and voice information for forgery detection. Through the fusion of cross-modal information and federated learning, the performance and robustness of forgery detection can be further improved. Furthermore, the application of personalized representation in other fields is also worth studying.</p>
