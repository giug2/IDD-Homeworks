<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices and networks have raised concerns about the loss of control over personal data and research advance towards the trade-off between privacy and utility in scenarios that combine exchange communications, big databases and distributed and collaborative (P2P) Machine Learning techniques. On the other hand, although Federated Learning (FL) provides some level of privacy by retaining the data at the local node, which executes a local training to enrich a global model, this scenario is still susceptible to privacy breaches as membership inference attacks. To provide a stronger level of privacy, this research deploys an experimental environment for FL with Differential Privacy (DP) using benchmark datasets. The obtained results show that the election of parameters and techniques of DP is central in the aforementioned trade-off between privacy and utility by means of a classification example.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) offers a useful paradigm for training a Machine Learning (ML)
model from data distributed across multiple data silos, eliminating the need for raw
data sharing as it has the ambition to protect data privacy through distributed learning
methods that keep the data local. In simple terms, with FL, it is not the data that moves
to a model, but it is a model that moves to data, which means that training is happening
from user interaction with end devices. Federated Learning’s key motivation is to provide
privacy protection as well as there has recently been some research into combining the
formal privacy notion of Differential Privacy (DP) with FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Instead of researching on the traditional FL model, we consider working on a peer-to-peer
approach to FL or decentralized FL framework, where any node can play the role of model
provider and model aggregator at different times. That is being applied depending on various
aspects related to the communication infrastructure and the distribution of the data. For
example, considering a traditional FL model where the aggregator is unavailable for some period.
In a peer-to-peer approach, the aggregator role can be played by a different node. Also, it can
be decided from time to time that the aggregator node is the one with more connections in the
network, or whatever other criteria that allows the learning process to be improved. So, every
node in the network has the capability of being a model provider and an aggregator node, and it
plays different roles in different rounds of the learning process according to the state of the
infrastructure. However, under this scenario, where the communication infrastructure cannot be
considered reliable and secure, additional privacy measures are required. In a decentralized FL
system, while the data is kept local and not exchanged with peers, the model parameters could be
observed by malicious or curious agents and be used to infer knowledge about the datasets or the
aggregated model. To tackle this problem, a DP mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> can be
introduced into the distributed learning environment, so that inference attacks are harder.
However, as DP adds controlled noise to the information exchanged by the nodes, it might affect
the learning rate and accuracy of the algorithm. This trade-off has been considered in some works
for classical (centralized, single-server) FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Cao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
In this paper, we study experimentally the interplay between DP and the learning performance in
a distributed FL system.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the scientific literature, a number of studies have discussed on distributed ML, FL,
and privacy preserving machine learning. Reading diverse existing literature’s application,
benefits, and drawbacks is one of the most significant elements of study, we discovered that FL
is a relatively new topic with limited published literature and articles, but much research has
already been conducted in the areas of privacy-preserving learning and distributed machine learning
algorithms or the Traditional Centralized Federated Learning which the role of the server goes to
one role until convergence.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>, the authors compared two different variants of clipping
for FedAvg: clip the client model vs. clip the client model difference (CE-FedAvg), considering
not all the clients participate in each round of communication. Here some conducted
experiments for FedAvg, CE-FedAvg and DP-FedAvg with different models namely MLP, AlexNet, Resnet,
MobilNetV2, on two different benchmark Dataset EMNIST and Cifar-10 for Classification, and local
data distribution which falls into two ways; 1) IID Data setting where the samples are uniformly
distributed to each client 2) Non-IID Data setting, where the clients have unbalanced samples.
The results showed that the performance depends on the structures of the neural network being used
and the heterogeneity data distribution among clients is one of the main causes of the different
behavior between the clipped and unclipped.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed algorithms based on differentially private
SGD (DP–SGD) that add Gaussian noises to each computed gradient and then clip the noised gradient
(NC), which is different to the conventional method in the sequence of clipping gradient and
adding noise (CA). The experimental settings to verify the performance consider different
factors, as the training of two popular deep learning models, (CNN and LSTM) on three
different datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR10, SVH, respectively, and adoption of two gradient
descent optimization methods (SGD and Adam) for evaluation, with the inclusion of
Gaussian noise and clipping. This work also proposes a new privacy protection metric called
”Total Parameters Value Difference” to measure the privacy protection capability and examine
how the impact of adding noise in the training process will affect the model itself. The
results showed and validated the effectiveness of their proposed method (AC), which
improves remarkably the accuracy of the model when other parameter settings are the same.
However, the TPVD of AC are lower than those of CA. The results showed proposed a
modification of AC, as showed changing the sequence of adding noise and clipping can
achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence that outperforms the conventional method even
under different parameter settings and the TPVD metric proposed in this paper as a
privacy protection metric for DL models can better reflect the perturbation effects.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Choudhury et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, the authors introduced a FL framework, with the
proposed method of DL to add noise to the objective function of the optimization at each site
to produce a minimizer of the perturbed objective. The proposed model is tested on two
different datasets for two major tasks ;(1) prediction of adverse drug reaction (ADR),
Dataset used Limited MarketScan Explorys Claims-EMR Data (LCED); (2) prediction of mortality
rate, dataset using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) data. The results
show that although DL offers a strong level of privacy, it deteriorates the predictive capability
of the produced global models due to the excessive amount of noise added during the distributed
FL training process, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wei et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> the authors proposed a novel framework
based on the concept of DP, in which artificial noises are added to the parameters
at the clients side before aggregating, namely, noising before model aggregation FL (NbAFL),
the proposed NbAFL evaluated by using multi-layer perception (MLP) on MNIST dataset, they
found that there is an optimal K that achieves the best convergence performance at a fixed privacy
level.</p>

called collaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with
less reliance on a central controller to facilitate the deployment in IOT
applications. The concept of the proposed Framework based on this study where
some devices are directly connected to the Base station, while others are
associated with a certain number of neighboring devices. The main objective
was to overcome the challenge of energy limitations or a potentially high
transmission delay. In order to overcome the short comings of the reviewed
literature, the main objective of the approach proposed in this paper is to
conduct an experimental framework to investigate the interaction between DP
and learning performance in a distributed FL system.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated averaging (FedAvg) is a communication efficient algorithm for distributed training

in which multiple clients collaborate to solve machine learning problems, with a central
aggregator overseeing the process. This setting decentralizes the training data, ensuring that
each device’s data is secure. Federated learning is based on two key principles: local computing
and model transmission, which mitigates some of the privacy risks and costs associated with
standard centralized machine learning methods. The client’s original data is kept on site and
cannot be transferred or traded. Each device uses local data for local training, then uploads
the model to the server for aggregation, and finally, the server transmits the model update to
the participants to achieve the learning goal.</p>

algorithms. so, each provider’s/client’s model update needs have a bounded norm, which is
ensured by applying an operation that shrinks individual model updates when their norm exceeds
a given threshold. To create FL algorithms that protect DP is to know that clipping impacts a
FL algorithm’s convergence performance. There are two major clipping strategies used for FL
algorithms, one is local model clipping which consists in the clients directly clipping the
models sent to the server; the other is difference clipping, where the local update difference
between the initial model and the output model i clipped.</p>

whether the node applies differential Privacy when obtaining/updating the local Model. Also,
the rounding process is updated, so that the perturbation mechanisms (DP) are added to the
local updates for a subset of nodes. In order for the perturbation mechanism to have formal
privacy guarantees, each local update needs to have a bounded norm, which is ensured by applying
a clipping operation that reduces the clients’ individual model updates when their norm exceeds a
given threshold. The network and communication model are depicted in Figures <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.4. Proposed Framework of P2P FL with DP ‣ 3.

standard FL, with and without DP at the clients, performance is homogeneous across all the
clients, which attain similar performance. This is simply an indication that the data have been
split uniformly without bias among the clients. Note also that, when DP is introduced

and that the tuning of DP needs to be carefully set depending on the statistical distribution of
the data. We also confirm experimentally that DP has a substantial impact on accuracy, and can
therefore make convergence quite slow in FL.</p>

the traditional methods. We have compared as well different approaches to ML according to privacy:
1) Centralized FL (reduction of the P2P model where the aggregator is the same in all rounds); 2)
P2P FL (decentralized); 3) DP Centralized ; 4) DP P2P FL.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Strong privacy requirements in FL among a fully decentralized set of agents can be achieved by
adapting the natural solution of introducing DL at the clients in each communication and
computing round. However, in contrast to the well-studied case of a FL approach with DP in the
scenarios of a single and central aggregator, the peer-to-peer interactions during all the
learning cycle (including local learning, noise injection and distribution of the models) is
more complex and still not understood. In this respect, the work in this paper are a first
experimental attempt at getting some insight into this interplay FL vs. DP vs. communications.</p>
