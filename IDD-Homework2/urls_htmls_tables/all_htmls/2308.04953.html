<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has found many successes in wireless communications; however, the implementation of FL has been hindered by the energy limitation of mobile devices (MDs) and the availability of training data at MDs. Wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile crowdsensing (MCS) are promising technologies that can be leveraged to power energy-limited MDs and acquire data for learning tasks. However, how to integrate WPT and MCS towards sustainable FL solutions is a research topic entirely missing from the open literature. This work for the first time investigates a resource allocation problem in collaborative sensing-assisted sustainable FL (S2FL) networks with the goal of minimizing the total completion time. In particular, we investigate a practical harvesting-sensing-training-transmitting protocol in which energy-limited mobile devices first harvest energy from RF signals, use it to gain a reward for user participation, sense the training data from the environment, train the local models at mobile devices, and transmit the model updates to the edge server. The total completion time minimization problem of jointly optimizing power transfer, transmit power allocation, data sensing, bandwidth allocation, local model training, and data transmission is complicated due to the non-convex objective function, highly non-convex constraints, and strongly coupled variables.
We propose a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm to obtain the optimal solution via the decomposition technique. In particular, inner convex approximations are developed for the resource allocation subproblem, and the subproblems are performed alternatively in an iterative fashion. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed S2FL algorithm in reducing the completion time up to 21.45% in comparison with other benchmark schemes. Further, we investigate an extension of our work from frequency division multiple access (FDMA) to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and show that NOMA can speed up the total completion time 8.36% on average of the considered FL system.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence (AI) has found many successes in various engineering disciplines, of which future wireless communications are a notable area <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The increasing usage of AI techniques has been seen as a key to solving various challenging problems in 5G networks that are difficult to be handled by conventional optimization approaches, as well as meeting technical requirements in future 6G networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT). It has been shown that AI techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, can be used to solve various challenging problems in wireless communications that are hardly handled by conventional optimization techniques. However, conventional AI techniques require mobile devices (MDs) to share their data with a learning server for centralized storage and learning, which, however, results in significant issues of communication bottleneck, storage availability, and especially data privacy. Federated learning (FL) has been considered a promising AI technique to overcome these issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Unlike conventional AI techniques, FL aims to build a collaborative learning model by allowing MDs to share their model updates instead of raw data, thus enhancing data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As such, there is an increasing interest in making use of FL in wireless networks, such as vehicular networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, cybersecurity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and wireless resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, vanilla FL frameworks are severely limited by the energy limitation of MDs (e.g., sensors and wearable devices) and the data available for local training. To overcome these hurdles, it is extremely promising to integrate FL with key-enabling technologies of future wireless networks like wireless power transfer (WPT) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to enhance the energy capacities of energy-limited MDs and thus increase the FL performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed to dispatch an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the learning server in FL and as the aerial energy source in WPT. These studies show that aerial FL helps to improve the network performance compared with the benchmarks, especially when the placement of the learning server is predefined. WPT-aided FL was also investigated in recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, A WPT and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided FL system was considered, where each learning round consists of four phases, including WPT, local training, non-orthogonal transmission, and model aggregation. Following that, a layered algorithm was proposed to optimize the transmit power of the edge server, time allocation, processing rates, and local training accuracy so as to minimize the energy-latency trade-off objective. Motivated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> studied a long-term optimization problem of user scheduling, power allocation, and power splitting factor, which is then solved by an actor-critic reinforcement learning method. However, unlike WPT in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, SWIPT was adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to allow the edge server to broadcast the global model and wirelessly power MDs simultaneously. Different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which fixes the time of the four phases, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed to optimize the time of the SWIPT phase and NOMA transmission phase.
However, these prior studies were based on the assumption that the data is available for local training at MDs. With the growing sensing capabilities of MDs, it is apparent that MDs can sense data from the environment, which becomes available for training local models. Nevertheless, the sensing data for FL demands a novel design of properly allocating time for different learning phases, along with communication and computation resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has been a key technology for the future Internet that allows MDs to perform data sensing, computing, and communication tasks in order to complete more complex tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. With multi-access edge computing (MEC) deployment, computing resources are made available at the network edge, and the sensing data can be offloaded to a server for remote processing. Conventionally, the sensing data is collected by centralized AI algorithms to build intelligent MCS systems, thus raising the data privacy issue. In this regard, FL not only enables intelligent collaborative sensing systems but also helps to preserve the data privacy of MDs. Moreover, resource allocation optimization has shown a critical role in improving the performance of MCS systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a novel aggregation method in FL-enabled MCS systems to address the system’s significant issues of appropriate selection of heterogeneous MDs and lack of privacy-preserving methods.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a hybrid incentive method based on a reverse Vickrey auction and a posted pricing mechanism was proposed to promote the participation of MDs as workers in MCS systems. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a blockchain-enabled FL-MCS network was investigated, in which blockchain and differential privacy are employed to decentralize and secure the transmission of the global model and local model updates. More recently, studies on joint data sensing, computing, and communication are investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which confirm the superiority of the joint framework over baselines with disjoint considerations.
It is worth noting that prior studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> mainly focus on leveraging FL to improve data privacy or edge computing resources to process heterogeneous sensing data in MCS and ignore the usage of collaborative sensing for FL via a joint power transfer, data sensing, model training, and communication framework. It is a relatively unexplored research question about how to leverage WPT and MCS for FL and how to optimize the resource allocation problem in such FL networks with the objective of minimizing the total completion time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, designing efficient transmission to share model updates from MDs to the edge server is a crucial issue in FL. In this regard, prior studies have adopted OMA, NOMA, or both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. From the optimization perspective, NOMA consistently achieves a better sum rate than conventional OMA techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>; however, that observation may not hold for MEC and FL systems with different performance metrics. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> considered optimizing the total energy consumption and the total completion time in FDMA-based FL networks and showed that FDMA is mostly superior to time-division multiple access (TDMA), which may outperform FDMA in terms of the computation energy consumption in case of the high power budget of MDs. The works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> investigated the optimization problem of computation offloading in MEC systems with two kinds of offloading schemes: NOMA and TDMA. These studies show that TDMA can be superior to NOMA under specific scenarios of identical sensing rates in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and flexibly optimized beamforming design in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> studied the completion time minimization problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided FL networks with two multiple access schemes, including frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and NOMA. Simulation results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> exhibit that the NOMA-FL system experiences a shorter completion time than the FDMA-FL system, while RIS further helps to reduce the completion time compared with ones without RIS.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As aforementioned, an efficient FL implementation is constrained by MDs’ limited battery capacity and training data availability. WPT and MCS are two promising technologies to overcome these deficiencies so as to enable intelligent IoT services and applications in future wireless systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, the study of integrating WPT and MCS towards sustainable FL solutions is a research topic entirely missing from the open literature. <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Different from prior studies that assume the availability of training data, the sensing process is integrated into FL networks to exploit the growing sensing capabilities of MDs in this paper</span>. To this end, we aim to investigate a sensing-assisted sustainable FL (called S2FL) scenario with the implementation of the four-phase of “harvesting-sensing-training-transmitting”. Specifically, in our investigated S2FL system, an operator-deployed edge server collocated with an access point employs WPT to wirelessly power MDs in the first phase. After receiving harvested energy as a reward, the MDs are incentivized to contribute to the learning process by using the rest of harvested energy to sense data, train local models, and share local model updates. Further, FDMA-based transmission and an extension to the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) counterpart are considered for the communication between MDs and the edge server. Under this design, it is crucial to properly allocate the time for WPT, sensing, local training, and transmission because of a tight coupling among the learning phases. It is also important to take into account the processing rates of MDs (i.e., central processing unit (CPU) frequencies), their transmit power, power transfer, and bandwidth partitioning. Following the aforementioned considerations, the completion time minimization problem is formulated in this paper, and an efficient path-following algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. In summary, notable contributions and features offered by this work are summarized as follows:</p>

To settle these issues, we investigate a practical scenario in FL networks when the MDs first harvest energy from the energy source via RF signals, then leverage it to gain a reward, sense data from the environment, next train local models using the sensing data, and use residual energy to share local model updates with the learning server. Considering these aspects, the four-phase “harvesting-sensing-training-transmitting” protocol is proposed to design the S2FL framework.</p>

However, obtaining the globally optimal solution for the problem is computationally challenging because of its non-convexity and a tight coupling among optimization variables. As such, we devise a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm to effectively deal with the non-convexity issue and obtain the optimal solution. In particular, we propose to decompose the original problem into subproblems of resource allocation and local model accuracy and develop inner convex approximations to generate the convex programs of these two problems. The algorithm is then designed in the alternative fashion of updating the local model accuracy and solving the convex approximated resource allocation problem.</p>

Unlike the OMA case, MDs are allowed to use the entire bandwidth resource for communication with the edge server, and the bandwidth allocation is thus not needed to be considered, but the optimization problem is still highly non-convex. By leveraging the decomposition technique and inner convex approximations as in the OMA case, we then propose a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm for the S2FL problem in the NOMA case.</p>

In particular, we provide sub-optimal schemes for the S2FL problem, including fixed training data, given model accuracy, proportional power transfer, and equal bandwidth allocation. Through a set of simulation results under various network settings, we show that the proposed S2FL can significantly minimize the total completion time compared with the benchmark schemes.

Due to the limited battery capacity, MDs may not have sufficient energy to complete the FL process. To overcome this issue, radio frequency (RF)-based energy harvesting is a promising approach that allows MDs to harvest external energy from RF signals transmitted by the access point. Therefore, each MD can participate in and perform the FL process based on the energy converted from the received RF signals.
In addition, unlike vanilla FL, which assumes the availability of data for local model training at MDs, this work considers a more practical scenario, where MDs with sensing capabilities can sense and then collect the data from the surrounding environment before training their local models. For example, biosensors can be utilized to sense healthcare data, and cameras embedded in MDs can be used to collect image data.</p>

Moreover, for the sake of the joint power transfer, data sensing, model training, and transmission framework proposed in this work, we consider a synchronous design with a certain degree of synchronization among MDs. An asynchronous design may allow MDs to have more flexibility in performing the four phases in S2FL, and this design is left for future work.</p>

Note that the sensing data is used for local training at MDs and is not shared with the server for centralized storage and training. In this way, data collected externally is only exploited for local training purposes while its privacy is enhanced via the use of FL. Furthermore, it is noted that the design problem of optimizing the data sensing time is equivalent to one that optimizes the sensing data of all MDs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Thus, this work can be readily extended to an interesting scenario where the sensing data sizes of MDs are considered.</p>

Nevertheless, too large training data at an FL iteration (i.e., batch) may not achieve as good performance as one can do with small training data and also greatly increases the local computing time and energy consumption.

For example, there is a coupling between the local model accuracy and the time allocation variables, which makes the objective function non-convex.
For the constraints, the transmission time, the bandwidth allocation, and the transmit power are coupled in (<a href="#S2.E12.4" title="In 12 ‣ II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II Preliminaries and Problem Formulation ‣ Wirelessly Powered Federated Learning Networks: Joint Power Transfer, Data Sensing, Model Training, and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12d</span></a>), and thus (<a href="#S2.E12.4" title="In 12 ‣ II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II Preliminaries and Problem Formulation ‣ Wirelessly Powered Federated Learning Networks: Joint Power Transfer, Data Sensing, Model Training, and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12d</span></a>) is a non-convex constraint.
As such, no globally optimal solution, in general, can solve the problem efficiently. To this end, we develop a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm for the S2FL problem in (<a href="#S2.E12" title="In II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II Preliminaries and Problem Formulation ‣ Wirelessly Powered Federated Learning Networks: Joint Power Transfer, Data Sensing, Model Training, and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>). Beforehand, it should be noted that the constraint on the sensing data size (<a href="#S2.E12.6" title="In 12 ‣ II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II Preliminaries and Problem Formulation ‣ Wirelessly Powered Federated Learning Networks: Joint Power Transfer, Data Sensing, Model Training, and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12f</span></a>) is active at the MD with the slowest sensing rate; because otherwise, one can always reduce the sensing time until the constraint holds for all MDs and thus reduces the total completion time and learning overhead.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">NOMA has been considered a key technology in future wireless networks. The notion behind the NOMA technique is to allow multiple users to share the same resources; therefore, NOMA offers various advantages (e.g., higher spectral efficiency, better cell-edge throughput, and lower transmission latency) over conventional OMA schemes like FDMA. In this section, to answer the question “can NOMA help to reduce the total completion time in the S2FL system,” we consider employing NOMA for the transmission of local model updates from MDs to the edge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.5" class="ltx_p">In the NOMA case, MDs can transmit the local model updates simultaneously, and the edge server decodes the received signal based on the successive interference cancellation (SIC) order. More specifically, in the uplink power-domain NOMA, signals from MDs are transmitted to the receiver (i.e., access point), where the SIC step is performed. Without loss of generality, the decoding order is the decreasing order of the channel gain qualities, as assumed in many prior studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, we add a note that other decoding order strategies are still applicable, which is out of the research scope of this work. The channel gains are ordered as <math id="S4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="h_{1}\geq h_{2}\geq\ldots\geq h_{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">h</mi><mn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">≥</mo><msub id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml">h</mi><mn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">≥</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.7" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml">≥</mo><msub id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.2.cmml">h</mi><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.3" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.3.cmml">N</mi></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><and id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"></and><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1b.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><geq id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"></geq><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2">ℎ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2">ℎ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3">2</cn></apply></apply><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1c.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><geq id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.5"></geq><share href="#S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1d.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"></share><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.6">…</ci></apply><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1e.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><geq id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.7"></geq><share href="#S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1f.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"></share><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.2">ℎ</ci><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.8.3">𝑁</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">h_{1}\geq h_{2}\geq\ldots\geq h_{N}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Note that this work aims to develop a synchronous design of the S2FL system while FDMA and NOMA are employed for the transmission phase of all MDs. Therefore, the results in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-C Performance Comparison in S2FL: OMA vs NOMA ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Wirelessly Powered Federated Learning Networks: Joint Power Transfer, Data Sensing, Model Training, and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> evidently demonstrate the performance superiority of NOMA over FDMA in data transmission when both are equipped with the optimal resource solutions in the considered synchronous S2FL network. It is promising to consider extension scenarios when MDs may have different time durations of the sensing, training, and transmission phases (i.e., asynchronous designs). As such, FMDA, with the ability to ensure asynchronicity for MDs, may also outweigh the performance of its synchronous counterpart and the NOMA-enabled scheme. We leave this exciting research for future work.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work has investigated the S2FL framework by leveraging MDs’ data sensing and energy harvesting capabilities. Notably, the proposed S2FL framework enables energy-limited MDs to wirelessly harvest energy from the energy source and collect the sensing data from the environment for local training. Following the S2FL framework, a computationally-efficient path-following algorithm has been proposed to solve the computationally challenging non-convex problem in S2FL. We have shown that the proposed algorithm provides a significant reduction in total completion time compared with a set of benchmark schemes under various network settings. We have also shown that adopting NOMA as the multiple access technique helps further reduce the total completion time of the considered S2FL network.</p>
