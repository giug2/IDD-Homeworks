<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Since edge device failures (i.e., anomalies) seriously affect the production of industrial products in Industrial IoT (IIoT), accurately and timely detecting anomalies is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, data collected by the edge device may contain the user’s private data, which is challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new communication-efficient on-device federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-<span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50% compared to the federated learning framework that does not use gradient compression scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread deployment of edge devices in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm has spawned a variety of emerging applications with edge computing, such as smart manufacturing, intelligent transportation, and intelligent logistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The edge devices provide powerful computation resources to enable real-time, flexible, and quick decision making for the IIoT applications, which has greatly promoted the development of Industry 4.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, the IIoT applications are suffering from critical security risks caused by abnormal IIoT nodes which hinders the rapid development of IIoT. For example, in smart manufacturing scenarios, industrial devices acting as IIoT nodes, e.g., engines with sensors, that have abnormal behaviors (e.g., abnormal traffic and irregular reporting frequency) may cause industrial production interruption thus resulting in huge economic losses for factories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Edge devices (e.g., industrial robots), generally collect sensing data from IIoT nodes, especially time-series data, to analyze and capture the behaviors and operating condition of IIoT nodes by edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, these sensing time series data can be used to detect the anomaly behaviors of IIoT nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the abnormality problems from IIoT devices, typical methods are to perform abnormal detection for the affected IIoT devices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Previous work focused on utilizing deep anomaly detection (DAD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> approaches to detect abnormal behaviors of IIoT devices by analyzing sensing time series data. DAD techniques can learn hierarchical discriminative features from historical time-series data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks-based deep learning model to achieve anomaly detection in sensing time series data. Munir <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a novel DAD approach, called DeepAnT, to achieve anomaly detection by utilizing deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict anomaly value. Although the existing DAD approaches have achieved success in anomaly detection, they cannot be directly applied to the IIoT scenarios with distributed edge devices for timely and accurate anomaly detection. The reasons are two-fold: (i) the most of detection models are not flexible enough in traditional approaches, the edge devices lack dynamic and automatically updated detection models for different scenarios, and hence the models fail to accurately predict frequently updated time-series data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; (2) due to privacy concerns, the edge devices are not willing to share their own collected time-series data with each other, thus the data exists in the form of “islands.” The data islands significantly degrade the performance of anomaly detection. Furthermore, it is often overlooked that the data may contain sensitive private information, which leads to potential privacy leakage. There are some privacy issues in the anomaly detection context. For example, the anomaly detection model will reveal the patient’s heart disease history when detecting the patient’s abnormal pulse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, a promising on-device privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm, called on-device federated learning (FL), was proposed for edge devices to train a global DAD model while keeps the training datasets locally without sharing raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Such a framework allows edge devices to collaboratively train an on-device DAD model without compromising privacy. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed an on-device FL-based approach to achieve collaborative anomaly detection. Tsukada <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> utilized FL framework to propose a Backpropagation Neural Networks (i.e., BPNNs) based approaches for anomaly detection. However, previous researches ignore the communication overhead during model training using FL among large-scale edge devices. Expensive communication overhead may cause excessive overhead and long convergence time for edge devices so that the on-device DAD model cannot quickly detect anomalies. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a communication-efficient on-device FL framework to achieve accurate and timely anomaly detection for edge devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient on-device FL framework that leverages an attention mechanism-based CNN-LSTM (AMCNN-LSTM) model to achieve accurate and timely anomaly detection for edge devices.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep Anomaly Detection (DAD) has always been a hot issue in IIoT, which serves as a function of detecting anomalies. Previous researches about DAD generally can be divided into three categories: <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">supervised DAD</span>, <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semi-supervised DAD</span>, and <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unsupervised DAD</span> approaches.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Supervised Deep Anomaly Detection:</span>
Supervised deep anomaly detection typically uses the labels of normal and abnormal data to train a deep-supervised binary or multi-class classifier. For example, Erfani <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for high-dimensional data to classify normal and abnormal data. Despite the success of supervised DAD methods in anomaly detection, these methods are not as popular as semi-supervised or unsupervised methods due to the lack of labeled training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the supervised DAD method has poor performance for data with class imbalance (the total number of positive class data is much larger than the total number of negative class data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Semi-supervised Deep Anomaly Detection:</span>
Since normal instances are easier to obtain the labels than that of anomalies, semi-supervised DAD techniques are proposed to utilize a single (normally positive class) existing label to separate outliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. For example, Wulsin <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> applied Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) in a semi-supervised paradigm to model Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms for classification and anomaly detection. The semi-supervised DBN performance is comparable to the standard classifier on EEG dataset. The semi-supervised DAD approach is popular because it can use only a single class of labels to detect anomalies.

Both the edge devices and the cloud aggregator repeat the above process until the global model reaches convergence. This paradigm significantly reduces the risks of privacy leakage by decoupling the model training from direct access to the raw training data on edge nodes.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Large-scale FL training requires significant communication bandwidth for gradient exchange, which limits the scalability of multi-nodes training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In this context, Lin <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> stated that 99.9% of the gradient exchange in D-SGD is redundant. To avoid expensive communication bandwidth limiting large-scale distributed training, gradient compression is proposed to greatly reduce communication bandwidth. Researchers generally use gradient quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and gradient sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> to achieve gradient compression. Gradient quantization reduces communication bandwidth by quantizing gradients to low-precision values. Gradient sparsification uses threshold quantization to reduce communication bandwidth.</p>

The edge devices train a shared global model locally on their own local dataset (i.e., sensing time series data from IIoT nodes) and upload their model updates (i.e., gradients) to the cloud aggregator. The cloud aggregator uses the FedAVG algorithm or other aggregation algorithms to aggregate these model updates and obtains a new global model. In the end, the edge devices will receive the new global model sent by the cloud aggregator and use it to achieve accurate and timely anomaly detection.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">If the gradients reach 99.9% sparsity, only the 0.1% gradients with the largest absolute value are useful for model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we only need to aggregate the gradient with a larger absolute value to update the model. This way reduces the byte size of the gradient matrix, which can reduce the number of gradients exchanged between the device and the cloud to improve communication efficiency, especially for distributed machine learning systems. Inspired by the above facts, we propose a gradient compression mechanism to reduce the gradients exchanged between the cloud aggregator and the edge devices. We expect that this mechanism can further improve the communication efficiency of the proposed framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.9" class="ltx_p">When we choose a gradient with a larger absolute value, we will meet the following situations: (1) All gradient values in the gradient matrix are not greater than the given threshold; (2) There are some gradient values in the gradient matrix that are very close to the given threshold. If we set these gradients that do not meet the threshold requirements to 0, it will cause information loss. Therefore, the device uses a local gradient accumulation scheme to prevent information loss. Specifically, the cloud returns smaller gradients to the device instead of filtering the gradients. The device keeps the smaller gradient in the buffer and accumulates all the smaller gradients until it reaches a given threshold. Note that we use D-SGD for iterative updates, and the loss function to be optimized is defined as follows:</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.7" class="ltx_p">When the gradients’ sparsification reaches a high value (e.g., 99%), it will affect the model convergence. By following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, we use momentum correction and local gradient clipping to mitigate this effect. Momentum correction can make the accumulated small local gradients converge toward the gradients with a larger absolute value, thereby accelerating the model’s convergence speed. Local gradient clipping is used to alleviate the problem of gradient explosions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.

Therefore, we need to use these datasets to train a FL model that can detect anomalies.
We divide all datasets into a training set and a test set in a 7: 3 ratio. We implement the proposed framework by using Pytorch and PySyft <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.

The reason is that we use the on-device FL framework to train and update the model, which can learn the time-series features from different edge devices as much as possible, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the FL framework provides opportunities for edge devices to update models in a timely manner. This helps the edge device owner to update the model on the edge devices in time.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient on-device FL-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time series data in IIoT. First, we introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can solve the problem of data islands. Second, we propose an attention mechanism-based CNN-LSTM (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features and prevent memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on four real-world datasets and compare it with CNN-LSTM, LSTM, GRU, SAEs, and SVM methods. The experimental results show that the AMCNN-LSTM model can achieve the highest accuracy on all four datasets. Third, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-<span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> selection to improve communication efficiency. Experimental results validate that this mechanism can compress the gradient by 300 times without losing accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the pioneering work for deep anomaly detection by using on-device FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we will focus on researching privacy-enhanced FL frameworks and more robust anomaly detection models. The reason is that the FL framework is vulnerable to malicious attacks by malicious participants and a more robust model can be applied to a wider range of application scenarios.</p>
