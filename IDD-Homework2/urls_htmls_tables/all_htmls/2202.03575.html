<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The continuous expanded scale of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leads to IIoT equipments generating massive amounts of user data every moment. According to the different requirement of end users, these data usually have high heterogeneity and privacy, while most of users are reluctant to expose them to the public view. How to manage these time series data in an efficient and safe way in the field of IIoT is still an open issue, such that it has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous and private data. This paper studies the FL technology applications to manage IIoT equipment data in wireless network environments. In order to increase the model aggregation rate and reduce communication costs, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to IIoT equipment selection process, specifically to select those IIoT equipment nodes with accurate models. Therefore, we propose a FL algorithm assisted by DRL, which can take into account the privacy and efficiency of data training of IIoT equipment. By analyzing the data characteristics of IIoT equipments, we use MNIST, fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to represent the data generated by IIoT. During the experiment, we employ the deep neural network (DNN) model to train the data, and experimental results show that the accuracy can reach more than 97%, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

The global distribution of user equipments (UEs) is widespread and decentralized due to the influence of geographic location. Limited by the costs of transmission media (cables, optical fibers) and communication delays, traditional network infrastructures are not suitable for the development of Industry 4.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, wireless networks are widely used in Industry 4.0 because of its flexibility and portability. The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one key technology to realize Industry 4.0. Many applications of IIoT are based on wireless networks, such as intelligent robots, driverless cars, smart grid and smart medical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

A large number of IIoT equipments access to IIoT frequently, which can produce a huge amount of data in a short period of time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Radio network resource management faces severe challenges, including storage, spectrum, computing resource allocation, and joint allocation of multiple resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. With the rapid development of communication networks, the integrated space-ground network has also become a key research object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. How to efficiently manage, store and use these time series data has become an important research topic.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The data generated by IIoT equipments often involves users’ private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Service providers and users do not want this information to be exposed to the third party, but this kind of data is usually vulnerable to attacks from heterogeneous networks, heterogeneous equipments or malware <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, there needs an approach to support IIoT, that cannot only maintain the heterogeneity and privacy of data, but also reduce the communication cost and model training deviation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

FL prevents the leakage of users’ personal private information to a certain extent by separating the central server’s direct access to the original data from the model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In addition, FL can effectively maintain the heterogeneity of data and reduce the deviation of model training. Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> has proved that FL can be effectively applied to multiple learning tasks. Considering the privacy, heterogeneity and wide distribution of the device data in IIoT, FL in IIoT may have a positive effect.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid popularization of IIoT technology, the geographical distribution of IIoT equipments is becoming more and more extensive and the equipment forms are quite different from each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. This leads to a series of problems such as uneven data quality of equipment and high communication cost. In order to increase the model training rate of IIoT equipments and reduce the communication cost of model aggregation, driven by the current artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) assisted FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

Considering that a large amount of data generated by IIoT equipments will lead to excessive training data, increase the burden on wireless network channels and may cause privacy leaks, we employ a distributed method to train DRL agents, i.e., apply the DRL assisted FL method on each IIoT equipment to realize the effective application of FL in IIoT.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">IIoT has been widely concerned by the industry. Especially in the field of IIoT, there have been many solutions to solve the practical problems of IIoT by using AI technology. Due to the explosive growth of user equipments and data streams, IIoT has seen a shortage of spectrum resources. Shi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a spectrum resource management scheme for IIoT networks. Specifically, in order to consider the differentiated communication needs of different users, the authors proposed a modified deep Q-learning network (MDQN) and designed a new reward function to drive the learning process. Afterwards, the authors established a simple medium access control model, which used the base station as the sole agent to manage spectrum resources. In the end, the solution promoted the sharing of spectrum between different types of users. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> studied the joint power control and dynamic resource management of multi-access edge computing (MEC) in IIoT. The authors transformed this problem into Markov decision process (MDP) and used the dynamic resource management algorithm based on DRL to solve this process. The algorithm fully considered the dynamic and continuity of task generation, and finally used the DDPG to optimize the long-term average delay of dynamic resource management. The experimental results showed that the method was effective. Based on blockchain technology, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed an emerging data collection and sharing scheme to deal with the two main problems faced by IIoT. The first was to achieve efficient data collection within the limited energy and sensing range of mobile terminals. The second was to ensure the security of data sharing between mobile terminals. The authors combined blockchain and DRL algorithms, used DRL to maximize data collection, and then used blockchain technology to ensure data security. This scheme embodied the superior performance of the two technologies.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The latest development of FL in IIoT was an efficient deep anomaly detection framework based on equipment joint learning proposed by Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which was used to detect time series data in IIoT. The authors first used a FL framework to enable edge equipments to co-train an anomaly model. After that, they used the attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network (CNN) long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture important fine-grained features. In the end, the authors used a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-k selection to improve communication efficiency. A large number of experiments on real data sets showed that the algorithm can effectively reduce communication overhead. FL was originally proposed by Brendan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. They first proposed a decentralized method for private data training–FL, and then conducted extensive experimental evaluations using five different model structures and four data sets to verify the robustness of the FL method. This research opened a precedent for the exploration of FL technology. In addition, there were some typical representatives who applied FL to solve different actual network problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which had shown good results in solving the computing, caching and communication, and IIoT problems of the intelligent mobile edge.</p>

Similar to the above works, we have jointly paid attention to the data privacy issues in the IIoT scene, and proposed feasible solutions from the perspective of design framework and algorithm implementation. However, the biggest difference between our work and the above works is that we use DRL algorithm to select high-quality IIoT equipment nodes for FL, so as to improve the rate of model aggregation and reduce the communication cost.

DRL agent training real data from IIoT equipments has more advantages than agent data provided by the data center. The data generated by IIoT equipments is usually highly secretive and large in scale. DRL agents also need to record them on a central server when they are trained based on local models. In order to better verify the effectiveness of FL assisted by DRL, we extract the data characteristics generated by IIoT equipments as follows: (1) high privacy, (2) unbalanced amount of data (a lot of user output is used, the user output is low), (3) the distribution scale is large, and (4) the user equipment is limited by the communication quality. Corresponding to the actual situation of the data generated by IIoT equipments, our experiments are carried out on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 (independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)). The reason for using the above data sets is that they can reflect the characteristics of data heterogeneity, scale difference and dispersion to a certain extent.</p>

<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of non-IID, the data between users can be divided equally or unequal. We assume that there is a fixed number of IIoT devices in each round of communication between the server and devices. When the communication process starts, the devices are randomly divided into several groups, and the server will send the current global model parameters to each device. In order to improve the communication quality, we use DRL algorithm based on DDPG to select some device nodes to participate in the training. After that, each selected device will calculate according to the global state and local data set, and then send the update to the server. The server uses this repeated method to update the global model parameters. In this way, the non-IID characteristics of IIoT device data can be considered. The experimental setup part will be introduced in detail later.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of integrating DRL into FL is to intelligently use the cooperation between IIoT equipments and nodes to exchange learning parameters, so as to better train the local model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Due to the limited cache and performance calculation of the edge IIoT equipments and nodes, and the direct transmission of a large amount of data may cause network channel congestion or even data leakage, and so the data is trained in the local equipment. Therefore, we make full use of the efficient model training performance of DRL and conduct data confidentiality training based on FL. The final purpose is to verify the training effectiveness of equipment data in IIoT. We deploy DRL agents in every edge IIoT equipment. Considering the inherent characteristics of wireless network, if the amount of data to be trained is large, it will increase the burden on the wireless network channel. Moreover, the data needs to be transformed for privacy reasons, so the correlation of the central server-side agent data may not be as good as the data on the edge equipments. In addition, deploying DRL agents on edge equipments alone may cause additional energy consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the above problems, we propose a FL framework assisted by DRL, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Framework ‣ IV Implementation of Federated Learning Algorithm Assisted by DRL ‣ Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Federated Learning Algorithm for Data Management of IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Considering a large number of data factors, we adopt the distributed deep learning (DL) method. As shown in TABLE <a href="#S2.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ II-B Related Work of Industrial Internet of Things Based on Federal Learning ‣ II Related Work ‣ Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Federated Learning Algorithm for Data Management of IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, distributed DL has good performance of fast training and edge efficiency. Therefore, the fast training of the data on edge equipments can avoid network congestion to certain extents. Considering that the correlation of agent data on the central server is not as good as that of the edge equipment, in the IIoT scenario, a large number of IIoT equipments are equipped with perceptron, which can obtain rich and personalized data to update the global model. Based on these data, the central server-side agent data can be effectively updated to match the data of the edge equipment side. The FL framework based on DRL mainly completes three tasks: node selection, local training and global aggregation. Node selection is achieved by using the DRL algorithm based on DDPG, in order to select IIoT nodes with high data quality to participate in the model training process. The purpose of local training is to derive local model parameters suitable for local nodes. The purpose of global aggregation is to generate a global model suitable for data training, which is achieved by uploading local model parameters to each local server.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The operation of selecting specific IIoT devices is called a scheduling strategy. Since the reading and execution of data in the central server and the reading and execution of data in various IIoT devices are not in the same order of magnitude, uploading the training and updated models of all IIoT devices to the global controller will cause a lot of computing time and communication overhead. Therefore, it is an effective way to select a specific part of equipment upload parameter model through the scheduling strategy. Scheduling strategies play a crucial role in allocating wireless channels with limited resources to appropriate IIoT devices.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the different uses and geographical distribution of IIoT equipments, the data they generate will have the characteristics of heterogeneity, and the quality of the data will also vary. The problems of low data training efficiency, long model aggregation time and high wireless communication cost caused by data characteristics are major challenges in the application of FL in the field of IIoT. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of model aggregation and reduce communication costs, inspired by reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, we use DRL algorithm to select IIoT equipment nodes with accurate learning models. The main idea is to model the local training cost of IIoT equipments and describe the problem as a MDP. We use DDPG to find the optimal solution of MDP. DRL agent continuously interacts with the environment to accumulate maximum reward and the essential purpose is to minimize the cost of FL.</p>

Considering the outstanding characteristics of heterogeneity and privacy of data generated by IIoT equipments, we use MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to represent them. Based on MLP and CNN to train the above data sets, the training accuracy is rising in the process of continuous communication between the client and the central server. Among them, CIFAR-10 data set can achieve 85% test accuracy, while MNIST and Fashion MNIST data sets can achieve more than 98% training accuracy. Therefore, it can be shown that the FL algorithm assisted by DRL has excellent performance and has the ability to effectively manage and train the equipment data of IIoT.</p>

So overall, the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective in improving the data training rate. Each selected IIoT device calculates the average gradient of local data based on the current model, and then the central server aggregates these gradients and updates them using equation (4). Each IIoT device uses its local data to perform one-step gradient descent based on the current model, and then the server performs a weighted average of the generated model. The final algorithm achieved good results.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">IIoT is the key technology to realize industry 4.0 and it is also the objective embodiment of the development degree of industry 4.0. What cannot be ignored is that the current IIoT is facing the management and training problems brought by the explosive growth of user data. The emergence of FL provides a new solution paradigm for heterogeneous data and private data training, and it can support the development of IIoT in a way that reduces model deviation. This paper mainly aims at the problem of how to manage and train a large amount of data produced by IIoT, and proposes a FL algorithm assisted by DRL in wireless network environments. DRL based on DDPG is mainly used for the selection of IIoT equipment nodes. We fully analyze the heterogeneity and privacy of the data generated by IIoT equipments. In the experimental phase, we use MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to represent IIoT equipment data. The final results show that the FL algorithm assisted by DRL can effectively train the above data sets and achieve a high accuracy rate, which shows the effectiveness of the FL algorithm assisted by DRL in the management of IIoT equipment data.</p>
