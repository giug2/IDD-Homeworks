<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a new form of collaborative machine learning, where a common model can be learned while keeping all the training data on local devices. Although it is designed for enhancing the data privacy, we demonstrated in this paper a new direction in inference attacks in the context of FL, where valuable information about training data can be obtained by adversaries with very limited power. In particular, we proposed three new types of attacks to exploit this vulnerability. The first type of attack, <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Class Sniffing</em>, can detect whether a certain label appears in training. The other two types of attacks can determine the quantity of each label, i.e., <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Quantity Inference</em> attack determines the composition proportion of the training label owned by the selected clients in a single round, while <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Whole Determination</em> attack determines that of the whole training process. We evaluated our attacks on a variety of tasks and datasets with different settings, and the corresponding results showed that our attacks work well generally. Finally, we analyzed the impact of major hyper-parameters to our attacks and discussed possible defenses.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of federated learning (FL) enables multiple devices to learn a common model while keeping all the training data on their own devices. It allows for less resource consumption on the cloud and ensures the privacy at the same time. Multiple applications have benefited from FL, including mobile phones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, wearable devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, etc.
In standard federated learning, all participants are required to train their local models. A random subset of clients will be selected each round, who will upload their gradient updates to the central server. Similar FL architectures can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One interesting question here is about the security and privacy implication in the FL training process. Any characteristic of clients’ private data needs to be protected carefully since it may reveal some important private information about the training data – e.g., the distribution of labels might show the diversity of participants.
Similarly, what the training data consists of is also what attackers want to explore, i.e., can they determine the quantity proportion of different labels in the whole training dataset during the training process?
This problem may pose serious threats to FL security. For instance, an attacker can acquire information about the morbidity of a particular disease if the government is training an online disease diagnosis system.
A malicious store can figure out the relation between the supply and demand of a certain product when there is a new commodity registration system trained with FL approach, and it can then adjust its price accordingly to gain unfair advantage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, there are mainly two areas of research on attacking FL models:
division and aggregation, which correspond to the two main roles in FL (distributed devices and central server). The former one assumes that the attacker compromises some participated devices and uses them to achieve malicious intentions, e.g. importing backdoor to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, adversarial poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, membership or property inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The attacks in the latter area are relatively less-studied. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors assume that the central server is malicious and train a GAN to reproduce data samples similar to the privacy of clients. Similar idea can also be seen in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Please see Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Related Work ‣ Eavesdrop the Composition Proportion of Training Labels in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a> for a more comprehensive discussion on related works.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These previously-studied attacks to FL, e.g., membership inference or reconstruction attack, did not lay much emphasis on the quantity information in training, as they usually focus on existential information, i.e., whether a certain sample exists in training data. Another drawback of these approaches is that they all need individual updates that clients sent to the server. However, under the secure aggregation protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or differential privacy techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, both the participants and the server cannot acquire the individual updates in the plain form, which make most of these attacks difficult. Therefore, more practical and applicable attacks should be based on the assumption that the observation of individual updates is not available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned issues motivated us to consider attacks without asking individual updates. In this paper, we propose three new inference attacks with high success rate and without the need of any gradient updates from individual clients. In addition, our attacks concentrate on the quantity information of training data in FL, which could lead to serious consequences but has never been studied in prior works to the best of our knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and generality of our approaches, and the results showed the existence of vulnerability from quantity privacy leakage.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of deep learning techniques has received significant interests in recent years. It also has a wide range of applications on different types of devices, which gives a bright stage for FL to show its merits on convenience, privacy protection and resource utilization. In fact, FL has shown great promises not only on smartphone-based applications (e.g., human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, heart rate monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and keyboard prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>), but also in other fields, such as healthcare industry (e.g., disease diagnosis online expert system and medical insurance registration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>) and transportation systems (vehicular networking technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL is designed to preserve the private data of individuals, and any information or characteristic should be protected seriously. In FL architecture, training data owned by clients comes from various sources, so the quantity of samples among different labels might be unbalanced, which reflects the clients’ overall characteristic. It is a potential source of information leakage if these quantities are illegally obtained by malicious attackers.
For instance, an organization wants to build up an online disease prediction system with FL structure among thousands of hospitals. Each hospital trains their local model with their own data, and the organization will obtain a global model that is able to predict the trend of many diseases, not just a small group of diseases emerged in a single hospital. Then, there is a malicious player who wants to know how many hospitals have treated a particular disease, so that it can raise the corresponding treatment expenses and even estimate the approximate distribution scope of this disease. This is a simple example of attackers may try to learn the composition proportion of training data for their advantage, and many other applications could have similar concern.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, in this work, the goal of attackers is defined as to <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">infer the quantity information of particular training labels, especially the composition proportion of training labels in a single training round and the whole training process.</span></p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike prior inference attack, the application setting here is based on more realistic scenarios, i.e., the central aggregation server will choose a set of clients randomly from thousands of participants, which we call the <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">selection process</span>, and collect their gradient updates generated by training local models with each own data in every training epoch. After such collection, we assume a secure aggregation algorithm, which is an important characteristic of FL, is executed so that the server cannot observe individual updates sent by clients in plain text form but can only acquire the aggregated value.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">According to the property inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, we know that particular batches, or particular property of training data, can result in change of gradient on corresponding neurons but have little effect on other neurons. As we know, different training labels are units of different features. Given that we sum up all property inferences towards the feature set for a particular label, is it possible to infer some information about such label rather than just its properties? As we discovered, the answer is yes: an adversary can infer some important information about the training label by analyzing gradient changes in the training process. Here, without loss of generality, we assume that the same labels possessed by different clients result in similar local gradient changes. And if we can determine the global updates consist of how many such local changes, then the number of clients who own the same labels can be obtained.</p>

He will need some prior knowledge about the training process, i.e., the average number of labels owned by each participant and the probable number of data samples per label. Such information can be estimated by collecting the data of a few participants and performing simple statistical analysis.

But their magnitudes are different, i.e., the extent of increase is much higher than that of decrease. The specific values of weight update magnitudes may be changing in different training rounds. Nevertheless, the information about magnitudes in different training rounds can be obtained by training local models on the current global model, just like what the attacker does in Class Sniffing.</p>

This set of weights are easily to experience the aforementioned ‘Offset’ phenomenon, which could make the attack fail. Hence, the first question from the attacker perspective is how to remove them from the original intact inputting neuron weights. First, when we train the network with the data of a certain label in the training process, its existence will make the corresponding inputting neuron weights grow while the inputting neuron weights of other labels decrease.

In various experiments, such phenomenon can be easily observed. For instance, it appears after 10 epochs in the MNIST classifier training process, which is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-E Whole Determination ‣ III Design ‣ Eavesdrop the Composition Proportion of Training Labels in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ III-E Whole Determination ‣ III Design ‣ Eavesdrop the Composition Proportion of Training Labels in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The attacker is then able to analyze this phenomenon to access the information about the composition proportion of training labels.</p>

Finally, these vectors can be clustered into different groups by an unsupervised algorithm, and the vectors being in the same group indicates their corresponding labels have approximately the same number of data samples in training. The quantity could present huge differences if labels belong to different clusters.
Here, the unsupervised algorithm we adopted is Hierarchical Clustering, which can classify given data into different clusters with the metric of Euclidean Distance. Attackers may also choose other clustering approaches.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to simulate more practical application scenarios of FL, we try to allocate training dataset samples randomly. Let us take MNIST as an example. We create a setting with 100 participants. In each training round, the server is required to select 10 clients randomly and collect their gradient updates to form an aggregated global model. In our setting, each participant can possess 3, 4 or 5 main labels and a small number of other labels, and the number of data samples per main label is much larger than that of other labels. All participants select their own main labels randomly. The data allocations of other datasets are similar to that of MNIST, which we believe can simulate the practical scenarios to some extent.</p>

To our knowledge, the standard application of FL usually allows participants to train their local model only one epoch. The reason is that considering the limited computation capacity of local devices, more epochs will drastically increase the computation load and may affect the normal operation of those devices.
Recently, some researchers propose that local devices can shoulder more computation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which means more local training epochs are possible, however more than 10 epochs would still be quite demanding. Thus, we believe that Quantity Inference should work well in most circumstances, even when there are multiple local training epochs (as long as not too many).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whole Determination is an attack typically towards developed models, which have been trained with considerable data samples and perform well on corresponding given tasks. Hence, for its evaluation, we choose to launch the attack in the middle and late stages of the training process when the model is near to convergence. However, it does not mean that Whole Determination cannot work in more advanced stages. Before the attack, all datasets above are required to train themselves under their own default settings. When the loss of model decreases to a relative small value, the attacker will use Whole Determination to obtain the composition proportion of training labels.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In previous experiments, the number of data samples with each label is decided via random selection, but here we cannot apply this selection strategy. We need to make the numbers of data samples belonging to each label have differences, otherwise we cannot evaluate the performance of Whole Determination. To start with, we should figure out the connection between the magnitude of ratio difference and the proportion difference of labels. We conduct experiments by changing the number of samples belonging to a certain label and record the corresponding ratio difference. The results are presented in Figure <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ IV-D1 Dataset Allocation ‣ IV-D Whole Determination ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Eavesdrop the Composition Proportion of Training Labels in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. As shown in the figure, obvious ratio difference can be observed when there is a four-fold difference in the number of samples owned by the two labels. As a result, we divide the whole labels into 3 groups randomly, and ensure that each label in the first group can be allocated with <math id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑄</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">Q</annotation></semantics></math> data samples, the second group can only acquire <math id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q/4" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">4</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><divide id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></divide><ci id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑄</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">4</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1c">Q/4</annotation></semantics></math>, and the last group just get <math id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q/5" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><divide id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1"></divide><ci id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑄</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1c">Q/5</annotation></semantics></math> samples.

Clearly, the dataset allocation is different in each training process because of the random allocation. We also use success rate as our metric, and only consider the attack successful when the clustering results are exactly the same as the data allocation before training, including the number of clusters and the specific labels in each cluster; otherwise we regard it as a failure.</p>

We can see that the average success rate is very high (almost 95%), which shows that Whole Determination attack can be effective under such circumstances. The success rate of middle stage is a little worse than that of late stage. We think the reason could be that the exploration direction of gradient is relatively more random in the middle stage of training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It could be asked why we consider the output layer and whether similar phenomenon exists in other layers, e.g., hidden layers.
The main task of the front network layers is typically to extract and filter the features of training data, which means the objects to be processed are various features. The emergence of a particular feature leads to corresponding gradient updates, while its absence has no influence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. It is interesting to note that a certain label usually possesses many different features, in other words, it is an unity of multiple features. And different labels possibly have the same features, e.g., cats and dogs have similar fur features. What is more, in some special neural networks, the features embedded in front layers are not explainable or interpretable to human analysts practically, especially the cases in convolution operation. These characteristics make the front layers not applicable to our case, where we want to obtain the quantity information about training labels. However, in case we cannot access the output layer but only several front layers, we could try to apply some Explainable Machine Learning techniques to extract the key features of each class, like LIME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> for linear classifiers and LEMNA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> for deep neural networks. Explainable Machine Learning aims at figuring out why a particular input sample is clustered into its corresponding label and obtaining some relatively interpretable reasons for users, especially for debuggers and computer security practitioners. And these reasons, namely the key features, can be served as the identifications for different labels, and our method is possibly able to build on them.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, there is no need to share the whole network parameters in collaborative learning. In other words, compressing or distilling the significant neuron updates can also make the global model converge and achieve great performance. As for our attacks, the adversary does not need to observe any individual updates, and what he needs is only the global model parameters, hence there is some possible impact to the attacks if the participants cannot acquire the whole global model (it can only acquire part of it).</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We try to simulate such defense in our experiment setting, and we choose to keep the weights whose gradient updates are relatively greater and make other weights invisible to participants. Specifically, if we set the compression rate (CR) in advance, each client will select top CR of inputting weight updates to be uploaded to the server. This simple compression operation might make the convergence of global model slower to some extent, but the influence to performance of the model is not great. And under such circumstances, we conduct some experiments on Quantity Inference under the default setting (MNIST on CNN).

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed three original inference attacks against federated learning. The attack target includes the quantity composition proportion of training labels, a new consideration in FL security. Specifically, <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Class Sniffing</span> can detect the existence of a particular label in a single training round; <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Quantity Inference</span> is able to determine how many clients own a certain label from the perspective of a single iteration; and finally, <span id="S7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Whole Determination</span> aims to infer the quantity information among different labels for the whole training process. All of them work in a passive way, and they will not impose any influence to the whole FL structure, hence it is difficult for the prevalent intrusion detection techniques to detect our attacks. Besides, all three attacks do not require the observation of any individual gradient updates from participants, which enables the attackers to apply them in more practical scenarios.</p>
