<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. However, FL entails exposing the model to various participants. This poses a risk of unauthorized model distribution or resale by the malicious client, compromising the intellectual property rights of the FL group. To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embedding the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints. Experimental results show FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, and maintains good fidelity and robustness against various watermark removal attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has turned into one of the most popular frameworks for distributedly training deep learning models without sharing private messages. FL is nowadays widely applied in various privacy-sensitive domains, such as object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, medical image analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and so on. FL meets the privacy needs of the data owners while producing high-quality models for the community. However, collaborative training in FL makes the model publicly available to multiple participants, which may lead to the model leakage issue in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Model leakage in FL refers to the malicious distribution or sale of FL models by clients for personal gain. This behavior infringes the legitimate copyright of the FL group. Detecting copyright infringement and protecting intellectual property rights has become a critical issue in FL. There are two major concerns in FL copyright protection, ownership verification and traceability. Ownership verification involves verifying the ownership of the FL model when it is illegally distributed and charging the unauthorized user outside the FL group with tort. The FL model should be considered as the intellectual property of the FL group instead of any individual. Any legal use of the FL model should be made with the consent of the FL group. Traceability refers to disclose the identity of the culprit among the FL participants who illegally distribute the model to third-parties outside the FL group. It is a new requirement for protecting the copyright of the FL model, which to our best knowledge has not been addressed before.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To protect the copyright of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), DNN watermarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, including <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">parameter-based</em> watermark and <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor-based</em> watermark, are proposed. <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Parameter-based</em> watermark methods embed personal watermarks into the parameters or the distribution of the parameters of the DNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. It can provide multi-bit information, but the extraction of watermarks needs white-box access to the suspicious model, which limits the application. On the contrary, <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor-based</em> watermark methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> take advantage of backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to insert specific triggers to identify the ownership of the model. Although <em id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor-based</em> watermark can be verified through black-box access, it is usually zero-bit. This means the watermark can only demonstrate the presence or absence of the watermark instead of a bit string representing identity.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent works also explores applying DNN watermarks to FL copyright protection. WAFFLE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is the first watermarking scheme designed for FL, in which the Server is responsible for embedding the <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor-based</em> watermarks into the FL model. WAFFLE propose to conduct a retraining step after federated aggregation to embed the watermark. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> propose to entitle the Clients to embed both <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">parameter-based</em> and <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor-based</em> watermarks into the global model. However, existing works only focus on ownership verification. None of them can provide traceability of the model leakers for FL models. Even if the FL group can prove the ownership of the FL model in the event of the infringement, they are not capable of detecting the model leakers hidden among them.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We aim to design a complete FL copyright protection framework that can furnish both ownership verification and traceability for the FL model. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that offers both. The illustration of the problem and our framework is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Specifically, we design a bi-level protection scheme that enables ownership verification and traceability respectively. On one level, FedTracker embeds a global watermark into the aggregated global model in each iteration. While the copyright infringement occurs, the FL group can extract the watermark and verify the ownership. On the other level, before distributing the model in each iteration, the server insert a unique local fingerprint for each client to identify each model. The model leaker can be traced by disclose the identification inside the model.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, the challenges of applying such framework are two-fold:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is challenging to preserve the utility of the model in condition of a lack of natural data. Since the server is assumed to have no access to the training data, the server should embed the watermark which is out of distribution of natural data. This can compromise the model’s utility.</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is challenging to guarantee the discrimination of different models. Since we need to embed and compare multiple different fingerprints, it puts a higher requirement on the identifiability and robustness of fingerprints and the model leaker.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenges mentioned above, first we propose a watermark embedding algorithm based on Continual Learning (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to improve the utility of the watermarked model. We regard the primitive task of FL and the watermark embedding task as learning data from different domains and the utility drop is attributed to the catastrophic forgetting while learning a different task. We get the inspiration from the Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and design a CL-based embedding algorithm for the FL scenario. We introduce our CL-based watermark embedding algorithm in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Embedding Watermark without Natural Data ‣ 4 Ownership Verification and Traceability in Federated Learning ‣ FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Second, to enhance the differentiation between different models of different Clients, we conduct the fingerprint generation by minimizing the maximal distance between fingerprints. We also propose a Fingerprint Similarity Score (FSS) to measure the similarity of the extracted fingerprint and clients’ fingerprints. Compared with traditional hamming distance whose output is discrete, FSS can provide more fine-grained measurement because the output of FSS is continuous. And thus, using FSS can better discriminate different fingerprints. Moreover, we embed the watermark and fingerprints respectively into different parts of the model to lower the mutual impact and improve the effectiveness of both mechanisms. The details are present in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Distinguish Different Models of Different Clients ‣ 4 Ownership Verification and Traceability in Federated Learning ‣ FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>.</p>

Model compression methods aim to eliminate the redundancy in the model parameters, and thus, the embedded watermark may also be erased during this process. In this paper, we consider two different categories of model compression methods, <em id="S3.SS2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model pruning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and <em id="S3.SS2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">quantization</em>. Model pruning eliminates the parameters that have little or no impact on the network performance. Model quantization reduces the numerical precision of the parameters, such as using 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats, to save memory bandwidth and computational cost. Both techniques could have a negative impact on the watermark with minimum accuracy loss.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedTracker, the first FL copyright protection framework that can provide both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker conducts the protecting mechanism from Server-side due to the security issues of Client-side watermarking discussed in Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 FL Watermarking Methods ‣ 2 Background ‣ FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>. In FedTracker, a bi-level protecting mechanism is included. For the first level, a global watermark is embedded into the global model so that the models in FL can contain the global watermark for ownership verification. We utilize backdoor-based watermark as the global watermark since backdoor-based watermark can be verified through API access. For the second level, a unique local fingerprint is inserted into the model of each client for further traceability. Since traceability requires distinguishing different Clients’ model, the multi-bit parameter-based watermark is feasible as the local fingerprints.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This can be attributed to the following two reasons. Firstly, in the initialization phase, the server needs to conduct a data-free trigger set construction algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to generate the watermark trigger set. The data-free trigger set is out of distribution (OOD) of the training data. Retraining the model on the OOD trigger set leads to catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> of the previous task and has a large impact on the functionality of the model. Secondly, the principle of BN layers amplifying the negative effect. BN works by applying a linear transformation to the outputs of the previous layer, such that they have zero mean and unit variance. However, the mean and variance of the trigger set are far different from natural data. Thus, the utility of the model is significantly compromised during watermark embedding.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above observations, we consider the primitive task and the watermark embedding task as two different tasks from different domains, which is the intuition of Continual Learning (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. CL aims to reduce the catastrophic forgetting of the previous task when learning a new task. Applying CL can help to reduce the negative impact on the primitive task and maintain the utility of the model on both two tasks.</p>

We get the inspiration from Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. GEM stores a subset of data from previous tasks in an episodic memory and using it to constrain the gradient updates during training. However, the server has no training data to store. Thus, we propose to alter the primitive GEM to fit the Federated Learning scenario.</p>

We need to maximize the minimal hamming distance among the fingerprints.

Existing works mainly utilize Hamming distance to measure the difference between two fingerprints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

First, as analyzed in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Embedding Watermark without Natural Data ‣ 4 Ownership Verification and Traceability in Federated Learning ‣ FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>, the trigger set generated by the data-free trigger set construction method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is out of the distribution of natural data. Directly learning the trigger set can significantly affect the stability of BN layers and decrease the utility. Thus freezing the BN layers can help retain the utility of the model. Second, Freezing the BN layers can also avoid negative influence on local fingerprints, since the local fingerprints are embedded in the BN layers.</p>

They both consist of two main steps: trigger reverse engineering and trigger unlearning. Trigger reverse engineering tries to reconstruct the possible triggers that activate the backdoor in a given model. Trigger unlearning then involves retraining the model on the reversed trigger data with correct labels. In this way, the model can forget the association between the trigger and the target class, and restore its normal behavior.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Results from neural cleanse and FeatureRE indicate the robustness of the watermark against backdoor mitigation methods. The ineffectiveness of the two methods may be ascribed to the principles of backdoor reverse engineering. Existing backdoor mitigation methods use samples from natural datasets to reverse and construct a trigger set, which has a relatively small influence on the trigger set based on noise. A Backdoor based on natural data is more likely to be triggered in the real-world and thus more harmful than a backdoor based on noise. It is reasonable for the backdoor mitigation method to mainly focus on removing the former kind of backdoor.</p>

<p id="S6.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FedTracker, we propose to use Fingerprint Similarity Score (FSS) to measure the similarity between different fingerprints. However, existing watermarking scheme uses Hamming distance (HD) as metric. In this section, we present the detailed comparison of FSS and HD.</p>

<p id="S6.SS8.p2.3" class="ltx_p">When verifying the ownership of the deep learning model which is trained by only one party, the model owner only needs to compare the watermark extracted from the suspicious model with one single watermark. In that case, HD is enough to measure the similarity. However, in FedTracker, we need to compare the local fingerprint with each client’s fingerprint. HD rounds the value to a integer and thus loses some information. For example, the distance <math id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.7" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0.7</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1.1">0.7</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS8.p2.1.m1.1c">0.7</annotation></semantics></math> and the distance <math id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1.3" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1.3</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1.1">1.3</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS8.p2.2.m2.1c">1.3</annotation></semantics></math> are both rounded to <math id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS8.p2.3.m3.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math>, making the two fingerprints indistinguishable.</p>

But in the cases that the VGG-16 trained with 20 Clients and ResNet-18 trained with 30 Clients, using HD fail to disclose the identity of the model leaker, while using FSS is always effective.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework to simultaneously furnish ownership verification and traceability. Global watermark and local fingerprints mechanisms are utilized to verify the ownership of the FL model and trace the model back to the leaker respectively. We accordingly design a CL-based watermark embedding mechanism to improve fidelity and a novel metric named Fingerprint Similarity Score to measure the similarity of fingerprints. Evaluations of various tasks and settings show that FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, fidelity, and robustness.</p>
