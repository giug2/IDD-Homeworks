<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing emphasis on user privacy protection, biometric recognition based on federated learning have become the latest research hotspot. However, traditional federated learning methods cannot be directly applied to finger vein recognition, due to heterogeneity of data and open-set verification. Therefore, only a few application cases have been proposed. And these methods still have two drawbacks. (1) Uniform model results in poor performance in some clients, as the finger vein data is highly heterogeneous and non-Independently Identically Distributed (non-IID). (2) On individual client, a large amount of time is underutilized, such as the time to wait for returning model from server. To address those problems, this paper proposes a Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition (PAFedFV) framework. PAFedFV designs personalized model aggregation method to solve the heterogeneity among non-IID data. Meanwhile, it employs an asynchronized training module for clients to utilize their waiting time. Finally, extensive experiments on six finger vein datasets are conducted. Base on these experiment results, the impact of non-IID finger vein data on performance of federated learning are analyzed, and the superiority of PAFedFV in accuracy and robustness are demonstrated.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finger vein recognition, as an emerging biometric recognition, has received wide attention from researchers worldwide <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> </a>; Jin <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Hou <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Thanks to the development of deep learning in recent years, the performance of finger vein recognition based on convolutional neural networks has been improving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Recent research reveals that the training of finger vein recognition models depends strongly on a large number of centralized finger vein data. However, in real life, obtaining a large-scale finger vein dataset is very difficult and costly. The user’s finger vein data is often distributed in each local client. It is difficult for these clients to individually train an effective finger vein recognition model due to lack of data. Moreover, with the increasing emphasis on privacy protection, clients also find it is challenging to expand their datasets by sharing finger vein data. Therefore, how to utilize the data dispersed in clients to train an effective finger vein recognition model has become a research focus in biometrics.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Meng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, as a distributed learning framework with privacy-preserving premise, provides a potential solution to the above problem. FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is the classical FL method which has gained wide application in Internet of Things (IoT), medicine, autonomous driving, etc. However, existing FL methods cannot be directly applied to finger vein recognition for the following reasons: 1) finger vein recognition is mostly open-set classification tasks in real life. Unlike traditional FL tasks, its data distribution is not the same between the training and the test sets 2) Unlike most other fields where FL is applied, finger vein data among each client is more heterogeneous. Different acquisition devices lead to large discrepancy in image quality, finger location, and light intensity of finger vein images. And these differences make FL for finger vein recognition more difficult. Due to above limitations, FedFV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lian <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> is insofar the only FL method for finger vein recognition. It proposed a FL framework, FedFV, for finger vein recognition to address these restrictions. To an extent, FedFV solved the heterogeneity of non-IID finger vein data and performed open-set testing with good results. Nonetheless, it still has some shortcomings. For example, due to its simpler approach to personalizing settings in the local model, it may result in poor model performance for some clients. Similar to the traditional FL setup, it generates a significant amount of waiting time when clients communicate with servers, waiting for servers to process model aggregation, or waiting for other clients to conduct local training.</p>

In recent years, deep learn-based finger vein recognition has gradually become crucial thanks to their superior performance. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Meng and Yuan (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed SuperPoint-based finger vein recognition (SP-FVR), which utilized the fully convolutional neural network.

These methods have achieved relatively good results, but the majority of them rely on a large amount of finger vein data for model training. However, acquiring a large amount of finger vein data directly is challenging due to privacy protection concerns. This leads to difficulties in the widespread application of finger vein recognition technology. Therefore, it is of practical significance to train an effective model by utilizing scattered finger vein data while protecting user privacy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section specifies the personalized model aggregation method which instead of the traditional model averaging-based aggregation, which is shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.1 PAFedFV ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In traditional FL, model averaging-based aggregation methods exhibit poor performance in finger vein recognition. This occurs because a unified model fails to adjust to distribution variations across diverse finger vein datasets. To address this issue, we have devised a personalized model aggregation method, which is computed as follows. Firstly, the degree of two-by-two correlation between clients’ models is calculated. As shown in Equation <a href="#S3.E1" title="In 3.2 Personalized Model Aggregation ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the correlation degree between the <em id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">n</em>-th client’s and the <em id="S3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">u</em>-th client’s models is calculated.</p>

As depicted in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Personalized Model Aggregation ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, in traditional federated learning, clients await the aggregated model from the server before proceeding with their next round of local training. Consequently, this process is synchronous in traditional federated learning, resulting in considerable untapped waiting time for clients. In the PAFedFV framework, instead of idling during the waiting period, clients are allowed to continue training the local channel. Moreover, once the server returns the aggregated model (federated channel), the local and federated channels can be mutually adjusted through <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic"><math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{fv\_cos}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">f</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">v</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">_</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1b" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.5" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.5.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1c" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.6" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.6.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1d" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.7" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.7.cmml">s</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑓</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑣</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.4">_</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.5">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.6.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.6">𝑜</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.7.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.7">𝑠</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1.m1.1c">L_{fv\_cos}</annotation></semantics></math></em>.

The setup simulates a real-life FL scenario across multiple institutions. Additionally, finger vein recognition in this work is framed as an open-set task, implying that test set have different users from training set. The division between training and test sets follows an 8:2 split ratio. For instance, the FV-USM dataset encompasses 492 classes, of which the first 394 classes constitute the training set, while the remaining classes serve as the test set.

The datanum denotes the number of participating clients. For example, in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, it is considered as SOLO training on FV-USM when datanum = 1. When datanum=2, the box shows five results generated by pairing FV-USM with other data sets. When datanum=3, 4, and 5, the results of 10, 10, and 5 combinations are shown, respectively.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By analyzing Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the following conclusions can be drawn. 1) Heterogeneity among different clients’ data significantly impacts the performance of federated learning. Thus, having more participants does not necessarily lead to better performances for the federated client. Optimal results can be achieved by selecting the right combinations of participants. For instance, when all clients participated (datanum=6), the best performance was not observed across all datasets except UTFVP. 2) Different combinations of participants, even when having the same datanum, can result in substantial variations in outcomes. Particularly, two different participant combinations, both with datanum = 3, respectively yielded the best and worst performances on the FV-USM dataset. 3) The performance of each client does not experience an indefinite improvement with increasing participants. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, performance ceases to improve further after reaching the optimal outcome, even with continued increases in participants. Moreover, the performance even exhibits a decline when datanum = 6. To provide a more comprehensive analysis and demonstration, detailed results for datanum = 2 are recorded in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.2.1 Heterogeneity influence ‣ 5.2 Result and Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the efficacy of PAFedFV, it was compared with SOLO and Centralized training. The outcomes are presented in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2.1 Heterogeneity influence ‣ 5.2 Result and Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, showcasing PAFedFV’s superior performance. Among them, its efficacy is most pronounced on VERA, where it reduces the EER by 4.55 and enhances TAR(@FAR=0.01) by 18.18. These improvements suggest that PAFedFV provides more substantial enhancements for clients with smaller datasets. Moreover, PAFedFV even surpasses Centralized training on USM, HKPU, NUPT, and UTFVP datasets. Specifically, on USM, PAFedFV yields the most exceptional results with reducing EER by 1.37 and enhancing TAR(@FAR=0.01) by 3.92 compared to Centralized training. This observation, corroborated by the findings in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ PAFedFV: Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, underscores the detrimental impact of distributed differences among non-IID finger vein datasets on Centralized training.

Particularly, on UTFVP, the most significant advancement is seen, reducing EER by 5.1 and elevating TAR(@FAR=0.01) by 15.51. The Personal Aggregation module, designed to replace the traditional model averaging approach, leads to a notable performance boost for nearly all clients, with an average EER reduction of 0.62 and an average TAR(@FAR=0.01) improvement of 1.66. The experiment results show that these modules effectively improve the performance of the finger vein recognition model and solve the heterogeneity among finger vein datasets.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a Personalized and Asynchronous Federated Learning for Finger Vein Recognition framework, PAFedFV. This framework enhances the applicability of federated learning for finger vein recognition by designing personalized model aggregation to accommodate to heterogeneous non-IID finger vein data. Furthermore, an asynchronized training module is implemented within PAFedFV to effectively utilize clients’ waiting periods. Moreover, this paper reports extensive experiments conducted on six datasets. This paper also reports the performance of PAFedFV on six datasets. The experiment results show that our method is of highly accuracy and robustness, outperforms existing methods. Additionally, we investigate the impact of non-IID finger vein data with federated learning, and summarize the regularities that can be referenced by future research.</p>
