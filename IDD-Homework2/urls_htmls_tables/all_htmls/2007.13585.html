<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the strong analytical ability of big data, deep learning has been widely applied to model the collected data in industrial IoT. However, for privacy issues, traditional data-gathering centralized learning is not applicable to industrial scenarios sensitive to training sets. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it trains a model by only relying on gradient aggregation without accessing training sets. But existing researches reveal that the shared gradient still retains the sensitive information of the training set. Even worse, a malicious aggregation server may return forged aggregated gradients. In this paper, we propose the VFL, verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving for big data in industrial IoT. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to elaborately set interpolation points for verifying the correctness of the aggregated gradients. Compared with existing schemes, the verification overhead of VFL remains constant regardless of the number of participants. Moreover, we employ the blinding technology to protect the privacy of the gradients submitted by the participants. If no more than n-2 of n participants collude with the aggregation server, VFL could guarantee the encrypted gradients of other participants not being inverted. Experimental evaluations corroborate the practical performance of the presented VFL framework with high accuracy and efficiency.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence and industrial IoT has promoted the development of intelligent industry [1], [2], [40]. As a branch of artificial intelligence, due to strong capabilities in modeling, identification, and classification of big data [2], deep learning has been applied to solve data-driven problems in industrial IoT [41]. Nowadays, with the development of industry IoT and the popularity of intelligent products [3], [4], [18], [20], large amounts of data are generated by industry IoT systems and resided in various devices [25], which provides favorable conditions for training high-quality deep learning model. In order to effectively utilize these data, it is a desiderata of exploring deploy deep learning into end devices. Deep learning is hungry about data to increase, in particular, its accuracy, thus it is common practice to collect or share industrial data among different enterprises and institutions. However, these shared industrial data contain sensitive information [5], [16], [39], such as account information, case history, etc. Once these data are shared, clients cannot restrict the purpose for which it is used. For example, in the healthcare system, patients are least willing their diagnoses to be accessible to unauthorized third parties.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, there is a trend to strengthen data privacy to prevent misuse of it. The European Union enforced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25, 2018. It enforces enterprises to employ clarified language in the privacy agreements and reserves clients the right to delete or withdraw their data. In fact, these laws oblige data to be stored in the form of islands [14]. The inability to share data renders in hardness of training an accurate model without harvesting rich data. For medical institutions, each of them is restricted to train a model over the limited local data, such model is with unsatisfied accuracy and may not even be applicable to handle inputs from a different institution that are out of data feature distribution learned by the trained model. Therefore, the privacy issues and legislation put forward new requirements for effective deployment of deep learning to large-scale collaborative industrial applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the industrial data island issue resulted from by the laws and still utilize them legitimately, some secure centralized deep learning schemes have been proposed. In such schemes, the collected data are pre-encrypted [25], or pre-masked with noise [26]. Nevertheless, since the neural network requires nonlinear computation, it is difficult to mount deep learning on encrypted dataset [30], [23]. Training noise-added data is, however, usually accompanied with a trade-off of accuracy drop. Moreover, the computational overhead of secure centralized deep learning makes it extremely challenge to be applicable for large-scale industrial data and deep model structure that are commonly adopted to achieve high accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to secure centralized deep learning, Google proposed federated learning, a distributed deep learning framework in 2016 [7], [27], [28]. Federated learning only requires participant to share their gradients for aggregation rather than localized data directly. The main benefit is to protect privacy of localized data as they are inaccessible. Compared to centralized deep learning, federated learning avoids the processing of training sets, such as encryption, and improves efficiency. Therefore, federated learning has received widespread attention from both the academia and industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Though federated learning greatly reduces privacy leakage surface, it, however, still faces challenges of fundamentally preventing privacy leakage. Phong et al. [9] demonstrated that the aggregation server could approximate the local data by numerical methods. Wang et al. [11] designed the mGAN-AI (Generative Adversarial Network) model on the aggregation server to recover the original images of target participants. The gradients shared in plaintext is the main reason for these privacy issues. Recently, schemes built upon homomorphic encryption [35] have been proposed, where the gradients are aggregated in the form of ciphertext. But participants use the same secret key, if the aggregation server colludes with any participant to have the key, the ciphertext is no longer meaningful.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from privacy issues, inadvertently, most schemes ignored the verification of the correctness of the aggregated result [6]. Driven by certain illegal interests, the aggregation server may reduce the aggregation operation to save computational cost [12], or forge the aggregated result to impact the model update. Even worse, curious aggregation server could carefully return crafted results to participants for analyzing the statistical characteristics of participant-uploaded data and seduce participants to unintentionally expose more sensitive information [11]. Therefore, the effective verification of the aggregated result shall be always taken into consideration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose VFL, a verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving to achieve efficient and secure model training for industrial intelligent. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation and the blinding technology to achieve secure gradient aggregation. Meanwhile, we devise an efficient verification mechanism, where participants can detect forged results with an overwhelming probability. Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure centralized training means the server collects the training sets for training without gaining privacy. To protect the privacy of training sets, Li et al. [36] proposed a multi-key privacy-preserving deep learning in cloud computing, which realizes the conversion of multi-key homomorphic encryption [42] and double decryption mechanism [38] to enable the server trains the model on the ciphertext set. Li et al. [8] implemented naive Bayesian classifiers on multiple data sources using homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Xu et al. [26] proposed a differential privacy GAN scheme GANobfuscator, which achieves different privacy through GANs by adding carefully designed noise. The scheme generates synthetic data according to the training task instead of using real training data directly. Mohassel et al. [17] proposed the SecureML system based the ABY mixed-protocol [32] and oblivious transfer [34], where participants split their data and respectively sent them to two non-colluding servers to implement the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm by means of secure multi-party computation. Agrawal et al. [21] utilized key components of DNN training and improved upon the state-of-the-art in DNN training in two-party computation, which improved the efficiency and accuracy of centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Secure centralized training requires participant to process the training sets in advance, such as encrypting, adding noise or splitting, and performs training on the processed data. However, due to the complexity of the neural network model, it is inefficient for the server to train the processed data. Therefore, secure centralized training is not suitable for large-scale industrial applications.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from secure centralized training, secure distributed training assigns the training work to participants. Shokri et al. [19] firstly proposed the collaborative deep Learning framework, in which the participants share the gradients and update the model asynchronously. Google extended the framework to the parallel scene and proposed federated learning [7], [27], [28] that requires participants to upload gradients synchronously for aggregation. The two schemes prevent the server being directly access the training sets. Unfortunately, existing researches revealed that this could still lead to privacy breaches [11].</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Phone et al. [9] pointed out that the training sets can be recoveried form the gradients by numerical methods, and proposed to employ additively homomorphic encryption to realize secure aggregation. Li et al. [10] used the one-time mask technology to improve upon additively homomorphic encryption. The trainers and the introduced server-aid complete training on the ciphertext set through multiple interactions. Zhou et al. [15] deployed federated learning on the Internet of Things (IoT). The scheme not only protects the data security of IoT devices, but also improves the training efficiency and model accuracy. Abadi et al. [29] proposed a deep learning scheme with differential privacy, in which participants add Laplacian noise to gradients to satisfy differential privacy. Although the above schemes realize the secure gradient aggregation, they do not consider the verification of the aggregated results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Ma et al. [12] focused on the verifiable federated learning, they take advantage of bilinear aggregate signature [45] to verify the correctness of the aggregated results. Nevertheless, all the participants are required to join the verification process. When the number of participants is large, the verification mechanism results in high cost. Xu et al. [22] adopted the homomorphic hash function and Shamir’s secret sharing to realize secure gradient aggregation and verification. The scheme also supports participant drops, but it does not consider protecting the model. The aggregation server can get the final model, but in practice, only participants possess ownership of the model. Zheng et al. [13] proposed the Helen framework, which introduces a secure multi-party computing protocol SPDZ [31] to verify the result and employs multi-key homomorphic encryption to perform secure collaborative training of linear models. Nevertheless, it is specifically designed for linear models and thus dose not support training the models with nonlinear layers. Zhang et al. [37] took advantage of hash function [44] and Paillier encryption [43] to protect the gradients and verify the correctness of the aggregated results. But Paillier encryption brings high cost to participants. And the verification overhead of the scheme increases with the number of the participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Among secure distributed training schemes, few schemes have considered on the verifiability of federated learning. For the existing verifiable schemes, they are with limitations in terms of computational overhead or the type of models supported. Therefore, efficient and verifiable federated learning with non-linear model supporting is still a pressing concern.</p>

The objective of participants is to collaborate in training high-quality neural network models through federated learning. In each round of federated learning, each participant trains the model locally, encrypts their own gradients, and uploads it to the aggregation server. In addition, they receive the aggregated ciphertexts from the aggregation server, verify the correctness of it, and update the model. We assume that the participants are honest and curious, which means they will upload the correct gradient values. However, some participants may collude with the aggregation server in order to obtain the gradient of other participants.</p>

The increased security reduces the efficiency of the VFL. In addition, the encryption overhead of Phone’s scheme [9] (based on LWE encryption) and Ma’s scheme [12] (based on ElGamal encryption) are 8.178s and 19.741s, respectively. However, because all participants hold the same key, scheme [9] and [12] cannot resist the collusion attack. Therefore, our scheme has advantages in terms of encryption overhead and privacy protection.</p>

Therefore, the verification overhead of our scheme is insensitive to the number of participants. The scheme [12] employs bilinear aggregate signature to verify correctness. But all the participants are required to participate in the verification process. Therefore, our verification mechanism is more flexible. In addition, The scheme [12] requires that when the participants receive the aggregated result, they should firstly decrypt and then verify. If the aggregated result is forged, this would waste participants’ computing resources. Such a cumbersome is eschewed in the VFL which, in contrast, verifies first before decryption.</p>

In addition to the computational and communication overhead detailed earlier, the total overhead includes the overhead of training, updating models, and aggregating. In all schemes, participants use the same algorithm to train the model before encryption and update the model after decryption, so they have the same overhead of training and updating model.

In reality, the ID held by different banks has a small overlap. Fig. 10 presents the application of VFL in training risk assessment model. Multiple banks efficiently build a reliable and high-quality risk assessment model through collaboration without leaking the enterprise customer data. Moreover, each bank can independently verify whether the third party acting as the aggregation server forges the results to ensure the credibility of the model. On account of there is a competitive relationship between banks, VFL prevents data leakage in the case of collusion.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed the VFL, a privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning framework for industrial intelligent. The VFL framework exploits Lagrange interpolation to carefully set interpolation points, which allows each participant to verify the correctness of the aggregated result effectively. Compared with the exiting verifiable federated learning schemes, the computational overhead of our verification mechanism does not increase with the number of participants. Meanwhile, we take advantage of the blinding technique to protect the trained model and the private gradients of participants.

The experiment results on MNIST dataset demonstrated that the VFL provides advantages in terms of verification and total overhead. In the future work, we plan to study more complex neural networks and the data with richer classification labels.</p>
