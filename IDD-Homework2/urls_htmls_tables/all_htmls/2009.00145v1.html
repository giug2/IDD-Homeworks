<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires external knowledge beyond the visible content to answer questions about an image. This ability is challenging but indispensable to achieve general VQA. One limitation of existing KVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information without fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for reasoning the correct answer. How to capture the question-oriented and information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem.
Inspired by the human cognition theory, in this paper, we depict an image by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views. Thereinto, the visual graph and semantic graph are regarded as image-conditioned instantiation of the factual graph.
On top of these new representations, we re-formulate Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering as a recurrent reasoning process for obtaining complementary evidence from multimodal information. To this end, we decompose the model into a series of memory-based reasoning steps, each performed by a <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">G</span>raph-based <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R</span>ead, <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>pdate, and <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ontrol (<span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GRUC</span>) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">By stacking the modules multiple times, our model performs transitive reasoning and obtains question-oriented concept representations under the constrain of different modalities. Finally, we perform graph neural networks to infer the global-optimal answer by jointly considering all the concepts. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on three popular benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, and demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive experiments.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is an attractive research direction aiming to jointly analyze multimodal content from images and natural language. Equipped with the capacities of grounding, reasoning and translating, a VQA agent is expected to answer a question in natural language based on an image. Recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> have achieved great success in VQA tasks that are answerable by solely referring to the visible content. However, such kinds of models are incapable of answering questions which require external knowledge beyond the visible content.
Considering the question in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the agent not only needs to visually localize ‘red cylinder’, but also to semantically recognize it as ‘fire hydrant’ and connects the knowledge that ‘fire hydrant is used for firefighting’.
Therefore, how to collect question-oriented and information-complementary evidence from visual, semantic and knowledge perspectives is essential to achieve general VQA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To advocate research in this direction, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduces a Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) task, named as ‘Fact-based’ VQA (FVQA), for answering questions by joint analysis of the image and the knowledge base of facts. The typical solutions for FVQA build a fact graph with fact triplets filtered by the visual concepts in the image and select one entity in the graph as the answer.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2009.00145/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="322" height="241" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span><span id="S1.F1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">An illustration of our motivation. We represent an image by graphs to associate visual, semantic and factual knowledge corresponding to the objects and relationships. Cross-modal knowledge reasoning is conducted on the graphs to infer the optimal answer.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> parse the question as keywords and retrieve the supporting-entity only by keyword matching. This kind of approaches is vulnerable when the question does not exactly mention the visual concepts (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> synonyms and homographs) or the mentioned information is not captured in the fact graph (<span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> the visual attribute ‘red’ in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> may be falsely omitted). To resolve these problems, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> introduces visual information into the fact graph and infers the answer by implicit graph reasoning under the guidance of the question. However, they provide the whole visual information equally to each graph node by concatenation of the image, question and entity embeddings. Actually, only part of the visual content are relevant to the question and a certain entity.
Moreover, the fact graph here is still homogeneous since each node is represented by a fixed form of image-question-entity embedding, which limits the model’s flexibility of adaptively capturing evidence from different modalities. A model has to be selective by choosing relevant information and avoiding unexpected noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The recent proposed natural language understanding systems based on the cognition theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> are consistent in that our brain is capable to adaptively combine multimodal input for understanding and reasoning. As proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the understanding system contains two essential parts, where the neocortical sub-system (the blue box in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) is responsible for selectively integrating linguistic and non-linguistic input to understand the object and situation while the medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub-system (the red box in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) aims to store and learn from the integrated embeddings of the neocortical sub-system states. This understanding system is universal to tackle a wide range of natural language problems requiring external knowledge in multimodal format. In this perspective, KVQA problems can also be solved by this system by considering external knowledge in both linguistic (text and knowledge graph) and non-linguistic (image) format, which is flexible to choose task-relevant and content-complementary information for answer prediction.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F2" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2009.00145/assets/x2.png" id="S1.F2.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="322" height="248" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span><span id="S1.F2.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">The understanding system emulated by our model. The gray box contains information from multimodal sources. The blue box contains the neocortical sub-system, with each oval presenting an representation of a modal information. The blue arrows indicate learned connections that allow the representations to constrain each other. The red box contains the medial temporal lobe (MLT) sub-system, which stores and processes all the representations from the neocortical system. The red arrow represents self-connections that jointly consider all the representations for use. Green arrows connecting the red and blue ovals provide constraint between the two sub-systems.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the proposed structure of understanding system in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, we first introduce a novel scheme to depict an image by unifying the graph representation of different modalities, including the visual graph, semantic graph and fact graph. Specifically, the object appearance and their relationships are kept in the visual graph, the high-level abstraction is provided in the semantic graph and the corresponding factual knowledge is supported in the fact graph, which imitates distinct areas in neocortical sub-system that processes each input modality (the three blue ovals at bottom of neocortex). Graph representation is suitable for modeling the objects (entities) and their relationships of input and beneficial for connecting different modalities to constrain each other. Then we integrate cross-modal knowledge corresponding to the same concept (the blue oval at top of neocortex) by a series of memory-based reasoning steps. In order to select complementary knowledge from different modalities for integration, we propose a constraint satisfaction process in which the information in one modality influences the selection of information in another modality. To this end, we perform each reasoning step by a <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">G</span>raph-based <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R</span>ead, <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>pdate, and <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ontrol (<span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GRUC</span>) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information: the control unit updates the control signal for extracting a knowledge vector from the knowledge graphs (visual and semantic); the read unit generates the knowledge vector from the knowledge graphs upon the constrain of the control signal; the update unit integrates the knowledge vector into the control signal as well as the knowledge graph for memory update. After multiple reasoning steps, we obtain complementary evidence from different modalities and fuse them adaptively to reason about the global-optimal answer via a graph neural network, which can be seen as the learning system in MLT. The main contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(1) We novelly depict multimodal knowledge sources by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views, which unifies the representations of different modalities in graph domain and thus benefits for structure preserving and relational reasoning. Thereinto, introducing the semantic graph for high-level abstraction brings remarkable improvement in KVQA, which has been less studied in previous work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">(2) We propose a recurrent reasoning model that has three obvious novelties: First, it is a parallel reasoning model that applies modality-oriented controllers for reasoning over different modalities in a parallel mode, which can be easily extended to involve more modalities; Second, our model is designed for reasoning upon graph-structured multimodal data, aiming to consider the essential structural information in the reasoning process; Third, the basic reasoning module GRUC is a modular architecture consisting of Read, Update and Control units, which supports more explicit and structured reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">(3) The proposed model remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. Through ablative studies, we prove how each of the proposed components contributes to the improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">(4) The proposed model has good interpretability. It automatically tells which concept (entity) and modality (visual, semantic or factual) have more contributions to answer the question through visualization of attention weights in GRUC and gate values in the fusion process. Meanwhile, the model can also reveal the knowledge selection mode from different modalities according to the complexity of the questions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the agent to answer a question in natural language according to the visual content in an image, which demands for comprehending and reasoning about both visual and textual information.
The typical solutions for VQA are based on the CNN-RNN architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> that coarsely fuses the global visual and textual features as clues to predict the answer. For better combining textual information with visual information, bilinear pooling approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have been proposed to fuse multimodal features in fine-grained mode. However, the above approaches leverage all the information in the image and question, which may introduce redundant or noisy information to the prediction stage.
To alleviate this problem, various attention mechanisms have been exploited in VQA tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to highlight visual objects that are relevant to the question.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduced a bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism to learn the attention on candidate objects rather than spatial grids.
However, they treat objects in an image independently and ignore their informative relationships.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Humans’ ability of combinatorial generalization highly depends on the mechanisms of reasoning over relationships.
Consistent with such idea, there is an emerging trend to depict objects and visual relationships in an image by graph structure to support reasoning in VQA. One kind of approaches performs one-step relational reasoning to infer the answer. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a Relation Network (RN) to model all the implicit relationships among objects in the image by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Then, the relationships are summed and fed into other MLPs to predict the answer. This approach brings high computational cost and makes it hard to perform multi-step reasoning. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> refined the relationships by a ranking strategy and lowered the computational complexity. However, a large number of compound questions require multi-step reasoning. To this end, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed multi-step attention to reason over both original objects and new compound objects and infer the answer progressively. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> transformed both the visual and textual moldalities into concept-based graph representations and performed sequential reasoning over the graph by the neural state machine. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> exploited semantic captions to further enrich the graph-based representations for multi-step reasoning. Reasoning approaches in the above work are always on visual and textual features, which cannot be extended to involve external knowledge.
To go one step further, our model pays attention to not only original input features but also external knowledge
during progressive reasoning.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human easily combine visual observation with external knowledge for answering questions, which remains challenging for algorithms.
To bridge this discrepancy, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced a Fact-based VQA (FVQA) task, which additionally provides a knowledge base of facts and associates each question with a supporting-fact.
Recent works based on FVQA generally select one entity from fact graph as the answer and falls into two categories: query-mapping based methods and learning based methods.
On the one hand, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> reduced the question to one of the available query templates and this limits the types of questions that can be asked.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> automatically classified and mapped the question to a query which does not suffer this constraint.
Among both methods, however, visual information is used to extract facts but not introduced during the reasoning process.
On the other hand, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> learned a similarity score between the representations of fact and image-question pair.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> applied graph convolutional networks on the fact graph where each node is represented by the fixed form of image-question-entity embedding. However, the visual information is wholly provided which may introduce redundant information for reasoning the answer. The same problem also exists in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, although they leveraged dynamic memory network instead of graph convolutional netowrk to incorporate the external knowledge. Recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a new knowledge-based task OK-VQA and introduced a retrieval-based model to extract the correct answer from Wikipedia.
Different from previous work, in this paper, we decipt an image by multimodal kwnoledge graphs and perform cross-modal reasoning via a memory-based recurrent network to capture complementary evidence from different modalities.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The core module GRUC in our proposed model is a novel graph-based neural network. In this subsection, we briefly review related Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and highlight differences between previous work and ours. Approaches based on GNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> repeatedly perform a message passing process over the graph by aggregating and updating information between nodes. Relying on spectral graph theory, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> exploited simplified Chebyshev polynomials to construct localized polynomial filters for graph convolution in graph convolutional networks (GCN). Attention mechanisms have been introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to learn the weights over edges for convolution operations. Lanczos-based method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> has been explored for graph convolution for the purpose of acceleration. Our model is closely related to the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks (GGS-NN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> which updates GNNs by adding gated recurrent unit. Different from GGS-NN that both convolution operation and recurrent propagation are performed in the same graph, our GRUC module aggregates information from external knowledge graph for node updating and recurrent propagation in another fact graph.
Our model is also related to the heterogeneous graph neural networks since the model is reasoning over multimodal graphs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> generalized graph convolutional network to handle different relationships between entities in a knowledge base, where edges with distinct relationships are encoded independently.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed heterogeneous graph attention networks with dual-level attention mechanism.
All the above approaches model different types of nodes and edges in an unified graph.
In contrast, the heterogeneous graph in this work contains multiple layers of subgraphs and each layer consists of nodes and edges coming from different modalities. For this specific constrain, we propose the parallel reasoning model that applies modality-oriented controllers for reasoning over different modalities in a parallel mode.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key of cross-modal knowledge graph reasoning module is to reason on the fact graph by jointly considering all candidate facts. However, the entities in the fact graph provide insufficient knowledge to reason about the globally optimal answer which need to be complemented with correlated knowledge from other modalities. The process is performed by our proposed GRUC Network, a memory-based reasoning architecture by sequencing a recurrent Graph-based Read, Update and Control (GRUC) module. After multi-step reasoning, we fuse the multimodal knowledge for each entity and achieve more comprehensive understanding of an entity, which we rename it as ‘concept’ afterwards. The GRUC Network contains two components: a recurrent GRUC module and a multimodal feature fusion module, as introduced below.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The GRUC module aims to gather question-oriented knowledge from different modalities corresponding to the same concept.
However, it’s non-trivial to align the knowledge from different modalities to the same concept since there rarely exists explicit one-to-one mappings across modalities. Therefore, we propose to gather concept-relevant knowledge in an implicit way. Since the answer comes from one entity in the fact graph in this task, we regard each entity in the fact graph as a concept and gather complementary knowledge from the visual graph and the semantic graph to this concept in the fact graph in the GRUC module.
In this way, the recurrent GRUC modules can be performed over all the concepts in the fact graph in parallel and obtaining the relevant visual knowledge, semantic knowledge and fact knowledge for each concept as the output.</p>

The FVQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> consists of 2,190 images, 5,286 questions and a knowledge base of 193,449 facts. The knowledge base is constructed by extracting the top visual concepts from all the images in the dataset and querying those concepts from three knowledge bases, including DBPedia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, ConceptNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and WebChild <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. For each image-question pair in the dataset, the task aims to choose an entity in a supporting fact from the knowledge base as the answer by jointly considering the given question and image.</p>

However, most of questions of Visual7W solely base on the image content which don’t require external knowledge. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> generated a collection of knowledge-based questions based on the test images in Visual7W by filling a set of question-answer templates that need to reason on both visual content and external knowledge. We denoted this dataset as Visual7W+KB in our paper. In general, Visual7W+KB consists of 16,850 open-domain question-answer pairs based on 8,425 images in Visual7W test split. Different from FVQA, Visual7W+KB uses ConceptNet to guide the question generation but doesn’t provide a task-specific knowledge base. In our work, we also leverage ConceptNet to retrieve the supporting knowledge and select one entity as the predicted answer.</p>

Different from existing KVQA datasets, the questions in OK-VQA are manually generated by MTurk workers, which are not derived from specific knowledge bases. Therefore, it requires the model to retrieve supporting knowledge from open-domain resources, which is much closer to the general VQA but more challenging for existing models. OK-VQA contains 14,031 images which are randomly collected from MSCOCO dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, using the original 80k-40k training and validation splits as train and test splits. OK-VQA contains 14,055 questions covering a variety of knowledge categories such as science &amp; technology, history, and sports. In our work, we leverage ConceptNet to retrieve the supporting knowledge and select one entity as the predicted answer.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the question representation, each question is tokenized and each word is embedded using 300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. The maximum sentence length of question is set to 20 and questions shorter than 20 words are padded with zero vectors. The sequence of embedded words is then fed into LSTM and the dimension of the hidden layer in LSTM is set to 512.
For constructing the semantic graph, we first generate dense captions with DenseCap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Since some captions with low confidence are likely to introduce unexpected noise and too many captions will decrease the computation efficiency, we select top-12 dense captions with highest scores to eliminate unexpected noise caused by low confidence captions.
For the image representation, we extract 2048-dimensional object detection features, 4-dimensional spatial features, object labels with known bounding boxes from pre-trained Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> model in conjunction with ResNet-101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. The number of detected objects is fixed to 36. The Faster R-CNN model is trained over 1,600 selected object classes and 400 attribute classes, in a similar way as the bottom-up attention model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our GRUC model with state-of-the-art models on FVQA dataset. The baseline models can be classified into three sets, including CNN-RNN based approaches, semantic parsing based approaches and learning-based approaches. The CNN-RNN based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> include LSTM-Q+Image+Pre-VQA and Hie-Q+Image+Pre-VQA. The semantic parsing based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> include FVQA (top-3-QQmaping) and FVQA (Ensemble). The learning based approaches include Straight to the Facts (STTF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Out of the Box (OB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and Reading Comprehension based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our model consistently outperforms all the approaches on all the metrics and achieves remarkable 10.28% boost on top-1 accuracy and 10.95% boost on top-3 accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art model OB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The model OB is most relevant to GRUC in that it leverages graph convolutional networks to jointly assess all the entities in the fact graph. However, it introduces the global image features equally to all the entities without selection. By collecting question-oriented visual and semantic information via the memory-based recurrent reasoning network, our model gains remarkable improvement. It’s worth to note that our model outperforms Human performance by 1.64% on top-1 accuracy. To some extent, this results prove the effectiveness of the proposed understanding system in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> since our model is designed by emulating the structure of the proposed system. In other words, the model contains distinct modules that represent each input modality and computes the representation of concepts through a mutual constraint to combine linguistic and non-linguistic inputs. Emulating this architecture in model design could contribute to achieving human-level understanding ability.</p>

The VQA models contain Q-Only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, MLP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, BAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, MUTAN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. The knowledge-based VQA models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> consist of ArticleNet (AN), BAN+AN and MUTAN+AN. The ensemble models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, i.e. BAN/AN oracle and MUTAN/AN oracle, simply take the raw ArticleNet and VQA model predictions, taking the best answer (comparing to ground truth) from either. We report the overall performance (top-1 and top-3 accuracy) as well as breakdowns for each of the knowledge categories (top-1 accuracy). We have the following two observations from the results:</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, our model consistently outperforms all the compared models on the overall performance. Even the state-of-the-art models (BAN and MUTAN) specifically designed for VQA tasks, they get inferior results compared with ours. This indicates that general VQA task like OK-VQA cannot be simply solved by a well-designed model, but requires the ability to incorporate external knowledge in an effective way. Moreover, our model outperforms knowledge-based VQA models including both single models (BAN+AN and MUTAN+AN) and ensemble models (BAN/AN oracle and MUTAN/AN oracle), which further proves the advantages of our knowledge incorporating mechanism based on both multimodal knowledge graphs and memory-enhanced recurrent reasoning network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Second, the improvement of our model on OK-VQA is not that remarkable compared to the performance on FVQA and Visual7W-KB. We believe that this phenomenon is mostly due to the following two reasons: (1) Questions in the OK-VQA dataset are more diverse and complex, which is more challenging for machines to understand accurately. The questions in FVQA and Visual7W-KB are generated when given the images and supporting facts upon the pre-defined templates or relations. This mechanism constrains the answers in a specific knowledge base and guides the model to operate in a reverse way of the question generation process to predict the correct answers with high probability. On the contrary, questions in OK-VQA are totally free-form ones that generated by MTurk workers and thus containing more unique questions and words with less bias compared with other datasets. This increases the difficulty to understand the questions accurately. (2) OK-VQA requires a wide range of knowledge beyond a specific knowledge base. Looking at the category breakdowns in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3.3 Experimental results on OK-VQA ‣ 4.3 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, baseline models achieve relatively high performance for SR, CF, GHLC, PA and WC categories while our model performs better for the remaining categories. Since the baseline models refer to the Wikipedia while our model refers to ConceptNet, the performance in the category breakdowns perhaps suggests that each knowledge base just provides a portion of required knowledge. To improve the overall performance on OK-VQA, we should better comprehensively consider knowledge bases that cover commonsense, visual knowledge, Wikipedia knowledge and even professional knowledge.</p>

We observe that the top-1 and top-3 accuracy of ‘1’ and ‘2’ all decrease compared with the full model on the three datasets, which indicates that both semantic and visual graphs are beneficial to
provide valuable evidence for answer inference. Thereinto, the visual information has greater impact than the semantic part, proving that the image content still plays essential role in KVQA tasks. When removed both semantic and visual graphs, ‘3’ results in a significant decrease. It gives us insight that factual knowledge only is entirely insufficient to answer the question. By incorporating three of the knowledge modalities, we achieve the best performance.</p>

In most cases, factual knowledge provides predominant clues compared with other modalities from the observation of the ratio of gate values. It is because that KVQA tasks rely on external knowledge to a great extent. Furthermore, more evidence comes from the semantic modality when the question involves complex relationships. For instance, the question in the first case asking about single object ‘devise’ requires more visual information while the question in the second case involving the relationship between ‘hand’ and ‘while round thing’ needs more semantic clues.</p>

We find that 3 reasoning steps achieve the best performance on the all datasets. If the number of reasoning steps less than 3, the GRUC network cannot extract adequate knowledge from each memory to support the global assessment. In contrast, too many reasoning steps may lead to over-smoothing, leading to the features of nodes converging to the similar values. Therefore, we use this setting in our full model and the ablation models.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a graph-based recurrent reasoning network GRUC for visual question answering requiring external knowledge, which focuses on cross-modal knowledge reasoning upon graph-structured multimodal knowledge representations. We novelly depict multimodal knowledge sources by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views. The representations of different modalities are unified in graph domain, thus benefiting for relational reasoning across modalities. Meanwhile, introducing the semantic graph for high-level abstraction brings remarkable improvement in KVQA, which has been less studied in previous work. On top of these representations, we propose a new recurrent reasoning model and each reasoning step is performed by a Graph-based Read, Update, and Control (GRUC) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information. GRUC is a parallel reasoning module that applies modality-oriented controllers for reasoning over different modalities in a parallel mode, which can be easily extended to involve more modalities.
Our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches remarkably on FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA datasets. Furthermore, the model has good interpretability of revealing the knowledge selection mode from different modalities by comprehensive visualization.
However, our model has inferior performance when open-domain knowledge is required. How to adaptively incorporate diverse knowledge bases that covering commonsense, Wikipedia knowledge and even professional knowledge for KVQA tasks will be our future work.</p>
