<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">A platoon-based driving is a technology allowing vehicles to follow each other at close distances to, e.g., save fuel. However, it requires reliable wireless communications to adjust their speeds. Recent studies have shown that the frequency band dedicated for vehicle-to-vehicle communications can be too busy for intra-platoon communications. Thus it is reasonable to use additional spectrum resources, of low occupancy, i.e., secondary spectrum channels. The challenge is to model the interference in those channels to enable proper channel selection. In this paper, we propose a two-layered Radio Environment Map (REM) that aims at providing platoons with accurate location-dependent interference models by using the Federated Learning approach. Each platoon is equipped with a Local REM that is updated on the basis of raw interference samples and previous interference model stored in the Global REM. The model in global REM is obtained by merging models reported by platoons. The nodes exchange only parameters of interference models, reducing the required control channel capacity. Moreover, in the proposed architecture platoon can utilize Local REM to predict channel occupancy, even when the connection to the Global REM is temporarily unavailable. The proposed system is validated via computer simulations considering non-trivial interference patterns.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A platoon-based driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a technology allowing vehicles to follow each other at short distances, i.e., of a few meters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. There are several significant benefits originating from this innovative approach. First, due to short inter-car distances, the road capacity can be improved by placing more vehicles on the road <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Second, vehicles following each other benefit from better aerodynamic conditions. This further implies fuel savings, and reduction of emitted pollution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Most important, those gains from the platoon-based driving pattern are achieved with no need for additional road infrastructure, e.g., expensive and time-consuming building of additional road lanes. One, typically first, vehicle in the platoon is a so-called platoon leader. Depending on the concept, it can be either an autonomous vehicle or a vehicle with a human driver <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. In most cases, the platoon leader is responsible for the platoon behavior, and other vehicles not only adjust their speed to the platoon leader but also follow its maneuvers, e.g., line change. However, it is a non-trivial task, especially, when the platoon leader is forced to sudden breaking. Research has shown that for the purpose of safe driving while maintaining short inter-vehicle distances, it is not enough to rely on the onboard sensors or cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Additionally, reliable wireless communication must be established between the vehicles within the platoon to exchange control information, e.g., messages related to speed adjustment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. There are several protocols already defined that are aimed at wireless communications between vehicles (known as a vehicle-to-vehicle scheme, V2V), between vehicles and network infrastructure (called vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, V2I), and between vehicles and pedestrians (named vehicle-to-pedestrians V2P) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These are collectively referred to as vehicles-to-everything (named widely V2X). In general, the idea of V2X communications can be realized either in a centralized way with the use of cellular technology (i.e., Cellular-V2X, C-V2X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>), or in a distributed fashion by means of, e.g., Dedicated-Short-Range-Communication (DSRC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The DSRC solution can utilize 802.11p and Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standards, in physical, and medium access layers, respectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Although there are dedicated frequency bands for both DSRC and C-V2X, these might not be sufficient when road traffic is high. Some research has shown that with a growing number of vehicles utilizing DSRC interference in this part of the spectrum will drastically grow, decreasing the reliability of the wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Similar results were observed for C-V2X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. The low reliability is caused by the fact that under the high level of interference the DSRC and C-V2X-dedicated frequency bands will not be able to ensure the capacity of the wireless channel required by the platoon. This would further imply a need to increase the inter-vehicle spaces within the platoon to prevent potential intra-platoon crashes causing e.g., lower fuel savings. This contradicts the overall concept of a platoon-based driving pattern discussed above.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, it seems reasonable to look for alternative frequency bands where intra-platoon communication can be offloaded. Although almost all frequency bands are assigned to some wireless systems, the majority of these spectral resources are underutilized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, the frequency availability can vary with location or time. A platoon can potentially use a frequency band if it is not used at a given time in a given location. This requires detecting the radio activities of the so-called primary users (PUs), who are licensed to transmit in a particular frequency band. If PUs activity is not detected in this frequency band, this part of the spectrum can be opportunistically used by other systems. This approach is known in the literature as a Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and when it relates to V2X communications, the Vehicle DSA (VDSA) scenario is then considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In our work, we concentrate on the latter scheme.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Detection of the PU’s signal presence may be done by means of the so-called spectrum sensing (such as energy detection). However, stand-alone spectrum sensing has limited performance. In addition, knowledge about the radio environment is out-dates fast as a result of vehicle movement in VDSA. An entity that can be used to retain and aggregate knowledge about the radio environment is a database called a Radio Environment Map (REM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The REM stores, updates, and process location-dependent information about the present PU’s signal, which from the perspective of the unlicensed, so-called secondary user (SU) may be treated as interference. Such processing of historical data about interference possibly from many devices provides more insight into the availability of secondary spectrum channels. Moreover, please note that REMs may save also information about other ongoing SU transmissions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The main challenge while utilizing a REM for VDSA is accurate modeling of interference caused by PU’s signals along the route of the vehicle. In this context, the state-of-the-art models of interference utilized by REM are very simple, i.e., they characterize observed PU’s signal power in a given location by its first-order statistics - the mean received power of unwanted signal  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Such a simple approach was reliable enough when DSA was applied to the terrestrial television band, as the transmitted digital terrestrial television (DTT) signals are stable over frequency and time. However, in the general case, especially when unlicensed bands are considered, the PUs can utilize various algorithms for medium access controls and different transmission schemes. In such situations, more sophisticated models must be used to deal with complex interference distributions. This observation fits well with the considered VDSA scheme, where the observed unwanted signal distributions vary as a function of the road (location) and time. The creation of stable and precise models of unwanted signals may be time-consuming, and in practice, only a limited number of interference samples can be collected at one time. Thus, proper mechanisms for updating interference models in REM must be proposed. These mechanisms should be designed so as to enable the simultaneous contribution of several data sources, e.g., multiple platoons.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to deal with potentially complex distributions of interference generated by PUs, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> will be used. GMM can model a Probability Density Function (PDF) of interference samples power, as a weighted sum of Gaussian distribution PDFs. Based on the model a wireless channel capacity can be calculated and the optimal frequency obtained using the algorithm proposed by us in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, that paper did not deal with a merger of knowledge from many sources. As the GMM model of interference varies in space, we proposed to store GMM-location pairs in the REM. Moreover, we propose a two-layer architecture of REM dedicated for VDSA, consisting of a Global, and a Local REM respectively. In our approach platoons can download the estimated GMM from Global REM to its Local REM, and update Local REM during ride based on local spectrum sensing. Later on, the locally updated GMM models from potentially many platoons are sent back to the Global REM to be merged into a single model therein. Such an architecture is enabled via Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
We confirm the effectiveness of this scheme via computer simulations and compare it against local sensing.
The local interference modeling, without REM utilization, provides much worse insight into the distribution of interference for the platoon. Moreover, we show that the more platoons contribute to the update of Global REM the higher accuracy interference models can be obtained.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, when discussing the CQA, the challenge is to choose the proper evaluation metric. From the perspective of overall communications reliability, one of the most important aspects is to monitor the latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, it is not straightforward to estimate it, as latency highly depends on the utilized radio access technology and medium access protocol. Both are in general not known when considering secondary spectrum channels, especially when many systems of different radio access technologies may operate. Moreover, according to the state-of-the-art models to assess latency, the knowledge of the arrival rate distribution of the incoming packets is necessary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Its estimation is also case-dependent.
On the other hand, a well-established metric is the Shannon capacity of a wireless channel being the upper bound estimate of the real system throughput. This metric is irrespective of the properties of the particular communication system, e.g., medium access control, and modulation schemes. Thus, in this paper, we follow this approach to assess channel quality.</p>

This observation can be applied to the communication between the platoon leader, and the last vehicle in a platoon consisting of a few vehicles, e.g. 3-4. As a result we expect channel to be relatively stable and flat. On the other hand interference in secondary spectrum potentially comes from the variety of sources having different transmission schemes. Therefore, our main focus is on the interference impact on the channel capacity.</p>

To obtain parameters of a random distribution it is common to use a closed-form maximum likelihood estimator, i.e., closed form expressions are computed through maximization of the likelihood function. Unfortunately. in the case of GMM the log-likelihood function is a sum over the exponential functions, and no closed-form estimator exists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Instead an iterative algorithm named Expectation Maximization (EM) is widely in use <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">From the perspective of spectrum management and the best channel selection, the REM may be treated as an intelligent database containing location-dependent information about various signal sources (both, wanted and of interference type) observed in the wireless communication system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The users can communicate with REM via a side link to e.g. obtain information about the interference related to their positions or provide REM with their own measurement data. The entries in the database may have various forms, from raw measurements to some averaged figures of merit such as averaged received power in the band of interest.
Although such REM databases may be applied to any frequency band and to any application, in the context of DSA the terrestrial television band was often in focus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. In this frequency band, the interference is usually homogeneous, i.e., it has a stable average level over time and at a given location. In such a case, the interference can be easily modeled by the average power of the observed signal. However, as already mentioned, this idea can be extended to build a REM database capable of modeling more complicated distributions, e.g., with interference power varying in time and frequency. Mainly, instead of average power, the parameters of GMMs related to the secondary spectrum channels <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{I}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ℐ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">ℐ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math> can be stored for each location <math id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{x}_{l}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">𝐱</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">l</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐱</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑙</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathbf{x}_{l}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Once processed locally, they will be used for updating the global REM, when the link to it is available.
The idea behind the two-layered REM architecture aims at increasing the reliability of the system. While every platoon has its own Local REM, it can still use the interference models even when the side link to the Global REM is temporarily unavailable. Local REM is being updated on the basis of the raw samples, associated with the local environment, so it can reflect the current situation in the network and update the received model accordingly. As mentioned above, Local REM may also contribute to updating the Global REM models by sending back local observations or trained parameters. However, as the Local REM contains the whole GMM model it is enough to send only the model parameters to the Global REM instead of raw measurements. This results in significant traffic load reduction, i.e., order of tens parameters per GMM model vs hundreds of captured raw samples that have to be sent over the side link.
Such an approach is inspired by the popular federated learning scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, where the trained model details are exchanged between the central and surrounding nodes in order to better train the model and better reflect the local environment observed by each node. The procedure of secondary spectrum channel selection which utilizes interference modeling based on REM and FL is summarized in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3.1 REM For Interference Modeling ‣ 3 REM and Federated Learning for Interference modeling ‣ Federated Learning-Based Interference Modeling for Vehicular Dynamic Spectrum AccessThe work has been realized within project no. 2018/29/B/ST7/01241 funded by the National Science Centre in Poland." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

It can be seen that the channels marked as the best on the basis of the interference model from REM cover up with the ones computed using the baseline model in all cases, which is highly expected and proves the correctness of the proposed method. On the other hand, results based on SAIM correctly indicate the best radio channels only in 24 out of 30 platoon locations. It means that on the basis of only currently available interference samples the best secondary spectrum channel can be selected only in 80 % of cases. It is important to note that such a mistake can have a significant impact on the quality of wireless communications between vehicles formulating a platoon. This can further imply decreased fuel saves or platoon crash in extreme case.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a two-layer architecture of REM, that together with FL and local spectrum sensing can be effectively used to provide platoons with an accurate model of interference. We have shown that the GMM accurately models the non-trivial distributions of interference in VDSA scenarios.
Through the extensive computer simulations studies, we came to conclusion that historical data from REM can much improve the accuracy of interference models used by the platoon to predict radio channel occupancy in relation to the state-of-the-art SAIM approach. Moreover, it has been observed, that due to utilization of the FL multiple platoons can contribute to the improvement of Global REM interference models even more. Up to <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="4.5" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">4.5</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">4.5</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">4.5</annotation></semantics></math> fold reduction in channel capacity estimate RMSE was observed while comparing algorithm based on REM and FL against standard SAIM approach. It is important to notice that the proposed two-layer REM architecture have low requirements on the capacity of control channel. This is because only the GMM parameters are exchanged between the Local and the Global REM, instead of direct spectrum sensing results. Finally, equipping every platoon with Local REM ensures that channel capacity can be predicted even, when the side link to the Global REM is temporarily unavailable. What increases the system’s reliability. In the future the measurement campaign can be conducted in order to verify the proposed algorithms in real-world scenario.</p>
