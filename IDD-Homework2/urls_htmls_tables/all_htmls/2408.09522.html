<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Devices located in remote regions often lack coverage from well-developed terrestrial communication infrastructure. This not only prevents them from experiencing high quality communication services but also hinders the delivery of machine learning services in remote regions. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning (FL) methodology tailored to space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) to tackle this issue. Our approach strategically leverages the nodes within space and air layers as both (i) edge computing units and (ii) model aggregators during the FL process, addressing the challenges that arise from the limited computation powers of ground devices and the absence of terrestrial base stations in the target region. The key idea behind our methodology is the adaptive data offloading and handover procedures that incorporate various network dynamics in
SAGINs, including the mobility, heterogeneous computation powers, and inconsistent coverage times of incoming satellites. We analyze the latency of our scheme and develop an adaptive data offloading optimizer, and also characterize the theoretical convergence bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results confirm the advantage of our SAGIN-assisted FL methodology in terms of training time and test accuracy compared with various baselines.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the proliferation of edge devices, including mobile phones, smart vehicles, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, continues to escalate, they generate vast quantities of data at the wireless edge. In response to this surge, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has emerged as a powerful method for harnessing these distributed data sources to train machine learning (ML) models. Over recent years, FL has garnered significant attention and has been rigorously explored across various configurations: from single-server environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, hierarchical structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, to decentralized networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advances in FL frameworks, they mostly rely heavily on terrestrial communication infrastructures for model aggregation
during the training process. This reliance renders most existing FL methods unsuitable for areas lacking terrestrial communication facilities. Specifically, many remote regions of the Earth, such as mountains, forests, deserts, and coastal areas, do not have well-developed base stations, even though they are home to numerous ground devices, such as IoT sensors, that collect valuable data. The data gathered in these locations are essential for the development of intelligent services tailored to a variety of applications:
(i) Disaster predictions in coast, mountain, and forest areas that lack a base station. To achieve this, FL over data samples collected from various types of sensor devices in these remote regions is required. (ii) Autonomous vehicle applications in rural regions. Since these regions have different traffic patterns compared to urban areas, FL needs to be conducted over data samples of vehicles in rural regions. (iii) Medical applications, which is one of the key use cases of FL. Hospitals located in different areas of the world may want to collaboratively train a global model for disease prediction. In such cases, hospitals located in rural regions can take advantage of satellites based on our approach. (iv) Smart agriculture across farms where a well-developed terrestrial base station is unavailable. In this use case, FL should be conducted using data samples collected from different farms.
Decentralized FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, although designed to mitigate some of these challenges, encounter significant obstacles in environments where communication links between devices are unreliable or non-existent, as often found in disaster-affected or maritime regions. Consequently, there is a need for an FL methodology that is specifically
tailored to
remote areas, ensuring that the distributed data collected in those regions can be leveraged to develop intelligent services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) have recently emerged as a groundbreaking solution within the wireless communications community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, aimed at extending wireless coverage across the globe, particularly in isolated and remote regions. In addition to the terrestrial nodes located at the <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ground layer</span>,
SAGINs leverage satellites in the <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">space layer</span> and air nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in the <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">air layer</span>. This multi-layered architecture enables SAGINs to either complement or entirely supplant traditional terrestrial networks in delivering communication services.
Furthermore, SAGINs are not limited to providing mere connectivity; they also have the potential to act as edge computing platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In particular, they can undertake computation tasks offloaded from terrestrial, resource-constrained devices, such as IoT sensors.
The integration of SAGINs thus promises not only to bridge the connectivity gap in underserved areas but also to enhance the computational capabilities at the network edge, opening new avenues for advanced applications and services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the capabilities of SAGINs, this paper sets out to explore the orchestration of FL within SAGINs to facilitate FL in remote areas. This brings forth a set of novel challenges that are absent in conventional FL implementations over terrestrial networks. Our investigation is driven by
research questions aimed at unlocking the full potential of FL in the context of SAGINs.
First, how should we optimally utilize the unique components of SAGINs, including satellites, air nodes, and ground devices, during the FL process? Second, how should we address the network dynamics in SAGINs (e.g., dealing with the mobility, varying computation capacities, and the inconsistent coverage times provided by satellites)
during FL? Third,
can we theoretically guarantee the convergence of FL despite the inherent challenges of SAGINs, such as variable network conditions and limited connectivity? Despite the importance of deploying FL in remote regions
for intelligent service development,
these questions have been largely overlooked in existing research.
Our goal is thus to fill this gap by providing insights and solutions that enable effective FL over SAGINs.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a FL methodology that takes advantage of both computation and communication resources of space/air/terrestrial nodes in SAGINs to provide intelligent ML services over remote areas. Compared to prior
FL methods that rely on base stations,
our approach strategically leverages the space and air nodes as both (i) edge computing units and (ii) ML model aggregators during the FL process, to address the challenges arising from the limited computation powers of ground devices and the absence of terrestrial base stations in the target remote region. Under this framework, we propose an adaptive approach to <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">optimize data offloading</span> depending on the network dynamics of SAGINs, including the inconsistent computation capabilities and coverage times of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites.
Considering the mobility of LEO satellites, we also propose an <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">optimized data/model handover strategy</span> where each satellite transmits the trained model and its dataset to the next incoming satellite to ensure a seamless ML model training process.

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL over terrestrial networks:</span> FL has been actively studied in terrestrial networks where the server (e.g., base station) aggregates the client models in the system. Most of them consider a single-server setup
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> while some researchers also study multi-server scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors investigate decentralized FL where each client aggregates the models via device-to-device communications with its adjacent clients, without relying on the server.
Data offloading strategies are also studied in FL where each client offloads a portion of its local dataset to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. However, prior works on FL are mostly inapplicable in remote regions, where well-developed base stations are not available and communication links between devices are unstable (e.g., disaster or maritime regions).
Compared to these works, we facilitate FL in remote areas by strategically leveraging non-terrestrial network elements, specifically SAGINs.</p>

After the local training procedure at UAVs or satellites, model aggregation and synchronization are conducted relying on the ground base station <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> or directly at the UAVs/satellites <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. The problem setup of these studies differs from ours as we focus on FL over data samples collected at ground devices located in remote regions. This necessitates interaction between ground devices and nodes in the space/air layers not only for model aggregation (to address the lack of base stations in remote regions) but also for computation offloading (to tackle the limited computation capabilities of ground devices).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> have focused on the setting where ground devices collect data and conduct FL assisted by the UAVs/satellites, similar to our problem setup. Specifically in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, the satellite aggregates the models of ground devices via over-the-air aggregation, without requiring any base stations. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> focus on solving the maze problem using the deep Q network assisted by the satellites. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, data offloading has been studied for satellite-assisted FL by considering only the space layer. While these works do not consider SAGINs, a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> specifically studied FL considering space-air-ground layers.
However, the nodes in space and air layers are only used as model aggregators, not as edge computing units. Compared to all prior works, the contribution of this work is to adaptively optimize data offloading across different layers and handover within the space layer, while taking into account the network dynamics specific to SAGINs (e.g., heterogeneous coverage time and resource availability of current/incoming satellites) during FL.</p>

Compared to existing studies on SAGINs, the unique position of this work lies in the integration of distributed/federated ML, SAGINs, and adaptive data offloading/handover.
Beyond enhancing wireless coverage, we provide additional guidelines for intelligent ML services in remote areas with the assistance of SAGINs.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are several key challenges in achieving the above goal in remote areas. First, it is difficult to aggregate the trained models within such regions without a base station. Secondly, the terrestrial devices (e.g., IoT sensors) are often equipped with low computation capabilities, significantly slowing down the training process. In this work, we use space and air nodes as model aggregators to solve the first challenge, and also use them as edge computing units to process data samples offloaded from the ground layer, to tackle the second challenge.</p>

Intuitively, if the current/incoming satellites have relatively high computation powers, more data samples can be offloaded to the space layer. Otherwise, data samples should be transmitted from the space layer to other layers for load balancing. The data offloading solution is also affected by the coverage times of the satellites over the target region.</p>

In satellite networks, satellites are perceived as non-stationary units, where at each snapshot of the network each LEO satellite covers a different region
compared to other LEO satellites and may have its own specific task tailored to its coverage area (e.g., edge computing, FL, or communication services). In our setup, the current satellite that is covering the target area is responsible for conducting FL over that region. However, a key challenge is that each satellite has a limited coverage time over the target region due to the mobility. This motivates us to consider an intra-layer data/model handover strategy within the space layer, to ensure a seamless FL process. Specifically, the current satellite transmits the updated model and dataset to the incoming satellite before leaving the target region, so that this new satellite can continue model training in the space layer using dataset <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D_{\textsf{S}}^{(r+1)}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml">D</mi><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_sans-serif" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3a.cmml">S</mtext><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">r</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.2">𝐷</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3a.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_sans-serif" mathsize="70%" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.3">S</mtext></ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><plus id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></plus><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑟</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">D_{\textsf{S}}^{(r+1)}</annotation></semantics></math> during its coverage period over the target region.

Satellites and air nodes are only used to aggregate the updated models. This baseline represents the majority of existing works that do not involve data offloading. Secondly, we consider optimizing data offloading only between the air and ground layers. Hence, the satellite-side computation power is not utilized during local model updates. Similarly, we optimize data offloading only between ground and space layers, without using the computational capabilities of air nodes during local update. We also consider the static optimization scheme, which applies our optimization strategy only at the initial global round and keeps the same solution throughout the remaining FL process. This baseline utilizes the computational resources of all three layers of SAGINs and is considered to see the impact of adaptive data offloading instead of using a fixed solution. Finally, we consider another baseline that utilizes the resources of all layers of SAGINs, where the number
of data samples processed at each node is proportional to its computational power. For a fair comparison, we use FedAvg to aggregate the models in all baseline schemes and our methodology.</p>

Our key takeaways are as follows. First, the scheme without data offloading achieves slow convergence, since the computation resources of space and air nodes are not utilized in this method. Utilizing only the computation resources of ground devices causes delays. We also observe that the fixed data offloading scheme achieves relatively low performance since the varying resource availability at the satellites are not considered in the scheme. If too many or too few data samples are offloaded to the space layer, the training process can be slowed down. This highlights the importance of adaptively optimizing data offloading, instead of relying on a fixed solution. We see that our approach, which leverages both the space and air layers, attains superior performance compared to the baselines that utilize only one of these layers. The proposed scheme also outperforms the scheme with optimized fixed data offloading and the baseline that conducts data offloading proportional to the computational power of each node in SAGINs. Further ablation studies on the effect of each layer are provided in the next subsection. The overall results highlight the significance of (i) inter-layer data offloading across space-air-ground, and (ii) adaptively conducting this to account for the network dynamics in SAGINs.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a distributed ML methodology that orchestrates FL in space-air-ground integrated networks. The core idea was to take advantage of both computation and communication resources of different layers in SAGINs to facilitate/accelerate FL in remote regions. We analytically characterized the latency of our method, and proposed an adaptive data offloading solution to minimize the training time depending on the current resource availability. We also derived the convergence bound of the scheme and guaranteed convergence to a stationary point for non-convex loss functions. The advantages of the proposed method as well as the effects of system parameters are investigated via simulations.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are several promising directions for future research in this domain. One direction is to optimize the trajectories of air nodes to achieve a better performance within our framework. Another direction is to introduce an additional layer by considering the base stations or geostationary earth orbit satellites that can connect to the LEO satellites, to further enhance the performance.</p>
