<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a method to obtain robust explanations for visual question answering(VQA) that correlate well with the answers. Our model explains the answers obtained through a VQA model by providing visual and textual explanations. The main challenges that we address are i) Answers and textual explanations obtained by current methods are not well correlated and ii) Current methods for visual explanation do not focus on the right location for explaining the answer. We address both these challenges by using a collaborative correlated module which ensures that even if we do not train for noise based attacks, the enhanced correlation ensures that the right explanation and answer can be generated. We further show that this also aids in improving the generated visual and textual explanations. The use of the correlated module can be thought of as a robust method to verify if the answer and explanations are coherent. We evaluate this model using VQA-X dataset. We observe that the proposed method yields better textual and visual justification that supports the decision. We showcase the robustness of the model against a noise-based perturbation attack using corresponding visual and textual explanations. A detailed empirical analysis is shown. Here we provide source code link for our model <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">https://github.com/DelTA-Lab-IITK/CCM-WACV</span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we solve for obtaining robust explanations for visual question answering. Visual question answering is a semantic task that aims to answer questions based on an image. The practical implication for this task is that of an agent answering questions asked by, for instance, a visually impaired person that wants to know answers. An important aspect related to this model is the ability to reason whether the model is able to really understand and provide explanations for its answer. This aspect was investigated, for instance, by a recent method by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where the authors proposed a method to generate textual explanations and also provide localizations that contribute to the explanation for their answer. This was obtained by their approach which generates explanations based on the answer attention. However, one drawback we observe for such an approach is that the explanation need not be correct. For instance, using a noise based perturbation on the image, we can have instances of answer and explanation being different. We solve this by jointly generating the answer and explanation. We further improve over this method by proposing a novel method that enhances the correlation by verifying that the answer and explanation do agree with each other. This is obtained through a collaborative correlated network. This concept is illustrated in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Robust Explanations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> where we show that current methods can generate answers and explanations. However, these may diverge for an image corrupted using noise based perturbation. Our proposed method aids in generating robust explanations that are tolerant of such perturbation though our methods are not trained using such noise at the time of training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We investigate various other ablations of the system, such as verifying whether the answer is correct or the explanation is correct or separately verifying that the answer and explanations are correct. These variations are illustrated in figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Robust Explanations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We observe that jointly verifying that the answer and explanations are correct and agree with each other is better than all the other variations. This is termed as a collaborative correlation module as the answer and explanation collaboratively are checked. This module not only aids in generating better textual explanations but also helps to generate better localization for the visual explanation. It also ensures the coherence of answer and explanation generation.</p>

Recently, the author  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> has proposed a new paradigm of providing visual explanation using uncertainty based class activation map. Furthermore, a variety of works proposed methods to visually explain decisions. The method that is closest to our work is the recent work by  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Their work aims at generating explanations and also providing visual justification for their answer. None of the methods checks robustness. To the best of our knowledge, we are raising a new novel issue related to the robustness of the prediction and explanation that has not been previously considered in the literature. Our work is inspired by this effort and aims to provide a more robust and coherent explanation generation, which is verified experimentally.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Interpretability of models through explanation does not consider the robustness and consistency of the provided explanations. While providing interpretability for understanding models is important, ensuring that the same are robust and consistent is also crucially important. We are specifically investigating this problem and provide a simple framework to solve for the same.
The main focus of our approach is to ensure correctness and correlation in visual question answering(VQA). We propose a correlated network that learns joint embedding by collaborating with textual explanation and answer embedding. The key difference between our architecture and other existing VQA architectures is in the use of a mutually collaborating module for explanation and answering blocks in a joint adversarial mechanism. This is illustrated in figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Robust Explanations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The other aspects of VQA and explanation are retained as it is. In particular, we adopt a classification based approach for solving VQA where an image embedding is combined with the question embedding to solve for the answer. This is done using a softmax function in a multiple choice setting:</p>

Correlated Answer Module (CAM) only corrects altered answers, Correlated Explanation Module (CEM) only corrects altered explanations, Answer and Explanation Correlated Module (AECM) corrects answers and explanations separately and Collaborative Correlated Module (CCM) corrects both answers and explanations jointly.
<br class="ltx_break">CCM comprises of three modules: Encoder Module, Generator Module, and Correlated Module. The Encoder Module encodes images and questions using CNN and LSTM. We combine these two using an attention mechanism to obtain an attention feature. Using the attention feature, the generator module predicts answers and explanations that justify the predicted answer. The Correlated module defends the model against perturbations in the input, which facilitates the model to predict correct answers even under perturbation though we do not perturb the input at the time of training. Details of each module are as follows:</p>

Using the adversarial mechanism, we develop a Collaborative Correlated Module which simultaneously checks whether the predicted answer and the corresponding explanation are correct or not. Each time the model predicts a wrong answer, the correlated module tries to correct it by comparing it with the real answer and the corresponding real explanation. Our correlated module includes Correlated Answer Module, Correlated Explanation Module and Collaborative Correlated Module. Each of the correlated modules are explained as follows:

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our proposed CCM method using quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative evaluation is conducted using standard metrics like BLEU  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, METEOR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, ROUGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and CIDEr <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. We evaluate our attention maps using rank correlation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. We further consider the statistical significance for the many ablations as well as the state-of-the-art models. In qualitative analysis, we show the word statistics of generated explanation with a Sunburst plot in figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2.2 Analysis on Visual Explanation ‣ 4.2 Ablation Analysis ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust Explanations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.
We provide gradual improvement in visualization of attention maps for a few images as we move from our base model to CCM model. We perform ablation analysis based on various samples of noise.</p>

We add noise in image features by introducing gaussian noise with increasing noise intensity. Noise in questions is added by randomly masking question words with increasing probability of masking shown in column-2. Finally we add noise in both image features and question with increasing intensity/probability shown in column-3. Purple line shows performance of our model(CCM). It can be observed that our model perturbs least as compared to other models and hence it is robust as compared to other models.

Humans are robust to such noise since we can extract the semantic meaning of a sentence even if some words are masked or missing. So we test our model on this noise and observe that our model follows the previous trend. Then, we add both image and question noise with increasing magnitude. We again observe that our model outperforms all other models and it perturbs least.

We configure hyper-parameters of Generator module using the validation set which are as follows: learning rate = 0.0007, batch size = 64, alpha = 0.99, beta = 0.95, and epsilon = 1e-8. For correlated module, the hyper-parameters are as follows: learning rate = 0.0007 and momentum = 0.9.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we solve for a method that can generate textual and visual explanations for visual question answering. The proposed method introduces a collaborative correlated module that ensures that generated textual explanations and answers are coherent with each other and are robust to perturbation in image and text. We provide a detailed evaluation that compares the accuracy of the answers and various standard metrics for the generated textual and visual explanations. We observe that while our model generates comparable accuracies for answer generation, the generated textual and visual explanations are more coherent and are robust against perturbation. Our explanations change when there is a change in answer and hence signifies the importance of image and question in robustness of our model.
In the future, we would consider ways for obtaining improved insights while solving challenging vision and language based tasks building upon the proposed work.
