<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-aware paradigm that allows multiple clients to jointly train a model without sharing their private data. Recently, many studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">membership inference attacks</span> (MIAs) that can distinguish the training members of the given model from the non-members. However, existing MIAs ignore the source of a training member, <span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the information of which client owns the training member, while it is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond membership privacy of examples from all clients. The leakage of source information can lead to severe privacy issues. For example, identification of the hospital contributing to the training of an FL model for COVID-19 pandemic can render the owner of a data record from this hospital more prone to discrimination if the hospital is in a high risk region. In this paper, we propose a new inference attack called <span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">source inference attack</span> (SIA), which can derive an optimal estimation of the source of a training member. Specifically, we innovatively adopt the Bayesian perspective to demonstrate that an honest-but-curious server can launch an SIA to steal non-trivial source information of the training members without violating the FL protocol. The server leverages the prediction loss of local models on the training members to achieve the attack effectively and non-intrusively. We conduct extensive experiments on one synthetic and five real datasets to evaluate the key factors in an SIA, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed source inference attack.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Big data and deep learning technologies have enabled us to perform scalable data mining across multiple parties to build powerful prediction models. For example, it will be very appealing for different countries to collaborate, utilizing their medical data records to train prediction models for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many countries or regions have issued strong privacy protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and it is very difficult to straightforwardly collect and combine the data from different parties for a data mining task. To circumvent this major obstacle towards big data mining, a novel machine learning (ML) paradigm named feaderated learning (FL) has recently been proposed, which allows multiple clients coordinated by a central server to train a joint ML model in an iterative manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In FL, no client can access any training data owned by other clients, leading to a privacy-aware paradigm for collaborative model training. Specific to the example mentioned above, FL can greatly facilitate the scenario where many hospitals hope to build a joint COVID-19 diagnosis ML model from their distributed data. A real-life case has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, where FL has been successfully adopted to build a promising ML model for COVID-19 diagnosis, with the use of the geographically distributed chest CT (Computed Tomography) data collected from patients at different hospitals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, many recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have demonstrated that FL fails to provide sufficient privacy
guarantees, as sensitive information can be revealed in the training process. In FL, multiple clients send ML model weight or gradient updates derived from local training to a central server for global model training. The communication of model updates renders FL vulnerable to several recently developed privacy attacks, such as property inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and membership inference attacks (MIAs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Among these attacks, MIAs aim to identify whether or not a data record was in the training dataset the model was built on (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> a member). This can impose severe privacy risks on individuals. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, MIAs can infer that the owner of the clinical record has a high chance of having the disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, existing MIAs ignore the source of a training member, i.e., the information of which client owns the training member, while MIAs against FL models distinguish the training members of the model from the non-members. It is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond membership privacy, because the leakage of such information can lead to further privacy issues. For instance, in the scenario where multiple hospitals jointly train an FL model for COVID-19 diagnosis, MIAs can only reveal who have been tested for COVID-19, but the further identification of the source hospital where the people are from will make them more prone to discrimination, especially when the hospital is in a high risk region or country <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel inference attack called <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Source Inference Attack</span> (SIA) in the context of FL. SIA aims to determine which client owns a training record in FL. In practice, the SIA can be considered as a natural extension beyond MIAs, i.e., after determining which data instances are training members in MIAs, the adversary can further conduct the SIA to identify which client it comes from. To be practical, it is assumed that the adversary is an <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">honest-but-curious</span> central server, who knows the identities of clients and receives the updates from them. It is worth noting that the server can infer client-private information without interfering with the FL training nor affecting the model prediction performance. While the adversary can be one of the clients, we argue that it is impractical for her to launch SIAs as she knows little about other clients’ identities and can only access the joint models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we innovatively explore the SIA from the Bayesian perspective, and demonstrate that a server can achieve the optimal estimate of the source of a training member in an SIA without violating the FL protocol. To this end, the prediction loss of local models on the training members is utilised to obtain the source information of the training members effectively and non-intrusively. Besides theoretical formulation, we empirically evaluate the SIA in FL trained with one synthetic and five real world datasets, with respect to several FL aspects such as data distributions across clients, the number of clients, and the number of local epochs. The experiment results validate the efficacy of the proposed source inference attack under various FL settings. An important finding is that the success of an SIA is directly relevant to the generalizability of local models and the diversity of the local data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning allows multiple clients to jointly train an ML model in an interactive manner. It is an attractive framework for training ML models without direct access to diverse training data owned by different clients, especially for privacy-sensitive tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated averaging</span> (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> algorithm is the first and perhaps the most widely used FL algorithm. During multiple rounds of communication between server and clients, a central model is trained. At each communication round, the server distributes the current central model to local clients. The local clients then perform local optimization using their own data. To minimize communication, clients might update the local model for several epochs during a single communication round. Next, the optimized local models are sent back to the server, who average them to allocate a new central model. The performance of the new central model decides the training is either stopped or a new communication round starts. In FL, clients never share data, only their model weights or gradients.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Membership Inference Attacks</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Membership inference attacks aim to identify whether a data record was part of the target model’s training dataset or not. Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> present the first MIAs against ML models. Specifically, they demonstrate that an adversary can tell whether a data record has been used to train a classifier or not, solely based on the prediction vector of the data record. Since then, a growing body of work further investigates and explores the feasibility of MIAs on various ML models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have demonstrated the success of MIAs on FL models. For example, Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> have shown that an adversary can infer whether a specific location profile was used to train an FL model on the FourSquare location dataset with high success rate. Although MIAs can distinguish the training members of the FL model from the non-members, existing inference attacks ignore to further explore which client owns the training member identified by MIAs. In this paper, we fill this gap and show the possibilities of breaching the source privacy of training members.</p>

Now we use real datasets to further validate the effectiveness of SIAs and investigate the factors affecting the performance of SIAs. The SIAs leverages the local models’ different prediction loss on the training examples. Intuitively, if the local model is overfitted, it will perform much better on its training members than other data, i.e., distinguishable prediction loss between the local training data and other data.

However, when differential privacy can defend the SIA, it also hurts the performance of the model on its tasks, where the model utility drops from 71.2% to 12.3% on Location, and 68.3% to 10.0% on CIFAR-10. In this case, we can conclude that vanilla DP is not a effective solution for SIA in FL, which provides future research opportunities.</p>

The motivation is to share the model weights instead of the private data for better privacy protection.

MIAs in FL allows a malicious participant or server to distinguish the training members of the trained model from the non-members. Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> first explore MIAs in FL and demonstrate that an adversary can infer whether a specific location profile was used to train an FL model on FourSquare location dataset with 0.99 precision and perfect recall. Nasr et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> suggest an adversary can actively craft his updated model to extract more membership information about other clients. For training members of the FL model, the existing inference attacks fail to explore which client owns them. The source inference attacks proposed in this paper fill this gap.</p>

However, no protection approaches have been explored for SIAs. As discussed in the last section, applying differential privacy in FL is not an effective solution, since it suffers from the trade-off between model utility and defense performance of SIAs, providing future research opportunities.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new inference attack named source inference attack in the context of FL, which enables a malicious server to infer the source of a training example between clients. We derive an optimal attack strategy formally that the malicious server is able to gain non-trivial source information of the training members by evaluating the local model’s loss. We evaluate SIAs in FL with many real datasets and different settings. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SIAs in practice.</p>
