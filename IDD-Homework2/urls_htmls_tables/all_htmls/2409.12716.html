<p id="id25.id1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous vehicle navigation is a key challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring robust and accurate decision-making processes. This research introduces a new end-to-end method that exploits multimodal information from a single monocular camera to improve the steering predictions for self-driving cars. Unlike conventional models that
require several sensors which can be costly and complex or rely exclusively on RGB images that may not be robust enough under different conditions, our model significantly improves vehicle steering prediction performance from a single visual sensor.
By focusing on the fusion of RGB imagery with depth completion information or optical flow data, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates these modalities through both early and hybrid fusion techniques.</p>
<p id="id26.id2" class="ltx_p">We use three distinct neural network models to implement our approach: Convolution Neural Network - Neutral Circuit Policy (CNN-NCP) , Variational Auto Encoder - Long Short-Term Memory (VAE-LSTM) , and Neural Circuit Policy architecture VAE-NCP.
By incorporating optical flow into the decision-making process, our method significantly advances autonomous navigation. Empirical results from our comparative study using Boston driving data show that our model, which integrates image and motion information, is robust and reliable. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that do not use optical flow, reducing the steering estimation error by 31%. This demonstrates the potential of optical flow data, combined with advanced neural network architectures (a CNN-based structure for fusing data and a Recurrence-based network for inferring a command from latent space), to enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles steering estimation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-driving cars play a critical role in improving transportation by enhancing accessibility, efficiency and safety. These cars have intricate systems that enable them to perceive their environment and produce precise control movements, but they can sometimes take unsafe routes through conflict areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Reaching full autonomy requires expertise in multiple areas: perception, localization, planning, and control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
In this work, we focus on the steering estimation, a vital aspect of control that keeps vehicles within road bounds so that they can safely move around. Challenge arises with varying road conditions such as different road colors, textures, lighting and lane markings  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional methods of steering estimation use modular systems that deal with perception decision-making and control separately. However, these methods tend to be effective but have complex systems which need exact calibration as well as integration of different components possibly leading to mistakes as well as inefficiencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Recently end-to-end deep learning has emerged, where neural networks can be employed to learn vehicle steering directly from raw input data, such as images gathered by on-board cameras, offering a streamlined approach without needing a full vehicle model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Due to the effectiveness of such strategies in steering estimation, we use them in our work. Nonetheless, interpretability of such models has been one of the obstacles for the successful deployment in self-driving cars. An investigation into the interpretability and robustness of our method will be done using a new technique introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, conventional supervised end-to-end lateral control approaches have typically relied on RGB images as primary data sources, as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. While these frame-based approaches have typically solely relied on RGB images, the incorporation of multiple modalities, denoted as multimodal fusion, has emerged for addressing limitations of individual sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Despite extensive investigation into multimodal fusion, the predominant emphasis has been on integrating data from diverse sensors (RGB camera, Radar, Lidar) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, thereby neglecting the exploration of methods leveraging the abundance of visual data obtained from a single camera. Moreover, this process of integration from multiple sensors is computationally intensive and requires significant processing capability to help interpret data from many sensors in real time. This leads to higher power consumption which is a major concern for electric vehicles. Furthermore, sensor fusion systems must also address issues related to data synchronization, calibration, and the potential for conflicting information from different sensors, which can complicate the decision-making process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This study aims to explore the potential of deriving multiple modalities from a single camera and leveraging deep neural network techniques to fuse these modalities for enhanced prediction of vehicle steering angles.
The novelty of our work lies in enhancing steering estimation using modalities extracted from a single visual sensor and advanced networks like Neural Control Policy (NCP) network, which has demonstrated its efficiency in such applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Unlike NCP-based approaches that use solely RGB images, our approach employs this network with multiple modalities.

Model-based control strategies use a mathematical model of the vehicle dynamics, while model-free strategies use data-driven methods, both to generate appropriate control actions.
Because of the dynamic problem and complicated nature, we will focus on and employ a model-free approach, utilizing deep learning techniques explicitly to benefit from their data-driven learning abilities and flexibility when dealing with diverse situations without the requirement of set models.

In this way, they trained their model on lots of driving footage data sets which in turn made it possible for the model to accommodate variety of traffic conditions. Nevertheless, as far as more complex driving behaviors such as lane changes their scope was limited. Instead of using RGB images as input, Linda <em id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> exploited optical flow, the motion of objects between frames, to dynamically perceive the environment and generate a visual potential field whereby the direction and magnitude of flow vectors affects navigation decisions of the vehicle.

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other approaches focused on including time series instead of conventional CNNs. For instance,

The method was instrumental in enabling the system to have an enhanced knowledge of time context in driving conditions, making steering predictions to be more precise and stable over time. Similarly, Xu <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> created a model for driving by using fully convolutional network with LSTM for predicting steering angle.

LSTM and NCP provide robust steering estimation results, particularly under varying road illumination conditions, making them strong candidates for consideration in our work.

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To further enhance perception and decision-making capabilities, integrating multiple sensor modalities has been explored. Fusing RGB images with Lidar data, radar images and depth maps improved several perception tasks such as object recognition, tracking and semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Motivated by this, we present different studies that examine multimodality in end-to-end networks for steering estimation. There are several fusion methods, such as early fusion (concatenating raw data from different modalities into multiple input channels), late fusion (concatenating multimodal feature maps at the decision level), and hybrid fusion (fusing features at intermediate layers) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. High image calibration and synchronization are needed for early fusion, late fusion learns unimodal features independently but may lack cross-modal correlation, while hybrid fusion combines the strengths of both. Munir <em id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> addressed the challenge of predicting steering angles by integrating data from event-based cameras and frame-based RGB cameras.
The hybrid fusion of frame-based RGB data and event camera data was done through the use of self-attention layers between the convolutional encoders for each modality. This self-attention mechanism helps in learning long term relationships therefore, allowing the model to combine features from both sources before being passed to the decoder which predicts steering angle. Additionally, they showed that integrating event cameras leads to enhanced steering angle prediction.
Maanpää et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> used RGB images and Lidar range and reflectance data to forecast steering angles in challenging weather conditions. They adopted two fusion methodologies: the middle fusion dual model and the channel gated dual model. In the middle fusion strategy, features are fused after the convolutional phase of the network, whereas the channel gated dual model consists of two parallel architectures that integrate features through gated channels.
Abou-Hussein et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the efficacy of spatial, spatiotemporal, and multimodal approaches in predicting automotive steering.
Various strategies were tested, including a standard CNN, a 3D-CNN stacking three sequential grayscale images, spatial + difference method incorporating a difference frame between current and previous frames, and spatial with optical flow technique involving normalization of optical flow between current and previous frames.
Upon comparison with adopting of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), it was concluded that spatial + optical flow and spatial + difference variations outperformed simply stacking images in the 3D-CNN, emphasizing the advantage of explicitly incorporating temporal information into the model.

They evaluated early, mid, and late fusion methods for integrating multimodal data.
They showed that early fusion of multimodal data significantly enhances driving policy performance in diverse conditions.

They showed that the dense motion information provided by optical flow combined with accurate spatial measurements from laser enables the net to navigate complex and dynamic environments skillfully.
They compared their approach with traditional approaches that are either purely visual or LIDAR-based; hence demonstrating how a multmodal perception system benefits us.</p>

This dual temporal modeling allows our system to understand both immediate frame-to-frame changes and longer-term driving patterns, a crucial advancement for robust steering estimation.
This novel approach enables us to extract and utilize rich spatiotemporal information from a single camera source, a significant advancement over existing methods. By fusing RGB and optical flow data, we capture static scene geometry, local motion cues, and global temporal patterns, potentially improving the accuracy and robustness of steering estimation compared to unimodal approaches.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">4.1 </span>Dataset Description and Preparation</h3>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments utilize the dataset described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which comprises RGB images captured from a vehicle-mounted camera.
The dataset consists of sequences of RGB images along with corresponding steering angle labels, capturing a wide variety of road types, weather conditions, and traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for our task.
To focus on the most relevant parts of the scene for steering estimation, we apply preprocessing steps to each image. Following the procedure outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, each image is cropped to dimensions of 78 × 200 pixels, excluding pixels corresponding to the sky and the front view of the car, and concentrating on the road and immediate surroundings. Pixel values are then normalized to ensure consistent input scaling across different lighting conditions.
We employ a 10-fold cross-validation approach to ensure robust evaluation of our models. The dataset is divided into 10 folds, denoted as [F.1, F.2, …, F.10]. In each experimental run, one fold serves as the test dataset, while the remaining nine folds are used for training and validation. Within each training set, 10% of the images are reserved for validation, with the remaining 90% used for actual training. For example, when evaluating on fold F.1, 90% of [F.2, F.3, …, F.10] is used for training, 10% for validation, and F.1 serves as the test set.
For each preprocessed RGB image, we extract additional modalities as described in the Modality Extraction section. Depth maps are generated using both MiDaS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Monodepth2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> algorithms, while optical flow is computed between consecutive frames using the Farneback algorithm. These extracted modalities are aligned with their corresponding RGB images to create the multimodal input for our models.
This comprehensive dataset preparation process ensures that our models are trained and evaluated on a diverse and representative set of driving scenarios, allowing for a thorough assessment of our multimodal fusion approach to steering estimation. The use of multiple modalities derived from a single camera source enables us to explore the potential benefits of integrating spatial and temporal information for improved steering prediction accuracy.</p>

Interestingly, our experiments with depth modality (RGBD) did not yield improvements over RGB-only models. Therefore, we do not consider depth as an additional modality for the other models. However, early fusing optical flow with RGB (RGB-OF) enhances the model performance by incorporating motion-related data into the RGB color information, potentially offering valuable insights for vehicle steering estimation.
This improvement is evident when comparing the fifth line to the other lines in category (I), where the average MSE and MAE are reduced by 31%. Moreover, this enhancement is consistent across each fold, indicating consistent improvement.
The difference between the results obtained from adding depth and optical flow to the RGB images is likely due to the high correlation between RGB and depth information when extracted from a single camera source, as evidenced by the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) values presented in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The SSIM between RGB and depth maps (0.3 ± 0.12 for MiDaS and 0.26 ± 0.44 for Monodepth2) is significantly higher than that between RGB and optical flow (0.11 ± 0.036), indicating that optical flow provides more complementary information to RGB.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Encouraged by these results, we seek to further investigate this approach by applying it to two other models, VAE-NCP and VAE-LSTM. The results presented in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (II and III) show the significant decrease in MSE and MAE. Specifically, MSE is reduced by 68%, and MAE by more than 40% compared to using solely RGB images. This enhancement extends beyond steering estimation. As highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, VAE-NCP offers superior interpretability compared to CNN-NCP, albeit at the cost of decreased accuracy in terms of MSE (3.68; 5.68) when using only RGB images. However, with our proposed approach, both CNN-NCP and VAE-NCP methods achieve nearly identical improved MSE (1.64; 1.82), indicating that we have attained a model with enhanced interpretability while maintaining the accuracy level of improved CNN-NCP.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The superiority of the RGB-OF approach is further illustrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5.1 Results ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which shows the variation of MSE for training and validation across 100 steps. The RGB-OF models (green and blue lines) demonstrate consistently lower error rates compared to their RGB-only counterparts (black and red lines), particularly on the validation set. This suggests that the inclusion of optical flow not only improves overall performance but also enhances the model ability to generalize to unseen data.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To further analyze the robustness of the proposed approach, we employed the Automatic Latent Perturbation (ALP) tool proposed in<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This tool enhances the analysis of model robustness and interpretation of latent dimensions in VAEs, particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces. Traditional methods, which manually perturb latent variables to analyze changes in outputs, suffer from scalability issues and limited effectiveness in complex models. ALP automates this by perturbing each latent dimension and generating both positive and negative reconstructions, allowing for an assessment of the specific information each dimension encodes.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.7" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the ALP has been extended to evaluate the effects of latent dimension perturbations on operational outputs like steering commands in autonomous vehicles. This involves generating steering predictions by perturbing the latent vectors and passing them through a secondary model component, like the NCP in our case. By comparing the steering results from different perturbations, an impact score is computed, quantifying the influence of each latent dimension on steering behavior.

This figure provides insights into the variability and stability of the model predictions across different perturbed dimensions. Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Robustness Analysis using ALP ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> confirms, as previously mentioned, that integrating optical flow with RGB images enhances model predictions for steering control in unperturbed conditions, compared to using only RGB images. Furthermore, when analyzing the latent space perturbations, it is evident from Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Robustness Analysis using ALP ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that the model using both RGB and optical flow manifests significantly less variation in MSE across perturbed dimensions compared to the RGB-only model. This reduced variation in response to perturbations within the latent space highlights the model robustness; it shows more resilience to internal variability, which is crucial for dependable decision-making in dynamic environments. On the other hand, the higher variability across dimensions in the model based only on RGB images (see right plot in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Robustness Analysis using ALP ‣ 5 Results &amp; Discussion ‣ Optical Flow Matters: an Empirical Comparative Study on Fusing Monocular Extracted Modalities for Better Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) indicates less stable and reliable predictive behavior when the latent space is disturbed.</p>

We note a consistently higher impact score across the 32 perturbed dimensions for RGB-OF (left plot) in comparison to utilizing only RGB (right plot). This indicates that the RGB-OF model is potentially more adept at identifying when inputs or situations deviate from the norm, which could lead to better handling of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. The RGB model, with lower impact scores, might be less sensitive to these perturbations, potentially making it less effective at OOD detection. Consequently, the RGB-OF model can be considered more robust in this specific aspect of uncertainty identification and OOD situation handling. This increased sensitivity can be an asset in applications like autonomous driving systems, where recognizing OOD situations that differ from the training data is crucial for safety and performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study introduces a novel approach to enhance end-to-end steering estimation for autonomous vehicles by leveraging multimodal information extracted from a single monocular camera. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating the significant impact of incorporating optical flow information alongside RGB imagery. The fusion of RGB and optical flow data consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and other modality combinations, achieving a remarkable 31% reduction in steering estimation error. This improvement is consistent across various neural network architectures, including CNN-NCP, VAE-NCP, and VAE-LSTM, highlighting the robustness and versatility of our approach. Moreover, the integration of optical flow enhances the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data, as evidenced by lower error rates on validation sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These findings have important implications for the development of autonomous driving systems. By demonstrating that rich, multimodal information can be extracted and effectively utilized from a single camera source, our approach offers a cost-effective and computationally efficient solution for improving steering estimation accuracy. Future work could explore the integration of our approach with other sensor modalities and its application to other autonomous driving tasks. In conclusion, our research underscores the importance of leveraging complementary information sources in autonomous driving systems, potentially enhancing the safety and reliability of self-driving vehicles.
