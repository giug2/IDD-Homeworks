<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning has emerged to cope with raising concerns about privacy breaches in using Machine or Deep Learning models. This new paradigm allows the leverage of deep learning models in a distributed manner, enhancing privacy preservation. However, the server’s blindness to local datasets introduces its vulnerability to model poisoning attacks and data heterogeneity, tampering with the global model performance. Numerous works have proposed robust aggregation algorithms and defensive mechanisms, but the approaches are orthogonal to individual attacks or issues.
FedCC, the proposed method, provides robust aggregation by comparing the Centered Kernel Alignment of Penultimate Layers Representations.
The experiment results on FedCC demonstrate that it mitigates untargeted and targeted model poisoning or backdoor attacks while also being effective in non-Independently and Identically Distributed data environments. By applying FedCC against untargeted attacks, global model accuracy is recovered the most. Against targeted backdoor attacks, FedCC nullified attack confidence while preserving the test accuracy. Most of the experiment results outstand the baseline methods.

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread use of Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL) algorithm grows concerns about privacy breaches. Specifically, the development of DL led humans to enjoy technology (i.e., personalized recommendation, efficient and less error-prone computation, and more accurate forecast); however, it requires data to be transmitted and collected in a single location for training which introduces a single point to failure or the risk of data leakage. Along with such concern, stringent privacy rules, such as GDPR, mandate a higher degree of privacy preservation. Accordingly, the need for privacy-protecting mechanisms has risen, and Federated Learning (FL) has emerged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a distributed machine/deep learning framework. Each participating end device (client) trains a local model and sends the trained model parameters to a server for aggregation. In other words, data does not leave its origin; it is especially suitable for data-sensitive environments wanting to exploit the advantages of DL while preserving data privacy.
A vanilla FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> works by repeating the following steps. A server initializes a global model and advertises it to all clients. The server then randomly selects <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> clients. The selected clients train the model with their privately-owned data and then upload the model updates to the server. The server aggregates the model updates by averaging them. These steps are repeated until a stopping criterion is met. The fact that the clients only keep their training data locally, instead of transmitting them to a single location, functions as a beneficial factor for data privacy by reducing the attack surface (i.e., a chance of data leakage on the server or in-between communication).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, by its distributed nature, FL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. The server’s inaccessibility to local datasets makes it impossible to examine data quality, validate model parameters, and guarantee that the data are Independently and Identically Distributed (IID). Compromised clients or attackers exploit the vulnerability to craft the local model parameters before they send them to the server for aggregation. They aim to indiscriminately hamper the global model performance (untargeted) or make wrong predictions on an attacker-chosen class of inputs (targeted). Targeted model poisoning attacks that maintain their performance on unchosen classes are called backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are known to be stealthier and more difficult to detect because the attacker only misclassifies a specific class of inputs as a chosen label while leaving the performance on unchosen ones as usual.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In line with this, a number of robust aggregation methods and defensive mechanisms against model or data poisoning attacks have been proposed. Some preliminary works allow a server to have a portion of raw data to teach it what benign features look like; some allow data sharing between clients to give the server knowledge about how data are distributed and what is normal. Nevertheless, if FL is used with shared data, the peculiar advantages of FL would be significantly diminished and endangering raw data exposure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, previous works mitigating targeted or untargeted model poisoning attacks are primarily in an IID data environment. Nonetheless, data are more likely to be non-IID in practice; previous methods may not work as expected in practical settings. Non-IID data, also known as heterogeneous data, entails a different number of data samples for each class, distinct classes of data for each client, different features but with the same label, or the same feature but with different labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Due to its unidentical distribution, the participation of clients having heavily non-IID datasets may gradually deteriorate the global model performance as the learning process continues. Nonetheless, even for a server with robust aggregation algorithms, it is difficult to detect and remove malicious clients reliably because the degree of non-IID is directly proportional to the effect of attacks. Thus, the server may mistakenly exclude benign clients from aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, we develop FedCC that provides robust aggregation under untargeted model poisoning and targeted backdoor attacks while considering the non-IID data environment. FedCC disallows any raw data or additional information sharing between a server and other clients so as to maximize the advantages given by FL. FedCC compares each model’s Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) of Penultimate Layer Representations (PLRs) to identify malicious clients over benign ones. FedCC enhances global accuracy against untargeted model poisoning attacks and decreases attack confidence against targeted backdoor attacks while preserving benign accuracy compared to the baseline methods.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks due to its distributed nature and the server’s inability to directly examine the dataset quality and model parameter integrity. Poisoning attacks are categorized into data and model poisoning attacks based on what the adversaries manipulate. However, model poisoning attacks are more effective and destructive as the malicious client’s parameters are stealthily tuned to maximize the damage to the overall performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, we focus on model poisoning attacks in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Model poisoning attacks allow client-side adversaries to alter the local model parameters directly before sending them to the server. To avoid divergence from the global model, the attackers optimize the local model for both training loss and an adversarial objective, improving its stealthiness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The adversarial clients can additionally manipulate the model hyperparameter, such as the learning rate, number of local epochs, batch size, and optimization objective, to manipulate the training rules before and during the local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the attacker’s goals, model poisoning attacks are subdivided into untargeted and targeted model poisoning attacks. Untargeted model poisoning attacks diminish global test accuracy, while targeted model poisoning attacks aim to mislead the model to classify a specific class of inputs. In this paper, we added a backdoor ability to the targeted model poisoning attacks, meaning that the inputs of chosen class are misclassified to the chosen label, at the same time, the performance of the rest is not impacted, making the attack stealthier and thus more challenging to detect.</p>

Inspired by that the sybils’ crafted model parameters direct toward a more similar direction to each other than between the benign ones, FoolsGold measured cosine similarity between each local model’s gradients and marked the most similar ones as sybils. However, their method is specifically designed for handling targeted poisoning attacks from a group of clone-based sybils, not an individual malicious client. Thus, it is limited in that it cannot filter a single malicious client because there is no other malicious one to compare the angle to. Also, their experimental result shows that it is only effective in a highly non-IID dataset.</p>

The trust score is a ReLU clipped cosine similarity retrieved by applying ReLU clipping on the cosine similarities between each local model and the global model’s parameters. The ReLU clipping step converts the trust score to zero for clients with negative values and ultimately excludes them. Nevertheless, their method is limited in two ways: weight scaling could prevent a model from convergence, and the clients share a small portion of the innocent dataset with a server, risking raw data exposure.</p>

Since highly non-IID data distributions look different from each other, they often fail to distinguish between benign clients having non-IID data and malicious clients; benign clients with non-IID data are often classified as malicious. In contrast, we used a kernel-based metric (i.e., CKA) to measure the similarity between global and local models, reliably identifying correlations between differently trained models.</p>

Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> discovered that PLRs demonstrate the extraordinary capability to distinguish malicious models from benign ones; benign PLRs follow the same distribution, while malicious PLRs follow a different one across multiple datasets and neural network architectures. Specifically, they demonstrated that PLR distances among benign models are smaller than those of benign and malicious models. Their proposed method, FLARE, assigns a trust score to each client based on pairwise PLR discrepancies defined by Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) among all model updates, allocating lower values to those farther from the benign distribution. The model updates are then scaled and averaged, weighted by each client’s trust score. However, FLARE is limited in that the server has a subset of raw data, continuously redirecting the global model but might jeopardize data privacy in case the server is compromised.</p>

It compares representations between layers and between differently initialized or trained models. In other words, it would be an effective metric to compare the models trained on highly non-IID data.

Indeed, our preliminary experiments with other similarity metrics, like cosine similarity or the similarity based on Euclidean distances, have failed to distinguish clients having non-IID data from malicious clients. We suppose it is because non-IID clients seem like an outlier among IID clients and the stealthiness of malicious clients. However, with CKA, the similarity is higher between the benign clients, either IID or non-IID, than between the benign and malicious clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We assume two types of attacks: untargeted model poisoning attacks and targeted backdoor attacks. Both attacks involve client-side attackers that manipulate the model parameters before sending them to the server for aggregation. Untargeted attacks in this paper follow the attacks in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> (Fang attacks) that aim to degrade the global model accuracy on all classes indiscriminately. Fang attacks are designed to evade robust aggregation rules: Krum and Coordinate-wise Median/Trimmed Mean. A targeted backdoor attack follows <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that misleads a global model to misclassify the data sample of an attacker-chosen class to another attacker-chosen label while maintaining the accuracy of unchosen classes.</p>

The attacks specifically aim to break Krum and Coordinate-wise Median (Coomed) aggregation rules. The aim of the attack is to interrupt the model training so as to drop global test accuracy. The attacks include flipping the sign of the malicious parameters so the parameters direct towards the inverse direction along which the global model parameter should change without attacks. We will refer the attack against Krum to <span id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Untargeted-Krum</span> and the latter to <span id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Untargeted-Med</span> from here.

The malicious client owns one sample of mislabeled images and trains the local model on it. We train the model on backdoor tasks along with the main task; the training went on for both malicious and benign tasks to maintain benign accuracy. Then we boosted malicious clients’ updates to negate the combined effect of the benign agent:</p>

We chose to compare only PLRs (i.e., not all layers) because it is the most differentiable layer among differently trained models. Also, we chose to use RBF CKA because the similarity differences between non-IID clients are smaller than the non-IID and malicious clients. The similarity values are further clustered using a simple K-means clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is two: benign and malicious (line 11). Any clustering method can be used as long as it can produce only two clusters.</p>

Because weight scaling could prevent the model from convergence even when it reaches optima, we do not scale any weights whether they are classified as benign.

As mentioned above, the server cannot access local datasets; it instead receives the trained model parameters (weight in this case) of selected clients. Thus, the only way to determine whether a client has malicious intent is to analyze the weights it received. The output of the last layer before the softmax layer takes the end result of the convolution and pooling process and reaches a classification decision. In other words, computed weights of the second last layer contain the essential and indicative information that affects the classification result the most.</p>

Each line refers to the cluster distances under attack in IID or non-IID settings; for example, the line ’mkrum_iid’ illustrates the cluster distance under the untargeted-mKrum attack in an IID setting. Observably, the cluster distance is the largest in PLR among all layers; it means that the degree of differences is the maximum with PLRs. We thus decided to use the weights of the penultimate layer of local models, which contains the most characteristic, refined, and rich-enough information among any other layers, to compare its similarity to the global model.

Centered Kernel Alignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, or CKA, is a similarity metric to measure how similar or different two neural networks are from each other. It compares representations between layers or differently trained models. It creates similarity kernel matrices in the individual space and compares the similarity matrices to characterize the representation space. It has multiple outstanding abilities; it can learn similarities between layers of different widths, random initialization, invertible linear transformations, orthogonal transformations, and isotropic scaling. In other words, given two trained networks with the same architecture but different initialization, layers at the same depth should be most similar to each other.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><a href="#S6.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 6.1.1 Untargeted Model Poisoning Attacks ‣ 6.1 Non-IID Data Environment ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table V</span></a> shows the test accuracy of the global model on three datasets (fMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100) under Untargeted-Krum and Untargeted-Med in a non-IID environment.
Interestingly, the robust aggregation algorithms often result in lower accuracy than when the server only takes an average (i.e., FedAvg). This is because of inaccurate filtering of malicious clients; for example, indeed malicious clients are wrongly marked as benign, so their weights are aggregated. In the upper section (i.e., Untargeted-Krum), we can observe that the accuracy has dropped by a large margin when applying Krum and Bulyan. This is obvious as Untargeted-Krum is explicitly designed to degrade the accuracy when Krum is applied. Coomed cannot effectively mitigate this attack because median values of the weights often fail to represent benign clients, especially in non-IID settings. We also presume the relatively low accuracy of FLARE is because it scales weights even when the model is already showing good performance. Instead, FedCC selectively averages weights, neither boosting nor minimizing. FedCC significantly outperforms the other methods in the experiments with CIFAR100. Some methods like Coomed and FLARE result in better test accuracy meaning somewhat mitigation against the attack; however, as shown, the accuracy is almost twice higher with FedCC. FedCC shows the highest accuracy (66.27% for fMNSIT, 37.40% for CIFAR10, and 14.51% for CIFAR100).</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The lower section (i.e., Untargeted-Med) is a different story. The accuracy of FedAvg dropped by a large margin because this attack makes the median values deviate from the direction if there is no attack, making outliers. It also explains the relatively high accuracy when Coomed and Bulyan are applied – coordinate-wise median and trimmed mean ignore the outliers. However, FLARE shows a similar trend to the above attack due to the weight scaling. Commonly for both attacks, we can observe that Krum is less robust than Coomed, and Bulyan is less robust than Coomed. It is because Krum picks one local model as the global model, but Coomed aggregates multiple local models to update the global model. Also, Bulyan takes averages of multiple chosen clients, thus having more probability of the malicious model being selected, especially when the benign clients have non-IID data.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FedCC outperforms the other methods showing the highest accuracy (72.76%, 42.37%, and 16.12%, for fMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, respectively), even though it does not share any raw data with the server or the other clients. We assume FedCC mitigates both attacks the best because 1) PLRs have the essence of refined information, and 2) the CKA similarity is high for those between the benign clients having non-IID data shard than between the benign and malicious clients.</p>

The trends seem similar to that of non-IID experiments, but the test accuracy values are a bit higher as the clients have IID data. In the upper section of the table (i.e., Untargeted Krum), Krum and Bulyan result in relatively low accuracy because the attack explicitly targets to interrupt Krum and its variety. When applying Coomed, the accuracy is increased by a large margin because the median values can represent benign clients when every client has an evenly distributed data shard. FLARE could not continuously guarantee well-recovered accuracy because weight scaling constantly changes the weight even if the model is optimized to the minimum. Since FedCC does not scale weights, the model is solely optimized to the minimum by averaging the selected clients. It thus results in the highest accuracy (89.23% for fMNIST, 67.12% for CIFAR10, and 14.51% for CIFAR100).</p>

Notably, Krum, Coomed, and Bulyan have similar values of accuracy, indicating that the coordinate-wise median values are close to the value least deviating from the weights of the global model. Meanwhile, FedCC shows the highest test accuracy, as 88.44% for fMNIST, 64.74% for CIFAR10, and 17.83% for CIFAR100.</p>

Nine benign clients and one malicious client participate in the training process, and all their weights are sent to the server for aggregation. Since targeted backdoor attacks stealthily train the global model to misclassify an attacker-chosen class to an attacker-chosen label while the remaining classes are classified normally, test accuracy has not been significantly dropped for all datasets. However, we can observe that the confidence, the likelihood of being misclassified, has been reduced to almost zero with FedCC, invalidating the backdoor task. The confidence of attack of FedCC is much lower than those of FedAvg and Bulyan, which showed better test accuracy for the CIFAR10 dataset. Maintaining the test accuracy is important, but if the defense method cannot considerably reduce the attack confidence, it is difficult to say that the attack is effectively mitigated.
Thus, we could conclude that our proposed method does reach the highest test accuracy on the fMNIST and CIFAR100 datasets and comparable accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset while nullifying the backdoor confidence for all datasets.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We examine the effect of different numbers of malicious clients under untargeted attacks (Untargeted-Krum and Untargeted-Med). We fixed the number of total clients and participation fraction for this set of experiments as 10 and 1, respectively. To follow the assumption that the number of attackers is less than half of the participating clients, we examine the test accuracy where at most four malicious clients are involved. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 6.3.1 Impact of the Number of Malicious Clients ‣ 6.3 Performance in Varying FL Settings ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 6</span></a> illustrates the test accuracy of the given experimental setting. FedCC outperforms the other defensive method except for one case, where two attackers launch an Untargeted-Med attack on the fMNIST dataset. We observe that the test accuracy with defense methods gets lower as the number of attackers is greater. Besides FedAvg, we can observe Coomed has dropped by the largest margin between when there is one malicious client and four malicious clients. This is because the greater the malicious client participation, the greater the probability of the median values being closer to malicious. FedCC, on the other hand, does not depend on angle or distance but identifies hidden correlations between different networks, thus more accurate in filtering malicious clients regardless of the number of malicious clients. We can still observe the accuracy degradation as the number of malicious clients gets greater; however, it is the result of fewer clients being aggregated, not because of malicious clients being selected.</p>

In other words, we set the numbers of malicious clients to 3, 2, and 1, where the numbers of clients being aggregated are 10, 6, and 4, respectively.

The accuracy goes down as the total number of clients gets smaller. This is because of the data heterogeneity. The weights of only four clients are aggregated when there are 40 clients in total, meaning the learned global model is trained on less diverse data or biased. Nonetheless, FedCC achieves the highest accuracy in almost every case. It indicates that the similarity comparison method (i.e., CKA) correctly filters the malicious clients, even if the clients have non-IID data shards, without sharing any data or knowledge with the server.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we examine the impact of the participating fraction of clients where the number of total clients is fixed. The participating fractions of clients are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, such that the numbers of clients being aggregated are 10, 30, and 50, respectively. The proportion of malicious clients is fixed at 0.3, such that the malicious clients are 3, 9, and 15, respectively. The test accuracy under untargeted attacks is summarized in <a href="#S6.T10" title="TABLE X ‣ 6.3.3 Impact of Fraction ‣ 6.3 Performance in Varying FL Settings ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table X</span></a>. We can observe that the test accuracy tends to increase as the participation fraction is greater under untargeted-Krum attacks. It implies that the more client participation in a non-IID setting, the more accurate the global model is produced if the attacks are effectively mitigated. Under untargeted-Med attacks, the test accuracy is the highest with FedCC and second highest with Coomed. These indicate that selectively choosing clients based on CKA similarity is more reliable than taking the median value of each coordinate in a non-IID setting.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Throughout the experiment, the global model trained with FLARE did not converge, and the test accuracy fluctuated. The fluctuation is due to the weight scaling while randomly selecting clients. Unlike previous experiments, the server chooses a fraction of the client every round, meaning not-yet-trained models can be selected. In this environment, weight scaling leveraged by FLARE constantly improperly scale the local weights, causing divergence and fluctuation.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the prevalent use of machine/deep learning and raising concerns about privacy breaches, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged. FL, however, is known for its vulnerability to model poisoning attacks due to its blindness to local datasets, making it impossible to guarantee IID data distribution. In line with this, a number of robust aggregation algorithms and defensive mechanisms have been proposed, but the approaches are orthogonal to various attacks, as well as lack consideration of non-IIDness. The proposed method does consider both untargeted and targeted (or backdoor) attacks simultaneously while demonstrating its effectiveness in non-IID data environments.</p>
