<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized learning framework through which multiple clients can collaboratively train a learning model. However, a major obstacle that impedes the wide deployment of FL lies in massive communication traffic. To train high dimensional machine learning models (such as CNN models), heavy communication traffic can be incurred by exchanging model updates via the Internet between clients and the parameter server (PS), implying that the network resource can be easily exhausted. Compressing model updates is an effective way to reduce the traffic amount. However, a flexible unbiased compression algorithm applicable for both uplink and downlink compression in FL is still absent from existing works.
In this work, we devise the Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC) algorithm to compress model updates transmitted between clients and the PS. In MUCSC, it is only necessary to transmit cluster centroids and the cluster ID of each model update. Moreover, we prove that: 1) The compressed model updates are unbiased estimation of their original values so that the convergence rate by transmitting compressed model updates is unchanged; 2) MUCSC can guarantee that the influence of the compression error on the model accuracy is minimized.
Then, we further propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm, a biased compression algorithm that can achieve an extremely high compression rate by grouping insignificant model updates into a super cluster. B-MUCSC is suitable for scenarios with very scarce network resource. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experiments with the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets to demonstrate that our algorithms can not only substantially reduce the volume of communication traffic in FL, but also improve the training efficiency in practical networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, terminal devices generate a large amount of data through interacting with the environment which can help us train more advanced machine learning models.However, it is unrealistic to collect all these data to centrally train machine learning models due to the limitation of network capacity and the concern of privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train models without intruding user privacy, Federated Learning (FL) is firstly devised by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and then thrives quickly. Through FL, decentralized clients only interchange model updates with the parameter server (PS) via the Internet to complete a training task so that the original data samples can be maintained locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Due to this fantastic feature, FL is specially applicable for IoT and edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, a major obstacle that impedes the deployment of FL in real world lies in the massive communication traffic transmitted between clients and the PS.
In a typical FL system, there may reside thousands of clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> who need to exchange model updates with the PS for multiple rounds of aggregations (a.k.a. global iterations). However, the network speed, especially the uplink speed, is much slower than the CPU speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, the model dimension could be in the magnitude of millions for complicated neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Thus, it implies that network resource can be easily exhausted by training high dimensional models in FL. For instance, each client can generate 4MB uplink traffic per global iteration if the model dimension is one million and the size of each model update is 4 bytes. If there are 1,000 clients to communicate with the PS for 100 rounds, the total uplink traffic will be 400GB. The huge traffic volume can saturate the network capacity and choke the PS, and the training time can be prolonged substantially. For many real-time applications, such an inefficient training process is unacceptable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A number of previous works have been dedicated to compressing model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in FL. These works can be summarized as two kinds. The first kind devised unbiased algorithms which approximate model updates with unbiased estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, the second kind designed biased compressing algorithms which are more flexible and can achieve much higher compression rates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.

However, a common challenge confronted by the above compression algorithms is that the distribution of model updates is different in every global iteration. It implies that compression algorithms should be adjusted effectively in accordance with the distribution of model updates in each global iteration, which has not been well solved by existing works.
It is also worth to mention compression algorithms designed for distributed machine learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Although, it is possible to apply these algorithms in FL, there is no guarantee for the compression performance and model accuracy in that the sample distribution in FL is non-iid different from that in distributed learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In addition, the convergence property of iterative algorithms in FL such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is different from that in distributed learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel compression algorithm to reduce the communication volume in FL without compromising the model accuracy, which is named as Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC).
 MUCSC can compress both uplink and downlink model updates. It can achieve a very high compression rate, and meanwhile guarantee the convergence of trained machine learning models. 
Specifically, in a round of global iteration, each participating client groups model updates to be transmitted into a small number of clusters. Cluster centroids are determined adaptively through minimizing a specially designed compression error function. Then, each client only needs to upload the centroid value of each cluster and the cluster ID of each model update to the PS.
In a similar way, the PS compresses aggregated model updates by grouping all aggregated model updates into a small number of clusters before it distributes the aggregated model updates to all clients.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We theoretically prove that the compressed model updates are unbiased estimation of their original values. By leveraging the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, we further prove that the MUCSC algorithm can achieve the same convergence rate as that without compression. The specially designed compression objective function can minimize the influence of the compression error on the model accuracy.
To further boost MUCSC, we propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm that groups insignificant model updates with values close to 0 as a super cluster. With this boost, the compression rate can be further improved by more than 10 times.</p>

The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> developed probabilistic quantization algorithms and explained the mean square error introduced by these algorithms.

The EM algorithm first computes the gradients based on the given centroid; then updates centroids and the sets of model updates division based on the gradient computed in the previous step, and then iterates repeatedly until a certain number of iterations. The steady ascending steps of the EM algorithm can find the optimal centroid very reliably.

We argue that this synchronization is necessary without incurring much communication overhead in FL. Firstly, FL is an open platform and clients can depart the system at any time. Synchronization can make clients have the latest models at any time when they depart the system. Secondly, the downlink capacity is usually much larger than uplink capacity for modern Internet such that the broadcasting of aggregated model updates is very efficient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Lastly, the MUCSC algorithm can reduce the volume of the downlink traffic significantly, which will not consume much network resource.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Although MUCSC incurs compression errors, the intuition that MUCSC will not lower the converge rate can be explained as below. MUCSC conducts unbiased estimation of original parameters, and the estimation error can be strictly bounded. With the decrease of the learning rate, the influence of the estimation error also diminishes, and hence the FL training converges. Similar to the role of the variance of the stochastic gradients in each client in Assumption <a href="#Thmassumption2" title="Assumption 2. ‣ V-A Assumptions ‣ V Convergence Rate Analysis ‣ Slashing Communication Traffic in Federated Learning by Transmitting Clustered Model Updates" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the compression error only increases the variance of learned parameters, and will not lower the convergence rate.</p>

To further improve the compression rate without compromising model accuracy significantly, we propose the Boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) by incorporating the Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) algorithm into MUCSC. DGC is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> based on the fact that the values of the most model updates are close to 0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Thus, the trained model can be effectively updated by only accurately uploading a very small fraction (<em id="S5.SS5.p1.6.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, 1%) of model updates which are far away from 0.</p>

MUCSC is particularly applicable if the computation capacity (of the PS and clients) is excessive but the communication capacity is limited. However, it is very difficult to theoretically incorporate the restrictions of computation and communication capacity into our convergence rate analysis.

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS3.p3.5" class="ltx_p">In each round of global iteration, 10 clients are randomly selected to upload their model updates for model aggregation at the PS. The network is setup according to the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, in which there is a single PS co-located with a bases station. Clients are evenly distributed around the PS in a circle of 2km. The model updates are transmitted between the PS and each client via wireless communication channels with the carrier frequency 2.5GHz. The antenna lengths of the base station and each client are 11m and 1m, respectively. We set the transmission power and antenna gain of the PS and each client as 20dBm and 0dBi, respectively. The average communication speed is set as 1.4 Mb/s for uplink and downlink. However, the actual communication speed between the PS and each client is a random variable sampled from the Gaussian distribution at the beginning of each global iteration.

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Among these baselines, only QSGD is an unbiased compression algorithm. All others are biased compression algorithms. Usually, biased algorithms can achieve higher compression rates with the cost of lower model accuracy.
According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, there is another way to classify compression algorithms. The algorithms that only upload a small fraction of (compressed) model updates to the PS in each global iteration are regarded as the sparsification algorithms. The algorithms that quantify model updates into a small number of bits with error compensation are regarded as quantization algorithms. MUCSC, SSGD and QSGD are quantization algorithms, while B-MUCSC, STC and DGC are sparsification algorithms.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The total communication traffic is defined as the multiplication of communication rounds (<em id="S6.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, the number of global iterations) and the volume of the communication traffic of each global iteration. By leveraging this metric, we can evaluate the performance of each compression algorithm by setting a fixed model accuracy. In practice, this evaluation is more meaningful if the target of the model training is to obtain a model with at least certain accuracy.
Thus, we suppose that there is a predefined threshold as the target of model training. The training process will not terminate before the model accuracy exceeds the threshold. With this setting, the numbers of conducted iterations are different if different compression algorithms are adopted.

Then, we compare the number of global iterations and the total communication traffic volume of each algorithm.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Reducing the communication cost is an effective approach to accelerate the convergence of FL. In this work, we design a novel algorithm MUCSC by compressing both uplink and downlink high dimensional model updates into a few centroid values through a soft clustering algorithm. The amount of communication traffic between individual clients and PS can be significantly reduced since only centroid values and centroid IDs are exchanged via the Internet. Meanwhile, MUCSC can guarantee that the trained model will converge with the same rate as that without compression. Our study also reveals the tradeoff between the compression rate and the model accuracy. A boosted MUCSC is devised by hiding IDs of parameters whose model updates are close to 0. In the end, extensive experiments with the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets are carried out to verify our analysis and demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our compression algorithms.</p>
