<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, machine learning algorithms continue to grow in complexity and require a substantial amount of computational resources and energy. For these reasons, there is a growing awareness of the development of new green algorithms and distributed AI can contribute to this.
Federated learning (FL) is one of the most active research lines in machine learning, as it allows the training of collaborative models in a distributed way, an interesting option in many real-world environments, such as the Internet of Things, allowing the use of these models in edge computing devices. In this work, we present a FL method, based on a neural network without hidden layers, capable of generating a global collaborative model in a single training round, unlike traditional FL methods that require multiple rounds for convergence. This allows obtaining an effective and efficient model that simplifies the management of the training process. Moreover, this method preserve data privacy by design, a crucial aspect in current data protection regulations.
We conducted experiments with large datasets and a large number of federated clients. Despite being based on a network model without hidden layers, it maintains in all cases competitive accuracy results compared to more complex state-of-the-art machine learning models. Furthermore, we show that the method performs equally well in both identically and non-identically distributed scenarios. Finally, it is an environmentally friendly algorithm as it allows significant energy savings during the training process compared to its centralized counterpart.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are all conscious of the enormous potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and their impact in our daily lives. However, it comes together with increases of energy and resource footprint, resulting in clear environmental costs. Machine learning algorithms keep growing in complexity, and many state-of-the-art methods continue to emerge, each requiring a substantial amount of computational resources and energy. On one hand, training and adjustment are energy-consuming processes that can last thousands of hours on specialized hardware accelerators and, by themselves, can produce a high carbon footprint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>; on the other hand, very often they depend on the use of data centers that are extremely energy consuming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This problem is much more pronounced in recent years when training data and the power of AI models have grown exponentially. As an example, the amount of training data on Facebook for use of recommendations has increased by 2.4 in the last two years, reaching the scale of exabytes and, in OpenAI, the compute used in
various large AI training models had been
doubling every 3.4 months since 2012 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This is what has been called Red AI. For these reasons, there is an increasing awareness among the various actors (researchers, governments, industry, etc.) of the importance of developing technological solutions that make an efficient use of energy and other resources, thereby promoting long-term technological sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of AI on our planet. These are the goals of what has been called Green AI. This field is attracting more attention and it can be considered as a hot research topic<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>As examples, it is a core topic within the European Green Deal Strategy and countries like Spain already have the development of “green algorithms” as a priority in its National AI Strategy.</span></span></span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, there are advances that contribute to avoiding high consumption processes in the training of ML models. Among them, we can mention distributed AI, a computing paradigm that bypasses the need to move huge amounts of data and provides the ability to analyze data at the source (edge devices). While most data processing is still taking place at centralized data centers, organizations are discovering the benefits of edge computing. It was predicted that by 2025, 75 percent of data will be created and processed outside a traditional cloud or data center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as a result of the use of mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) or machine-generated data, leading to a rethink about where computing should take place. Therefore, decentralized alternatives to data center based on machine learning are emerging. One of the most prominent is Federated Learning (FL).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a machine learning environment in which many clients collaboratively train a model, usually under the control of a central coordinator, keeping the training data decentralized. This paradigm presents several advantages compared to traditional and centralized machine learning among them, (a) highly efficient use of network bandwidth, less information is transmitted; (b) low latency, real time decisions can be made locally at the different clients and (c) privacy, under the assumption that the clients and servers are non malicious, privacy enhances and the probability of threats reduces to a certain extent. The term federated learning was introduced in 2017 by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> when the authors proposed to solve a learning task by a loose federation of participating devices (clients) that are coordinated by a central server. The underlying idea of training models without collecting raw training data in a single location has proven to be useful in a wide range of practical scenarios. While FL is still not a fully mature technology, it is already being used by millions of users on a daily basis. The algorithm proposed by McMahan et al. has been applied to Google’s Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to improve next word prediction models and several studies have explored the use of federated learning in scenarios that deal with privacy sensitive data such as health diagnosis, collaboration across multiple hospitals or government agencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a green federated learning method that is privacy-preserving by design. Unlike most FL methods, it allows to obtain the global model in a non-iterative way in a single round of consultation with the clients, thus reducing both training time and communication needs. In addition, in the event of a client connection failure, client’s data can be quickly and easily incorporated into the global model as soon as it becomes available and, as will be shown, it works correctly whether or not the data is identically distributed among the clients. All this makes it an very interesting environmentally friendly algorithm that saves energy during the training process compared to its centralized counterpart. Reducing the energy consumption of FL techniques will have important benefits, such as reducing the operating costs when training models, increasing battery lifetimes of the devices using those models, and also lowering the temperature of chips and other components, thus making faster running times possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, the potential environmental impact of these algorithms is not being addressed in depth by the scientific community. Whilst the carbon footprint for centralized learning has been studied in many previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, in case of FL environment it remains little explored. There are only few works that deal with this topic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Savazzi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose a novel framework for the analysis of energy and carbon footprints in distributed and federated learning. The proposed framework quantifies both the energy footprints and the carbon equivalent emissions for methods and consensus-based fully decentralized approaches. Inspired by this work, in this paper, we will use measurements to show the electrical consumption of the proposed model. Specifically, instead of using measures of carbon emissions, which are dependent on the electric power generation systems employed in each country, in this research we will use consumption measures in watt hours, since it is a more general measure.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the federated learning environment, models are trained in a distributed scenario, either across a large number of clients with low computational abilities, such as personal devices, or across a relatively small number of very reliable clients, typically organizations such as medical or financial institutions. The first setting is known as cross-device while the second one is known as cross-silo. In any case, FL training is usually conducted in several rounds of communication, in each of which a fraction of the clients are selected to participate in the learning process. These clients receive the current global model from the coordinator and perform local training with their local data before sending the updated models back to the central server. Finally, the server aggregates these updated models, resulting in a new global model. This process is repeated for a fixed number of rounds.
There exists several aggregation strategies, the most widely used is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In this approach, the central server aggregates the model by performing a weighted sum of the received parameters based on the number of samples in each local dataset. FedAvg has probed its success but, it has been shown that its performance degrades significantly on heterogeneous data. FedAvg reduces the frequency of communication required performing multiple updates on the local clients, but this fact can lead to overfitting to local data. This phenomenon is called <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-drift</span> and can lead to slower convergence.
To solve this problem, Karimireddy et al. present a solution named SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. SCAFFOLD uses a mechanism to correct the <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-drift</span> in its local updates, requiring significantly fewer communication rounds and not being so affected by the heterogeneity of the data. But its main drawback is that it is designed for what is called a cross-silo setting, in which only a relatively small number of reliable clients participate usually
with large computational ability (e.g. institutions). To solve it, a new solution MIME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> was presented for the cross-device federated learning setting, where the number of clients may be extreme, they may have limited computing resources (e.g. mobiles) and the communication network may be unreliable. MIME is a framework that adapts centralized algorithms to the federated setting. It overcomes the natural client-heterogeneity in such a setting and reduces communication by naively reducing the number of participating clients per round. MIME uses a combination of control variates and server-level optimizer state (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each local update mimics that of the centralized method run on IID data. Although it has been shown to consistently outperform FedAvg, and largely mitigate the <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-drift</span> problem, it still exhibits some performance perturbations compared to the centralized base algorithm.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, regarding energy consumption, Alfauri el al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> propose an Energy-efficient Consensus Protocol (EECP) for sustainable federated learning. The goal of their protocol is to jointly optimize computation and transmissions by selecting at each round which clients will participate, while the total energy consumption is minimized. Although this protocol is applicable in almost any federated learning scheme, the method is not concerned with energy-optimizing the specific learning algorithm used at each client.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a federated method is described that includes strong security measures to prevent privacy breaches by using homomorphic encryption for client-to-client communications. However, under conditions where communications can be assumed to be secure and clients are not malicious, dispensing with this encryption process would yield a more energy efficient method while still achieving minimal privacy by design.</p>

The distributed option generates a lower consumption initially, but there may come a time when the number of devices is so large that it demands more energy than the centralized option. Despite this, in the experiments conducted, in the smallest set (SUSY) the number of devices supported without exceeding the consumption of the centralized option is around 4000, while for the largest set (Higgsx4), the demand generated by the 20,000 devices used is well below the demand of the centralized version of the algorithm.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have presented a novel federated machine learning method, based on one-layer neural networks. It has been shown that for large datasets the proposed method is a very efficient federated proposal that also allows a significant reduction in energy consumption, and as a consequence in carbon emissions, compared to its centralized counterpart. This makes it an algorithm very much in line with green artificial intelligence and well suited for use in learning on edge environments where training processes generally cannot consume large resources. In addition, it also has some other advantages compared to current federated learning methods:</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<ul id="S5.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S5.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S5.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to obtain the optimal weights of the network, only a single round of training is necessary, involving all the devices. The vast majority of current methods in the literature use multiple rounds of training in which part of the clients collaborate. This allows for a faster and more robust learning process against attacks that attempt to violate data privacy, by having to share less information over the communication network.</p>

<p id="S5.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is privacy preserving by design, as no raw data is transmitted nor can be recovery from the interchanged data.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S5.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It has been shown that the method obtains equivalent solutions whether the environment is IID or non-IID. This is an important advantage since most federated learning models do not have exactly the same solution and performance in IID environments as in non-IID ones. Moreover, its accuracy is similar to the one obtained in a centralized setting.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, it should be noted that the method has some limitations that must be taken into account. As it is designed for neural network without hidden layers, it has much less representation power than other deeper networks. Despite this, in some scenarios, for example in IoT environments where low computing power devices are used, this may be the only alternative for clients to be trained on edge devices with low computing performance, such as Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As future work, we consider the possibility of designing more powerful algorithms for more complex models, such as using the proposed method as a building block for more efficient deeper models.</p>
