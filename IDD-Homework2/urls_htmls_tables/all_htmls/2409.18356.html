<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning has attracted much attention as a privacy-preserving integrated analysis that enables integrated analysis of data held by multiple institutions without sharing raw data.
On the other hand, federated learning requires iterative communication across institutions and has a big challenge for implementation in situations where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely difficult.
In this study, we propose a federated data collaboration learning (FedDCL), which solves such communication issues by combining federated learning with recently proposed non-model share-type federated learning named as data collaboration analysis.
In the proposed FedDCL framework, each user institution independently constructs dimensionality-reduced intermediate representations and shares them with neighboring institutions on intra-group DC servers.
On each intra-group DC server, intermediate representations are transformed to incorporable forms called collaboration representations.
Federated learning is then conducted between intra-group DC servers.
The proposed FedDCL framework does not require iterative communication by user institutions and can be implemented in situations where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely difficult.
The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed FedDCL is comparable to that of existing federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is a growing demand for integrated analysis of medical data owned by multiple institutions or countries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
However, sharing the original medical data is difficult because of privacy concerns, and even if it were possible, we would have to pay huge costs.
Therefore, methods to achieve privacy-preserving analysis in which datasets are collaboratively analyzed without sharing the original data are attracting attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A typical technology for this topic is a federated learning system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>,
Federated learning iteratively updates the integrated model by aggregating information calculated independently on each user institution.
Federated learning enables construction of the integrated model without sharing raw data through iterative model updates that share machine learning models.
On the other hand, federated learning requires iterative communication across institutions and has a big challenge for implementation in situations where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely difficult.
For example, medical data may be stored on a server isolated from external networks, making continuous communication with the outside extremely difficult.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A motivating example of this paper is privacy-preserving medical data analysis in situation where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely difficult for user institutions (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.1 Background ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedDCL: a federated data collaboration learning as a hybrid-type privacy-preserving framework based on federated learning and data collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
If the analysis is conducted using only data from a single municipality, the accuracy may be insufficient because of the small sample size, specifically for rare diseases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, we consider integrated analysis of medical data owned by multiple institutions or countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this situation, raw data are held in a distributed manner by multiple medical institutions, which also organize into multiple groups based on affiliated hospitals and the municipality or country to which they belong.
Raw data is stored on data servers at each medical institution, and the institutions’ servers are not in continuous communication with the outside world.
On the other hand, each institution group would have a server that cannot store the raw data, but can communicate continuously with the outside world.
Each institution’s server can perform temporarily secure communication (e.g., data transfer via external storage devices) with the intra-group server.</p>

Federated learning is typically based on (deep) neural network and updates the model iteratively with iterative communication between user institutions and a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

FedSGD is a direct extension of the stochastic gradient descent method.
In each iteration of the gradient descent method, each user locally computes a gradient from the shared model using the local dataset and sends the gradient to the server.
The shared gradients are averaged and used to update the model.</p>

This is called FedAvg.
In FedAvg, each user updates the model using the local dataset and sends the updated model to the central server.
Then, the shared models are averaged to update.
FedAvg can reduce the communication frequency than FedSGD.</p>

FedDCL consists of the following five steps:
Step 1. Construction of shareable pseudo anchor dataset;
Step 2. Construction of intermediate representation;
Step 3. Construction of collaboration representation;
Step 4. Construction of integrated model for collaboration representation;
Step 5. Construction of integrated model for raw dataset.</p>

The information held by the central FL server is basically equal to that for conventional federated learning.
As well as conventional federated learning, there is a possibility of information leakage from, e.g., gradient information.
However, while the information leakage risk of conventional federated learning is for raw data, the information leakage risk of FedDCL is for collaboration representations.

Note that the proposed FedDCL is a framework that can be easily combined with the latest federated learning mechanisms.
Therefore, in this paper, we just evaluate the performance with a simple <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedAvg</span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.3" class="ltx_p">For the machine learning model, we use fully connected neural network.
For all methods, we set batch size as 32.
For <span id="S4.SS1.p2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Centralized</span>, <span id="S4.SS1.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Local</span>, and <span id="S4.SS1.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DC</span>, the number of epoch is set as 40.

This is based on the fact that the convergence of <span id="S4.SS1.p2.3.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedAvg</span> is generally lower than <span id="S4.SS1.p2.3.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Centralized</span>.

A part of intermediate and collaboration representations are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Experiment I: Proof-of-concept ‣ 4 Numerical evaluations ‣ FedDCL: a federated data collaboration learning as a hybrid-type privacy-preserving framework based on federated learning and data collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
These results indicate that the intermediate and collaboration representations do not directly approximate the features of the raw data.
Focusing on the range of values in each column, we see that the intermediate representation varies widely from institution to institution, while the collaboration representation is generally consistent.
It is not possible to recover the raw data only from the intermediate and collaboration representations.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there has been a growing need for privacy-preserving integrated analysis for medical data held by multiple institutions.
Medical data may be stored on a server isolated from external networks, making continuous communication with the outside extremely difficult.
Therefore, developments of technologies for privacy-preserving integrated analysis without any iterative communications by user institutions are essential.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose the FedDCL framework, which solves such communication issues by combining federated learning with the data collaboration analysis; see Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1.2 Purpose and contributions ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedDCL: a federated data collaboration learning as a hybrid-type privacy-preserving framework based on federated learning and data collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
FedDCL is the first method to combine federated learning and data collaboration analysis.
FedDCL has experimentally shown comparable analysis performance to existing federated learning and data collaboration analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FedDCL is a framework that can be easily combined with the latest federated learning mechanisms and deployed on a variety of data and tasks.
Therefore, FedDCL could become a breakthrough technology for future privacy-preserving analyses on multiple institutions in situations where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely difficult.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Performance evaluations for parameter dependency and for non-IID distributed data have been done separately for federated learning and data collaboration analysis.
A similar evaluation for FedDCL is a future task.
In the future, we will develop the method and software.</p>
