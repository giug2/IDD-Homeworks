<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep neural networks are susceptible to various inference attacks as they <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">remember</span> information about their training data. We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our novel <span id="id2.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">white-box membership inference attacks</span> against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is <span id="id2.id2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the</span> algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep neural networks have shown unprecedented generalization for various learning tasks, from image and speech recognition to generating realistic-looking data. This success has led to many applications and services that use deep learning algorithms on large-dimension (and potentially sensitive) user data, including user speeches, images, medical records, financial data, social relationships, and location data points. In this paper, we are interested in answering the following critical question: What is the privacy risk of deep learning algorithms to individuals whose data is used for training deep neural networks? In other words, how much is the information leakage of deep learning algorithms about their individual training data samples?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We define privacy-sensitive leakage of a model, about its training data, as the information that an adversary can learn from the model about them, which he is not able to infer from other models that are trained on other data from the same distribution. This distinguishes between the information that we can learn from the model about the data population, and the information that the model leaks about the particular data samples which are in its training set. The former indicates utility gain, and the later reflects privacy loss. We design inference attacks to quantify such privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inference attacks on machine learning algorithms fall into two fundamental and related categories: <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">tracing</em> (a.k.a. membership inference) attacks, and <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">reconstruction</em> attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In a reconstruction attack, the attacker’s objective is to infer attributes of the records in the training set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In a membership inference attack, however, the attacker’s objective is to infer if a particular individual data record was included in the training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This is a decisional problem, and its accuracy directly demonstrates the leakage of the model about its training data. We thus choose this attack as the basis for our privacy analysis of deep learning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have studied membership inference attacks against machine learning models in the <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">black-box</em> setting, where the attacker can only observe the model predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The results of these works show that the distribution of the training data as well as the generalizability of the model significantly contribute to the membership leakage. Particularly, they show that overfitted models are more susceptible to membership inference attacks than generalized models. Such black-box attacks, however, might not be effective against deep neural networks that generalize well (having a large set of parameters). Additionally, in a variety of real-world settings, the parameters of deep learning algorithms are visible to the adversaries, e.g., in a federated learning setting where multiple data holders collaborate to train a global model by sharing their parameter updates with each other through an aggregator.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Our contributions.</span>  In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for the privacy analysis of deep neural networks, using white-box membership inference attacks. We go beyond membership inference attacks against fully-trained models. We take all major scenarios where deep learning is used for training and fine-tuning or updating models, with one or multiple collaborative data holders, when attacker only passively observes the model updates or actively influences the target model in order to extract more information, and for attackers with different types of prior knowledge. Despite differences in knowledge, observation, and actions of the adversary, their objective is the same: <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">membership inference</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A simple extension of existing black-box membership inference attacks to the white-box setting would be using the same attack on all of the activation functions of the model. Our empirical evaluations show that this will not result in inference accuracy better than that of a black-box attacker. This is because the activation functions in the model tend to generalize much faster compared to the output layer. The early layers of a trained model extract very simple features that are not specific to the training data. The activation functions in the last layers extract complex and abstract features, thus should contain more information about the model’s training set. However, this information is more or less the same as what the output leaks about the training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We design white-box inference attacks that <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">exploit the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm</span>. Each data point in the training set influences many of the model parameters, through the SGD algorithm, to minimize its contribution to the model’s training loss. The local gradient of the loss on a target data record, with respect to a given parameter, indicates how much and in which direction the parameter needs to be changed to fit the model to the data record. To minimize the expected loss of the model, the SGD algorithm repeatedly updates model parameters in a direction that the gradient of the loss over the whole training dataset leans to <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">zero</span>. Therefore, <span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">each training data sample will leave a distinguishable footprint on the gradients of the loss function over the model’s parameters</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We use the gradient vector of the model, over all parameters, on the target data point, as the main feature for the attack. We design deep learning attack models with an architecture that processes extracted (gradient) features from different layers of the target model separately, and combines their information to compute the membership probability of a target data point. We train the attack model for attackers with different types of background knowledge. Assuming a subset of the training set is known to the attacker, we can train the attack model in a supervised manner. However, for the adversary that lacks this knowledge, we train the attack model in an <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">unsupervised</span> manner. We train auto-encoders to compute a membership information embedding for any data. We then use a clustering algorithm, on the target dataset, to separate members from non-members based on their membership embedding.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use membership inference attacks to measure the information leakage through deep learning models about their training data. There are many different scenarios in which data is used for training models, and there are many different ways the attacker can observe the deep learning process. In Table <a href="#S2.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ II Inference Attacks ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, we cover the major criteria to categorize the attacks. This includes attack observations, assumptions about the adversary knowledge, the target training algorithm, and the mode of the attack based on the adversary’s actions. In this section, we discuss different attack scenarios as well as the techniques we use to exploit deep learning algorithms. We also describe the architecture of our attack model, and how the adversary computes the membership probability.</p>

As a simple extension, the attacker can extend black-box membership inference attacks (which are limited to the model’s output) to the outputs of all activation functions of the model. However, this does not necessarily contain all the useful information for membership inference. Notably, the model output and activation functions could generalize if the model is well regularized. Thus, there might not be much difference, in distribution, between the activation functions of a model on its training versus unseen data. This can significantly limit the power of the inference attacks (as we also show in our evaluations).</p>

Given the large number of parameters used in deep neural networks (millions of parameters), the vector with such a significantly large dimension cannot properly generalize over the training data (which in many cases is an order of magnitude smaller in size). Therefore, the distribution of the model’s gradients on members of its training data, versus non-members, is likely to be distinguishable. This can help the adversary to run an accurate membership inference attack, even though the classification model (with respect to its predictions) is well-generalized.</p>

The significance of gradient (as well as activation) computations for a membership inference attack varies over the layers of a deep neural network. The first layers tend to contain less information about the specific data points in the training set, compared to non-member data record from the same underlying distribution. We can provide the gradients and activations of each layer as separate inputs to the attacker, as the attacker might need to design a specific attack for each layer. This enables the inference attack to split the inference task across different layers of the model, and then combine them to determine the membership. This engineering of the attack model architecture empowers the inference attack, as it reduces the capacity of the attack model and helps finding the optimal attack algorithm with less background data.</p>

To extract features from the output of each layer, plus the one-hot encoding of the true label and the loss, we use fully connected network (FCN) submodules with one hidden layer. We use convolutional neural network (CNN) submodules for the gradients. When the gradients are computed on fully connected layers (in the target model), we set the size of the convolutional kernel to the input size of the fully connected layer, to capture the correlation of the gradients in each activation function. We reshape the output of each submodule component into a flat vector, and then concatenate the output of all components.
We combine the outputs of all attack feature extraction components using a fully connected encoder component with multiple hidden layers. The output of the encoder is a single score, which is the output of the attack. This score (in the supervised attack raining) predicts the membership probability of the input data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The active attacker can exploit the SGD algorithm to run the active attack. The insight we use to design our attack is that the SGD algorithm forcefully decreases the gradient of the loss on the training data, with the hope that this generalizes to the test data as well. The amount of the changes depends on the contribution of a data point in the loss. So, if a training data point leads to a large loss, the SGD algorithm will influence some parameters to adapt themselves towards reducing the loss on this point. If the data point is not seen by the model during training, the changes in the gradient on this point is gradual throughout the training. This is what we exploit in our active membership inference attack.</p>

Shadow models are models with the same architecture as the target model. The training data records for the shadow models are generated from the same distribution as the target training data, but do not have a known overlap with the target training set. The attacker trains the attack model on the shadow models. As the behavior of the shadow models on their training data is more or less similar to the behavior of the target model on its training data, the attack models trained on the shadow models are empirically shown to be effective.</p>

As previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> as well as our empirical results show, these features are strong signals for distinguishing members from non-members. The encoder-decoder architecture maximizes the information that the attack output contains about these features. Thus, it generates a membership embedding for each data point. Note that after training the attack model, the decoder plays no role in the membership inference attack.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The attack in the unsupervised setting is a batch attack, where the adversary attacks a large set of data records (disjoint from his background knowledge). We will use the encoder to for each target data record, and we compute the embedding value (output of the encoder model). Next, we use a clustering algorithm (e.g., we use the spectral clustering method) to cluster each input of the target model in two clusters. Note that the outcome of the clustering algorithm is a threshold, as the attack output is a single number. We predict the cluster with the larger gradient norm as non-members.</p>

To understand and demonstrate the impact of different layers’ outputs, we perform the attack separately using the outputs of <em id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">individual layers</em>.
We use a pre-trained Alexnet model as the target model, where the model is composed of five convolutional layers and a fully connected layer at the end.

As the table shows, using the last layers results in the highest attack accuracy, i.e., <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">among the layer outputs, the last layer (model output) leaks the most membership information about the training data</span>.The reason behind this is twofold.
By proceeding to the later layers, the capacity of the parameters ramps up, which leads the target model to store unnecessary information about the training dataset, and therefore leak more information. Moreover, the first layers extract simple features from the input, thus generalize much better compared to the last layers, which are responsible for complex task of finding the relationship between abstract features and the classes. We did not achieve significant accuracy gain by combining the outputs from multiple layers; this is because the leakage from the last layer (which is equivalent to a black-box inference attack) already contains the membership information that leaks from the output of the previous layers.</p>

We validate this claim by evaluating the attack for different classes in CIFAR100-Alexnet with different prediction uncertainties.
Specifically, we selected three classes with small, medium, and high differences of prediction uncertainties, where the attack accuracies are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Stand-Alone Setting: Attacking Fully-Trained Models ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> for these classes.

the attacker has data points sampled from the same underlying distribution, but he does not know their member and non-member labels.
In this case, the attacker classifies the tested records into two clusters as described in Section <a href="#S2.SS4" title="II-D Prior Knowledge: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Inference ‣ II Inference Attacks ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-D</span></span></a>.</p>

Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> introduced earlier.
We train our unsupervised models on various datasets based on the training and test dataset sizes in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ III-F Evaluation Metrics ‣ III Experimental Setup ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
We train a single Shadow model on each of Texas100 and Purchase100 datasets using training sizes according to Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ III-F Evaluation Metrics ‣ III Experimental Setup ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. The training sets of the Shadow models do no overlap with the training sets of the target models.
For the CIFAR100 dataset, however, our Shadow model uses a training dataset that overlaps with the target model’s dataset, as we do not have enough instances (we train each model with 50,000 instances out of the total 60,000 available records).</p>

When the attacker has access to several training epochs in the CIFAR100 target models, he achieves a high membership attack accuracy. In Texas100 and Purchase100 datasets, however, the accuracy of the attack decreases compare to the stand-alone setting. This is due to the fact that <em id="S4.SS4.p4.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">averaging in the federated learning scenarios will reduce the impact of each individual party</em>.</p>

We use the same attack model architecture as that of the global attack.
In our experiments, there are four participants (including the local attacker). The goal of the attacker is to learn if a target input has been a member of the training data of any other participants.

As expected, a local attack has a lower accuracy compared to the global attack; this is because the local attacker observes the <em id="S4.SS4.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregate</em> model parameters of all participants, which limits the extent of membership leakage. <em id="S4.SS4.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The accuracy of the local attacker degrades for larger numbers of participants</em>.

The active attack is described in Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="II-C Attack Mode: Passive vs. Active Inference Attack ‣ II Inference Attacks ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-C</span></span></a>. We evaluate the attack accuracy on predicting the membership of 100 randomly sampled member instances, from the target model, and 100 non-member instances.
For all such target instances (whose membership is unknown to the attacker), the attacker updates their data features towards ascending the gradients of the global model (in case of the global attack) or the local model (in the case of a local attack).</p>

As Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Federated Learning Settings: Passive Inference Attacks ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a> shows, when the attacker ascends on the gradients of the target instances, the gradient norm of the target members will be very similar to that of non-target member instances in various training epochs.
On the other hand, this is not true for the non-member instances as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Federated Learning Settings: Passive Inference Attacks ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, this is because applying the gradient ascent algorithm on a member instance will trigger the target model to try to minimize its loss by descending in the direction of the model’s gradient for those instances (and therefore nullify the effect of the attacker’s ascent). For target non-member instances, however, the model will not explicitly change their gradient, as they do not influence the training loss function. The attacker repeats gradient ascend algorithm for each epoch of the training, therefore, the gradient of the model will keep increasing on such non-member instances. Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf3" title="In Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Federated Learning Settings: Passive Inference Attacks ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Comprehensive Privacy Analysis of Deep Learning: Passive and Active White-box Inference Attacks against Centralized and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(c)</span></a> depicts the resulted distinction between the gradient norm of the member and non-member target instances. The active gradient ascend attacker forces the target model to behave drastically different between target member and target non-member instances which makes the membership inference attack easier. As a result, compared to the passive global attacker we see that the active attack can noticeably gain higher accuracy. In the local case, the accuracy is lower than the global attack due to the observation of aggregated parameters from multiple participants.</p>

An active global attacker can overcome this problem by isolating a target participant, and creating a local view of the network for it. In this scenario, the attacker does not send the aggregate parameters of all parties to the target party. Instead, the attacker isolates the target participant and segregates the target participant’s learning process.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We designed and evaluated novel white-box membership inference attacks against neural network models by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
We demonstrated our attacks in the stand-alone and federated settings, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.
We showed that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to such white-box membership inference attacks. Our work did not investigate theoretical bounds on the privacy leakage of deep learning in the white-box setting, which would remain as a topic of future research.</p>
