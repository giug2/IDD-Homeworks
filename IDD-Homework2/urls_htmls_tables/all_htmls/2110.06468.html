<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Graph neural network (GNN) has achieved great success on graph representation learning. Challenged by large scale private data collected from user-side, GNN may not be able to reflect the excellent performance, without rich features and complete adjacent relationships. Addressing the problem, vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed to implement local data protection through training a global model collaboratively. Consequently, for graph-structured data, it is a natural idea to construct a GNN based VFL framework, denoted as GVFL. However, GNN has been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Whether the vulnerability will be brought into the GVFL has not been studied. This is the first study of adversarial attacks on GVFL. A novel adversarial attack method is proposed, named Graph-Fraudster. It generates adversarial perturbations based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the gradient of pairwise node. Specifically, first, Graph-Fraudster steals the global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack generator. Second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow model. At last, the gradient of pairwise node is used to generate attacks with the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with baselines in different GNN based GVFLs. Furthermore, Graph-Fraudster can remain a threat to GVFL even if two possible defense mechanisms are applied. Additionally, some suggestions are put forward for the future work to improve the robustness of GVFL. The code and datasets can be downloaded at https://github.com/hgh0545/Graph-Fraudster.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, a privacy-preserving and distributed learning paradigm, establishes machine learning models based on distributed datasets across multiple parties/devices. It aims to protect client’s local data and mitigate privacy leakage in the context of legal restrictions, user side privacy protection and commercial competition. Benefiting from the collaborative training of the server model and privacy protection of the local raw data,
FL may be widely applied to various industries, e.g., mobile service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, face annotation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. According to the data distribution characteristic, FL can be roughly categorized into horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL) and federated transfer learning (FTL). HFL is suitable for the clients sharing datasets of same feature space but different examples, while VFL is designed for the clients sharing datasets of same
examples but different feature spaces. FTL is proposed for the client’s dataset diffs neither in feature space nor in examples. Among the three FLs, most studies are focused on HFL  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, while the other two still need to be further explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical data distribution is typical in real-world applications, for instance, financial data (e.g., transaction records, income) is often vertically partitioned and owned by different financial institutions (e.g., banks or lending platforms). The banks attempt to avoid lending to users with low credit ratings. Thus, a reliable evaluation agency is necessary to assess the same users among finical parties while sharing different features. To avoid raw data sharing between banks, a VFL framework is a good option for such a practical scenario. As described, some financial data can be constructed as graphs. Consequently, graph neural network (GNN) based VFL, denoted as GVFL, is suitable for this scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In such a practical scenario, there could be some potential threats in GVFL. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Graph-Fraudster: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network Based Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the threat model of the adversarial attack on GVFL. To be evaluated as high credit rating users, some may hide their true behaviors by adding some extra transaction records. Even worse, some dishonest lending platforms may tamper their data to help the low credit rating users by evading the detection of the evaluation agency. These maliciously crafted operations will cause the bank to issue loans to low-credit users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We further analyze the possibility of the adversarial attack on GVFL, and find out that the threats could come from the innate deficiency in GVFL. Specifically, each participant in GVFL uploads the intermediate information, i.e., the node embeddings extracted by the local GNN model instead of the raw data. The adversarial perturbations (e.g., fake relationship, extra transaction record) on the local raw data will influence the updated node embeddings, thus posing a threat to the server model by making a wrong decision. Besides, privacy leakage of embeddings of GVFL will provide conditions for adversarial attacks, e.g., the leakage of the embeddings will help the malicious client to establish a precise shadow model of the server. These threats of adversarial attacks on GVFL have not been studied yet. Motivated by the practical application of GVFL and its potential vulnerability towards adversarial attacks, a novel attack method is proposed in this paper as the first work of security research of GVFL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Though FL has shown the superiority in various domains, it has not been widely applied to graph-structured data. According to the investigation, most of the research focus on horizontal scenarios. For instance, considering data privacy preservation in non-independent identically and distribution (Non-IID), Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> used clients to implement message communication, and leveraged Bayesian optimization for hyper-parameters fine-tuning. They further proposed a novel learning paradigm, named ASFGNN. Inspired by meta learning, GraphFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is proposed to address the node classification under Non-IID. These proposed FLs are supported by machine learning models designed for graph mining. In the aspect of GNN as the local model for FL, He et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> presented FedGraphNN, an open-source FL system based on GNN models. But it is not suitable for VFL. As for GNN based vertical federated learning, the research is still in its fancy. Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> gave the first vertical learning paradigm for privacy-preserving GNN models for node classification, by splitting the graph into two parts for different clients. Secure muti-party computation is adopted as well to ensure data privacy and efficiency. To ensure privacy, Ni et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> adopted additively homomorphic encryption, and proposed a federated GCN learning paradigm for the privacy-preserving node classification task, named FedVGCN. Besides the framework study of GNN based FL, it is also applied to real-world applications. For instance, Wu et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a GNN structured FL for recommendation to accomplish server model training and user-side privacy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the inference attack on GNN based federated learning has not been studied yet, we summarize some inference attacks on federated learning.
Numerous attacks on HFL have been proposed. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, generative adversarial network is used for inference attack on HFL for the first time, which generates the same distribution as the training data. Nasr et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> exploited the vulnerability of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and designed a membership attack in white-box setting. Besides, deep leakage from gradients (DLG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> uses public shared gradients to obtain the local training data without extra knowledge of the data. To sum up, most of them greatly rely on the gradient which exchanged during training process. In vertical scenarios, Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> formulated the problem of feature inference attack in model’s inference process for the first time, and they proposed two attack methods on the logistic regression (LR) and decision tree (DT) models, named equality solving attack (ESA) and path restriction attack (PRA), respectively. Further, they proposed a general attack method named generative regression network attack to handle more complex models. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> devoted to gathering the man-made poison data and the corresponding intermediate outputs in the model’s training process. Then they built the training set for the decoder to recover other private data of the victim. Besides, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> explored whether the labels can be uncovered by sharing gradient in the VFL setting, and proposed a label inference attack method based on the gradient norm.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing technologies may have multiple vulnerabilities that enable hackers or criminals to manipulate data for malicious purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and the adversarial examples may jeopardize the operation of the reality systems such as the Internet of Things <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Extensive studies have proven that GNN models are vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial perturbations that affect the performance of downstream applications. For node classification, Zügner et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed the first adversarial attack on GNN models, denoted as NETTACK, by generating attacks iteratively according to score functions. Reinforcement learning is applied to generate perturbations in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> as well. Aiming at fooling GNN models by attacking embeddings of the target node, Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed a fast gradient attack method (FGA) via the maximal absolute edge gradient. Analogously, IG-FGSM and IG-JSMA are introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. To deal with the large-scale graph, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a multi-stage attack framework SGA, which relies on a much smaller subgraph centered at the target node. Another modification strategy is proposed by inserting fake nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> instead of adding/deleting edges in the adversarial examples. Considering a black-box scenario, GF-Attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is constructed by the graph filter and feature matrix without accessing any knowledge of the target classifiers. For graph classification, Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> used rewiring to hide the adversarial edges, which preserves some important properties of the graph such as the number of nodes, edges and total degrees of the graph. For community detection, genetic algorithm is adopted in Q-Attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to fail the detection method. To sum up, the existing graph adversarial attacks mainly degrade the performance of GNN models in various tasks by adding or deleting key edges.</p>

One participant is randomly selected as the malicious participant from all. The adversarial attack is conducted through three stages: (1) stealing embeddings: a global node embeddings is generated, which adjusted by querying result of trained server model; (2) adding noises: noises are added into the generated embeddings to attack the shadow model of the server; (3) generating adversarial attacks: guided by noise-added node embeddings of malicious participant, adversarial attacks are generated by using gradient of pairwise node. As a result, the wrong prediction of the target node will be produced by the trained server model.</figcaption>

In other word, the malicious participant can attack the server model by manipulating its own data merely. In addition, the trained server model will be served as an API for the malicious participant, and it only returns probability for each query. Thus, more details, such as the parameters of the server model and the gradient information, are unable to be obtained by the malicious participant.</p>

During the aggregate process, modifying the edges affects all dimensions of features belonging to the target node, while modifying features only affects a few features. Thus, Graph-Fraudster is designed to attack the server model by manipulating edges of the local graph. It is conducted through three stages: (1) stealing node embeddings of other participants; (2) adding noises into embeddings via constructing the shadow server model; (3) generating adversarial attacks to mislead the global GVFL. The framework of Graph-Fraudster is shown as Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Problem Definition ‣ III Methodology ‣ Graph-Fraudster: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network Based Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In order to degrade the performance of the server model, it’s significant to produce the adversarial embeddings crossing the decision boundary to mislead the server model. An effective and efficient method is using the gradient information of the server model to produce adversarial examples, which has been widely used to construct attack on GNN. However, in GVFL, the attackers cannot get gradient information but only the returned probabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a shadow model in local to simulate the server model. By stealing the global node embeddings, the shadow model <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tilde{\mathcal{S}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒮</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">~</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">~</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝒮</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\tilde{\mathcal{S}}</annotation></semantics></math> can be successfully established based on the necessary knowledge, i.e., training data <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="h_{fake}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">h</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">f</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4.cmml">k</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1b" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5.cmml">e</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">ℎ</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">𝑓</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">𝑎</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.4">𝑘</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.5">𝑒</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1c">h_{fake}</annotation></semantics></math>, model structure and target probabilities <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math>.

Assuming there are no overlap edges for each client, then with more clients participant in, the more isolated nodes appear in clients’ graph data. It will be not conducive to collaboratively train the server model.
Consequently, two splitting strategies are adopted for different number of clients. Specifically, for dual-participants, both edges and node features of the dataset are divided into two parts on average, in which a small part of isolated nodes will appear. For multi-participant, node features are divided averagely to each participant, and the complete topology of the graph is retained. Due to the randomness of the segmentation, the dataset is divided and tested for 10 times. The average accuracy of the trained server model will be recorded.</p>

For Pol.Blogs, it can be seen that the performance of GVFL drops less than other datasets under attacks. For example, Graph-Fraudster reduces the GVFL’s performance by about 21%, 20.8%, 24.1%, corresponding to GCN, SGC and RGCN respectively, but gains more than 25% on the other datasets. It is caused by the rich relationships of Pol.Blogs which make attacks more difficult within limited perturbation budget. It’s worth mentioning that the standard deviation shows that Graph-Fraudster is more stable than NETTACK and FGA generally.

It can be analyzed that the local GNN models cannot capture complete node information while edges are assigned to different participants, which weakens the quality of the local node embeddings. Furthermore, GVFL performs better on the graph with higher degree, e.g., the performance of GVFL based on GCN drops by 8.7% on Cora (the average degree is 2.00) while it only drops by 3.2% on Pol.Blogs (the average degree is 13.68). There are similar results on different GVFLs. The phenomenon can be interpreted as the denser the graph can retain more relational information after data segmentation.</p>

Moreover, more nodes gain low classification margin than NETTACK and FGA, under Graph-Fraudster’s attack, on Cora_ML. Although, for Pol.Blogs, all attack methods cannot achieve the same performance as well as other datasets due to its density. Graph-Fraudster still performs better. On Pubmed, Graph-Fraudster achieves similar performance to NETTACK and FGA, but stays ahead. For RND, only a few nodes obtains low classification margin, which explains its worst attack performance. Additionally, there are still some nodes with higher classification margin, corresponding to nodes that have not been successfully attacked. It may be caused by the single-edge attack, which is unable to make the GVFL misclassify these nodes.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The above experiments suggest that GVFL suffers from adversarial attacks. Although the existing adversarial attacks transferable to GVFL are not powerful enough without the knowledge of GVFL, GVFL still performs as expected. It reveals that GVFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The vulnerability may be caused by the GNN model. The adversarial attacks make the GNN model extract the node embedding vector incorrectly and finally confuse the server model. Further, benefiting from the global node embeddings leakage in GVFL, Graph-Fraudster establishes a shadow server model which guides the attack to succeed. More knowledge of GVFL helps the performance of attacks, which explains the superior performance of Graph-Fraudster.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">More generally, there are multiple participants in FL. In order to verify the capacity of Graph-Fraudster, the number of participants is set from 2 to 6 in the experiments. To avoid the emergence of numerous isolated nodes, we just distribute node features randomly to each participant without segmentation of edges. Since Pol.Blogs has no node features, the experiments will be conducted on the remaining four datasets. The results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-E1 Attack on Dual-participants Based GVFL ‣ IV-E Attack Performance ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Graph-Fraudster: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network Based Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p2.5" class="ltx_p">First, comparing to edges segmentation, the performance of GVFL is more close to the centralized GNN models in this setting due to the retention of complete relationships between node pairs. Then, as the number of participants increases, the accuracy of GVFL decreases gradually. It is caused by information loss in node features segmentation. Same as edges segmentation setting, Graph-Fraudster maintains optimal attack performance with two participants. In general, the performance of attack methods decreases with the increasing of participants number. Because the server model treats every participant equally, as the number of participants increases, the contribution of the malicious participant’s node embeddings decreases. As a result, the server model is harder to be confused. For example, on Pubmed, all attack methods almost fail with the single-edge attack when the participant number is 6. Interestingly, it not always happens in the experiments. Taking Citeseer as an example, the accuracy of GVFL falls when the number of participants are 6. We give the relationship between attack performance of Graph-Fraudster and contribution of the malicious participant in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-E1 Attack on Dual-participants Based GVFL ‣ IV-E Attack Performance ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Graph-Fraudster: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network Based Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

It can be observed that on Cora_ML, when the number of participants increases, the contribution of participants gradually decreases, and the server model is less susceptible to attacks. On Citeseer, when the number of participants is 6, the proportion of malicious participant’s contribution increases, causing the server model to be attacked by Graph-Fraudster. We attribute the reason to the segmentation of the dataset. In this setting, the node features are divided randomly, which may cause that not all participants get useful node features. Thus, a small perturbation is powerful enough to fool the server model. On the contrary, the performance drops when the benign participants get some key node features and the slight structural perturbation from malicious participants is not enough to affect the performance of the server model. That is, the model is biased against the data. Besides, the properties of datasets affect attack performance. Taking Citeseer, which is the most sparse, and it can be seen that Graph-Fraudster maintains good attack performance. Due to its sparseness, it improves the influence of structural attacks on the perturbations of the local node embeddings.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, in the multi-participant case, with the number of participants increases, the performance of attackers generally shows a downward trend. It may be caused by the influence of the server model of each participant decreases while the number of participants increases. Thus, considering adding perturbations into both structure and node features may a better strategy, and it will be considered in our future work. Further, the model’s bias against the data is one of the possible reasons for the success of the adversarial attack. It indicates data bias of the model may lead the server model more rely on high-contributing participants. As a result, it is easier for attacks which initiated by high-contributing participants to cheat the server model. Therefore, setting up a fair evaluation mechanism for participants may help to improve the robustness of GVFL against adversarial attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To explain the attack results of Graph-Fraudster better, the decision boundaries on Pol.Blogs before and after attack are plotted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-E1 Attack on Dual-participants Based GVFL ‣ IV-E Attack Performance ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Graph-Fraudster: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network Based Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. The setting is the same as dual-participants based GVFL. Combining the accuracy of the server model, the decision boundary is regular without perturbations, which corresponds to high accuracy. After attack, as mentioned in the previous experiments, the server model is not easy to be perturbed with high accuracy. However, some nodes break away from their corresponding groups, which makes the decision boundary fracture. In other words, these outliers will be misclassified.</p>

It is caused by the non-concentrated distribution of perturbations in the node embeddings. Specifically, the perturbations do not only exist in lower values. Moreover, the price of better defensive capability against Graph-Fraudster is the performance degradation of the main task. In summary, Graph-Fraudster can still perform well under two possible defense mechanisms. In future works, filtering perturbations from the local node embeddings is a feasible solution against adversarial attacks in GVFL, and keeping the performance of GVFL while gains defensive capability is also a great challenge.</p>

Benefiting from the information of GVFL, Graph-Fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with the baselines. Extensive experiments have testified the effectiveness and efficiency of Graph-Fraudster and further revealed the vulnerability of GVFL even under defensive circumstances.</p>

(1) GVFL does suffer from adversarial attacks, especially when some information (e.g., node embeddings, structure of model and gradient of model etc.) is explored by the attackers; (2) graph splitting strategy of GVFL will not only affect the performance of GVFL, but also affect the success rate of adversarial attack, thus a proper splitting strategy should be seriously considered in real-world scenarios; (3) the more a participant contributes to the server, the more likely the perturbations added to the participant is to construct a successful adversarial attack; (4) although DP and Top-<math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> fail to fully defend Graph-Fraudster, the results show that denoising the uploaded node embeddings is still a feasible defensive strategy.</p>

However, the small number of perturbations does not mean that the perturbations are imperceptible, and these perturbations may change some properties of the graph significantly. Besides, frequent queries are needed for Graph-Fraudster, which are expensive and detectable.</p>

There are two sides of suggestions are provided for future works. <span id="S5.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Recommendations for vulnerability mining:</span> (1) For perturbation strategies, both structure and node features should be considered for perturbation, to reduce the impact of the data imbalance of attacks. (2) Since frequent queries on the server model are expensive and abnormal, reducing queries by stealing more information from GVFL is a possible solution. (3) Exploring the concealment of the perturbations for diverse downstream tasks, such as link prediction, graph classification, should be discussed as well. <span id="S5.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Suggestions for defenders:</span> (1) Researchers are advised to focus on the information leakage problem on GVFL, which provides convenience for attackers. Preventing key information of GVFL from privacy inferencing is a direct and efficient method. (2) A fair evaluation agency for participants should be established. Over-reliance on high-contributing participants may bring potential security risks, i.e., the impact of adversarial attacks may be amplified by the data bias of the model. (3) Some defense or detection mechanisms can be deployed in terminals or servers to eliminate the impact of adversarial perturbations.</p>
