<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm that trains neural networks on edge devices without collecting data at a central server.
However, FL encounters an inherent challenge in dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among devices.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hard feature matching data synthesis (HFMDS) method to share auxiliary data besides local models.
Specifically, synthetic data are generated by learning the essential class-relevant features of real samples and discarding the redundant features, which helps to effectively tackle the non-IID issue.
For better privacy preservation, we propose a hard feature augmentation method to transfer real features towards the decision boundary, with which the synthetic data not only improve the model generalization but also erase the information of real features.
By integrating the proposed HFMDS method with FL, we present a novel FL framework with data augmentation to relieve data heterogeneity.
The theoretical analysis highlights the effectiveness of our proposed data synthesis method in solving the non-IID challenge.
Simulation results further demonstrate that our proposed HFMDS-FL algorithm outperforms the baselines in terms of accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational cost on various benchmark datasets.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The
development of deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling the creation of more accurate and sophisticated AI applications in edge devices, such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, virtual reality (VR) services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and unmanned aerial vehicle control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
However, the success of DL depends on the quantity and quality of training data, and the collection and analysis of data pose a severe risk to individual privacy.
To prevent the privacy risks associated with data collection and analysis, federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that exploits distributed data and computational resources to collaboratively train a global DL model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In particular, instead of collecting the raw data as in centralized machine learning, FL algorithms, such as federated averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, preserve data privacy by allowing clients to independently update their local models, which are then aggregated by a trusted server through multiple training rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the types of clients, FL systems can be classified into the cross-device and cross-silo settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
In this work, we focus on the cross-device FL, where clients are typically edge devices (e.g., mobile phones and healthcare gadgets) with limited data and computational resources.
In cross-device FL systems, a grand challenge is the vast heterogeneity of data distributions among devices, namely the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) issue.
The existence of non-IID data is attributed by various factors such as different user behaviors, uneven data collection, or varying environmental conditions.
The negative impacts of the non-IID issue in FL have been well explored through theoretical analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and empirical experiments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
With a distinct data distribution gap between clients, their local updates adversely become diverged after local training, thereby resulting in a misguided global model and accuracy degradation.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate data heterogeneity in cross-device FL, many methods propose to modify the local training or global aggregation phase under the FedAvg framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
By leveraging the knowledge of the global model during the local training, the bias of local updates can be alleviated and thus the global model can converge along an unbiased direction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Besides, simply averaging the biased local updates at the server may lead to an imprecise global model.
Therefore, adjusting the aggregation weights for different local models or finetuning the global model via the knowledge of local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> can also relieve the non-IID problem.
These methods, however, focus on the algorithmic aspect and only achieve marginal performance gains, especially in the extreme non-IID cases where each client just has a few classes of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To fundamentally solve the non-IID issue, another stream of study mitigates the data distribution gap between clients via synthetic data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a general FL framework with synthetic data augmentation, where clients generate and share synthetic data with each other to relieve the data heterogeneity among clients.
Following this framework, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> utilized mixup data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> as the synthetic data to assist local training.
By averaging multiple samples and their corresponding labels, the mixup data become blurry and better preserve privacy compared with raw data.
However, since the mapping from the input space to the label space is non-linear, naively averaging images and labels leads to incorrect data pairs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
For example, the mixup data of digit ‘6’ and digit ‘9’ looks like digit ‘8’, but with a label of fifty-fifty probabilities for ‘6’ and ‘9’, respectively.
Consequently, the data mixup method only achieves limited improvement in model performance.
Besides, the mixup data contains rich information of real data in the input space, which exposes data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Alternatively, generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and variational autoencoders (VAEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> can be also used to generate synthetic data.
Despite the incredible ability of generative models in centralized training, they suffer from the local overfitting problem in FL and require an extremely long training time when being trained with non-IID data.
These challenges make it hard to be deployed in cross-device FL systems with limited data and scarce computational resources.
In addition, these generative models are optimized by learning the real data distribution, which promotes the synthetic data to be similar to real data, thus leading to severe privacy leakage.

This training paradigm in the input space instead of the model space significantly reduces the training overhead for data synthesis.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Non-IID problem in FL:</span>
The non-IID challenge of FL was first presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which was later shown to significantly affect the convergence and performance of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
To overcome this issue, many works, known as the client-centric methods, attempted to reformulate the local training objective by leveraging knowledge of the global model and local models from other clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> included a proximal term by restraining the local update using the global model.
SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> introduced the control variates to correct for the local drift during local training.
FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic regularizer for each client to parallelize the gradients among clients.
MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> utilized contrastive learning to reduce the distance between model representations to correct the local training.
These methods, however, cannot solve the essence of the non-IID problem and may encounter the performance bottleneck in extreme cases with highly skewed data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the local updates at clients, the server can also help to alleviate the negative impacts of non-IID data by calibrating the biased global model after aggregation.
In CCVR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the server rectifies the classifier with virtual representations sampled from an approximated Gaussian mixture model.
FedFTG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> calibrated the global model using data-free knowledge distillation with the knowledge of local models.
Moreover, client clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> can also be conducted by the server to relieve the non-IID problem.
IFCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> alternately estimated the cluster identities of clients via local empirical loss and updated the model parameters for each client cluster through gradient descent.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm that the server adaptively selects a subset of clients to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy under non-IID scenarios.
Our proposed algorithm is orthogonal to these methods and provides a new perspective to tackle the non-IID issue in FL.</p>

Recently, data augmentation techniques, including data manipulation and DL-based data synthesis, have been extensively investigated for generating synthetic data to be shared among clients in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
For data manipulation, a straightforward method is to allow clients to share a small portion of real data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which, however, is contradictory to
the privacy-preserving principle of FL.
To relieve such a risk, some early attempts proposed to share the mixup data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which is obtained by averaging the real samples, to mitigate the data heterogeneity in FL systems.
Mix2FLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> allowed clients to share mixup samples with the server and adopted an inverse engineer to generate inversely-mixup samples for federated distillation.
XorMixFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> let the server collect the processed data encoded using bit-wise XOR mixup and decode them for the centralized training.
In FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, clients share the mixup data with each other and update the local models using second-order optimization.
However, the unqualified mixup data caused by the mismatching between data and labels only achieve a limited performance improvement for FL, and the manipulation in the input space still severely leaks the privacy of real data.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The DL-based data synthesis methods conduct data synthesis by updating the generative models or optimizing the synthetic data directly.
A straightforward method is to train a qualified GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> that can be shared among clients to generate synthetic data and features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
FedGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and FedDPGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> allowed clients to collaboratively train a global generator under the FL framework and used it to generate synthetic data for mitigating data heterogeneity among clients.
In SDA-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, clients individually train a local generator and share them with each other.
Although the GAN-based methods are promising in solving the non-IID problem, the high computational resource demands for training the generator and discriminator limit their applicability in practical systems.
Besides, VHL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> instituted a virtual homogeneous dataset to calibrate the features from the heterogeneous clients, which can be generated from pure noise shared across clients.
Moreover, zero-shot learning was also applied for synthetic data generation to promote the fairness of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, but only knowing the global model is incapable of generating synthetic data with sufficient quality.</p>

However, this solution that requires real data sharing directly reveals the data privacy of clients.
To relieve the privacy leakage and solve the non-IID issue, instead of sharing the real data, a general FL framework is to share the synthetic data among clients.

Only the synthetic data carrying the task-relevant features can replace the real data to reduce the data heterogeneity among clients, and the invalid synthetic data contributes negatively to the training process and impairs the accuracy.
For example, the mixup data used in FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> achieve limited performance improvement.
This is because the vanilla averaging in the input space and label space results in the mismatching data pairs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy leakage:</span>
To preserve privacy, the synthetic data should carry minimum information about the real images, i.e., the synthetic data should be dissimilar to the real data.
However, since the mixup data used in FedMix are processed directly through the real data and the GAN-based synthetic data are generated by imitating the real data distribution, they look realistic and similar to the real data, thereby revealing the privacy of real data.</p>

Considering the limited computational resources at edge devices, the computation demands for data synthesis should be kept sufficiently low to ensure feasibility in cross-device FL systems.
However, the GAN-based synthetic methods require extremely high computation costs for training the generators and discriminators, which is not compatible with the cross-device systems.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">To verify the above discussion, we conduct a case study of FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, FedGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, and our proposed method HFMDS-FL on CIFAR-10 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> in a cross-device FL system with 20 clients, and each client has 2 classes of data.
The results in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Data Synthesis for Non-IID Problem ‣ 3 Problem Settings ‣ Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> show that FedMix obtains an excessively high Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value and FedGAN requires extremely high computational costs.
In comparison, HFMDS-FL is able to overcome these challenges and achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational cost saving.
In the next section, we will introduce the HFMDS, which is then integrated with FL to develop HFMDS-FL.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By integrating the proposed HFMDS method with FL, we propose the new framework of <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HFMDS-FL</span> to solve the non-IID issue in FL.
Different from existing works such as FedMix and FedGAN which conduct the data synthesis before the FL process, we perform data synthesis on-the-fly along the FL process.
This is because the quality of synthetic samples relies on the task relevance of real features, which can be better extracted by a well-trained global model.
Our proposed algorithm <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HFMDS-FL</span> is implemented based on FedAvg and the detailed procedures are summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4.3 Hard Feature Matching Data Synthesis (HFMDS) ‣ 4 Hard Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Federated Learning (HFMDS-FL) ‣ Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

We sample the real data and generate the synthetic data using FedMix, FedGAN, and HFMDS-FL on CIFAR-10.
We visualize the feature distribution of their synthetic data in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Analysis of HFMDS-FL ‣ Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
With the mixture of the same class of data for FedMix, some classes of data cannot have a similar feature distribution of original real data and tangle with other classes of data, e.g., class 1 (blue) and class 9 (cyan).
In FedGAN, the features of synthetic data generated by GANs have a distinct distribution gap with those of real data.
This is because the generative models require an extremely long time and numerous real data for training, and insufficient training time leads to unqualified synthetic data.
Compared with FedMix and FedGAN, our proposed method HFMDS-FL is able to generate synthetic data that have a compact and similar feature distribution with the real samples.
Also, with our proposed feature-matching objective function, the synthetic data quality of HFMDS-FL is insensitive to the real data number, generating the same-distribution synthetic data even with 100 real samples, which makes it more compatible with cross-device FL systems.</p>

Apart from FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, we compare the proposed algorithms with benchmarking FL algorithms specialized for solving the non-IID problem, including FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and FedGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, we also adopt two popular data augmentation algorithms for FL, including FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and FedGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> as baselines.
For fair comparisons, we do not include any differential privacy noise in the models of FedGAN.
The synthetic data in FedMix are averaged by two real samples.
To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed hard feature augmentation method, we also simulate the performance of FMDS-FL without hard feature augmentation, whose objective function is <math id="S6.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{L}_{\text{FM}}+\mathcal{L}_{C}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">ℒ</mi><mtext id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3a.cmml">FM</mtext></msub><mo id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><msub id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℒ</mi><mi id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">C</mi></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1"><plus id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></plus><apply id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2">ℒ</ci><ci id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3a.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3">FM</mtext></ci></apply><apply id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2">ℒ</ci><ci id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝐶</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{L}_{\text{FM}}+\mathcal{L}_{C}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

FedProx regulates the local training using parameter alignment while it is inferior to FedAvg in these highly skewed non-IID scenarios.
To alleviate data heterogeneity, MOON utilizes contrastive learning between the global model and the local model, and FedGen adopts feature augmentation with a feature generator.
However, they achieve similar or slightly better accuracy than FedAvg in most non-IID settings.
Besides, FedMix suffers from an accuracy degradation in most non-IID scenarios compared with FedAvg due to the mismatched mapping between the mixup samples and mixup labels.
FedGAN outperforms FedAvg on CIFAR-10 but achieves an unsatisfactory performance on CIFAR-100.
This is because the generative models for CIFAR-100 are difficult to train and insufficient training leads to unqualified synthetic data.
Besides, compared with FMDS-FL, HFMDS-FL achieves better accuracy in all non-IID cases with <math id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu=0.5" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">μ</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">0.5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">𝜇</ci><cn type="float" id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">0.5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">\mu=0.5</annotation></semantics></math> on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which evidences that the augmented hard features are able to move towards and smooth the decision boundary during the training process.

In addition, our proposed HFMDS-FL further decreases the PSNR values and protects the privacy of real samples better.
This is because the real features are augmented towards a hard transformation direction and thus more real information is erased.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table III ‣ 6.1 Performance Comparison ‣ 6 Performance evaluation ‣ Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, compared with FedMix and FedGAN, our proposed FMDS-FL and HFMDS-FL require lower computational costs for data synthesis and local training.
This is because, in FedMix, the second-order based regularization term used for data augmentation during local training significantly increases the computational costs.
Moreover, FedGAN requires an extremely long time to train the generators and discriminators locally, thus requiring the most computational costs among these data synthesis methods, nearly twice more than HFMDS-FL.
Instead of training a network, our proposed FMDS-FL and HFMDS-FL utilize a one-on-one feature-matching objective function to optimize the synthetic samples directly, thus substantially decreasing the training costs compared with the GAN-based data-augmented methods.</p>

FMDS-FL and HFMDS-FL achieve significantly faster convergence rates compared with the baselines.
Although FedGAN converges faster than other baselines by incorporating the synthetic data at the beginning,
our proposed FMDS-FL and HFMDS-FL algorithms achieve faster convergence rates after the 20-th communication round.
This is because the data synthesis process is conducted every 20 communication rounds in these settings and thus the synthetic data are used for regulating the local training from the 20-th communication round, which indicates that the synthetic data generated by FMDS-FL and HFMDS-FL have remarkably higher quality than the synthetic data of other baselines and thus improve the performance when they are used for training.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we addressed the data statistical heterogeneity challenge in FL by proposing a novel hard feature matching data synthesis (HFMDS) method based on model inversion techniques.
We optimized the synthetic data to be task-relevant and privacy-preserving by matching the class-relevant features of real data.
A hard feature augmentation mechanism that pushes the real features towards the decision boundary was further proposed to preserve data privacy while improving accuracy.
By integrating the proposed HFMDS with FL, we provided a novel FL framework named HFMDS-FL with data augmentation to solve the non-IID issue.
The theoretical analysis demonstrated that the generated synthetic data boost feature alignment across clients and lead to smaller generalization error bound in FL.
Furthermore, the extensive experiments showed that HFMDS-FL consistently outperforms the baselines in accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational costs.
For future work, it is worth investigating how to employ pre-trained generative models for data synthesis in FL to further improve the performance.</p>
