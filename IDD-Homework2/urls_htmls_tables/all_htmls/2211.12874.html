<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">Android malware attacks are increasing daily at a tremendous volume, making Android users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Researchers have developed many machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and mitigate android malware attacks. However, due to technological advancement, there is a rise in android mobile devices. Furthermore, the devices are geographically dispersed, resulting in distributed data. In such scenario, traditional ML/DL techniques are infeasible since all of these approaches require the data to be kept in a central system; this may provide a problem for user privacy because of the massive proliferation of Android mobile devices; putting the data in a central system creates an overhead. Also, the traditional ML/DL-based android malware classification techniques are not scalable. Researchers have proposed federated learning (FL) based android malware classification system to solve the privacy preservation and scalability with high classification performance. In traditional FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is utilized to construct the global model at each round by merging all of the local models obtained from all of the customers that participated in the FL. However, the conventional FedAvg has a disadvantage: if one poor-performing local model is included in global model development for each round, it may result in an under-performing global model. Because FedAvg favors all local models equally when averaging. To address this issue, our main objective in this work is to design a dynamic weighted federated averaging (DW-FedAvg) strategy in which the weights for each local model are automatically updated based on their performance at the client. The DW-FedAvg is evaluated using four popular benchmark datasets, Melgenome, Drebin, Kronodroid and Tuandromd used in android malware classification research. The results show that our proposed approach is scalable, privacy preserved, and capable of outperforming the traditional FedAvg for android malware classification in terms of accuracy, F1 score, AUC score and FPR score.</p>

Also, the threats (android malware) in the android operating system have increased at a rapid rate. It has been found that the share of android malware is higher than 46% among all types of mobile malwares and 400% increase in android-based malware since 2010 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Malware is a type of malicious software that targets the mobile devices running on android operating system. Android devices now have new features for installing and using apps compared to traditional computers. Because of this new feature there is a chance that the android device become vulnerable to android malwares <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and it could be even difficult to safe guard the devices properly from the malwares.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated cybersecurity is one of the newest and emerging approach in malware detection and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. It makes the detection of cyber threats more secure and also use the IoT network system efficiently. This paper focuses on a detailed study of federated models for cybersecurity and machine learning by dividing them into two parts. The first one describes the FL and how it can be applied in cybersecurity for IoT and the second part addresses cybersecurity for FL. This survey mainly focuses on security approaches and also give importance to performance issues related to FL. Security attacks and preventive measures are summarized and also performance issues in FL for IoT networks are also described proficiently. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, authors have proposed a federated-learning (FL) architecture along with android malware detection algorithm, known as Fed-IIoT. This architecture consists of two parts, first one is participant side, where the data has been triggered by two dynamic poisoning attacks based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and federated GAN; and the second one is server side, which monitors the global model and gives a shape to the robust collaboration training model. This model proposes to avoid anomaly in aggregation by a GAN network defense algorithm to detect the vulnerabilities in the server side and also adjusts and adapts Byzantine defense algorithm on Krum and Medium to increase its effectiveness. By using Fed-IIoT, devices can safely communicate with each other with no privacy issues. These features are employed to classify different malwares by using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Similar kind of research found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, where a new technique called permission maps is developed, which provides combined information of android permissions and their severity levels. The training phase of the Perm-Maps is supported by a federated architecture. A CNN model then is employed to classify different malware families. At last, a feature selection approach is applied to reduce the computational effort and CNN training processes. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has developed LiM (’Less is More’), which is a malware classification framework that uses federated learning to detect and categorise dangerous programmes by protecting the privacy of others. LiM employs a safe semi-supervised ensemble learning and FL that maximises malware classification accuracy. Researchers have proposed federated learning based approaches for android malware classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In traditional FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is utilized to construct the global model at each round by merging all of the local models obtained from all of the customers that participated in the FL.

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At each round of FL, a global model is created by averaging (Federated Averaging (FedAvg)) all of the local models received from all of the clients that participated in the FL. However, the traditional FedAvg has a drawback: such as if one poor-performing local model is included in global model construction for each round, it might result in an under-performing global model. Because FedAvg prioritizes all local models equally while averaging. In this scenario, we can use the weighted averaging approach, in which a weight is assigned to each of the local models. The weight assigned to each local model is very challenging because it’s done by trial and error and the overall performance depends on the weight assignment. So, to solve this problem, in this paper, our main motivation is to develop a dynamic weighted federated averaging (DW-FedAvg) approach where the weights for each local model are adjusted automatically based on their performance at the client.
The FedAvg is performed at global server based on the following Eq: <a href="#S3.E1" title="In 3.1 Proposed Approach ‣ 3 Materials and Methods ‣ A Dynamic Weighted Federated Learning for Android Malware Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> as follows:</p>

To do so, the global server first consider each local model has equal powerful, hence equal priority. The global server creates the a global priority index matrix which contains the weights corresponding to each local models. Then the weights are adjusted automatically based on the local models performance. The dynamic weight changes are based on the following condition:</p>

The selection of layers is done by trail-error approach because there is approach to set it automatically. In hidden layers ReLU is the activation function and in the output layer sigmoid is the activation function. In the output layer sigmoid being the activation function is because we have considered binary classification (Benign or Malware). For training the neural network we have used Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer because its popularly used in federated approach.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the Malgenome dataset our proposed DW-FedAvg approach has shown almost similar score or greater score in all aspect (accuracy, F1 score, auc score and FPR score) compare to the traditional FedAvg approach. In the first comparison <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Results, Analysis and Discussion ‣ A Dynamic Weighted Federated Learning for Android Malware Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, (where no. of rounds is 10) there are 5 clients. Our proposed DW-FedAvg approach provides an increased accuracy and F1 score of 0.02% and an increased auc score of 0.05% and a decreased FPR score of 0.21% than the FedAvg approach for those first 5 clients. For 10 clients, it gives almost similar accuracy, F1 score and auc score as that of FedAvg approach, whereas the FPR score has been increased to 0.93%. Likewise for 15 clients, it gives a slight decrease or almost similar accuuracy, F1 score and auc score as that of FedAvg approach, whereas the FPR score has been increased to 0.48%. Similarly for round 20 <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4 Results, Analysis and Discussion ‣ A Dynamic Weighted Federated Learning for Android Malware Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is also tested among 5, 10 and 20 clients.

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The FedAvg approach takes the average of the local models. Our DW-FedAvg approach adjusts the weight based on the model performance. Our approach rewards best performing models whereas penalizes the poor performing models. In case of too many local models with poor classifiers, our DW-FedAvg approach dynamically penalizes weights based on their performance, and thus minimum number of models are getting rewarded. Therefore, the dynamic average overall decreases the accuracy of the model. On the other hand, traditional FedAvg performs average on the local models and does not dynamically adjust the weights of the local models, thus it does not have any effect on accuracy degradation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional FedAvg approach, simple averaging of the local models is done, and it results into a global model. Thus, equal priority is given to all the models. On the other hand, our DW-FedAvg approach dynamically adjusts the weight of the local models based on their performance. Our approach penalizes the poor performing classifiers, whereas rewards the best performing classifiers. By doing the simple average can create a bad global model for the fact that if a global model performs poorly. Our approach prioritizes the best performing models. As more priority is given to better performing models, the global model gives a better result in the accuracy of our approach.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a dynamic weighted federated averaging (DW-FedAvg) approach where the weights for each local model are adjusted automatically based on their performance at the client to create a powerful global model in federated learning based android malware classification. Our proposed DW-FedAvg gives a reward of dynamic weightage to the best performing model and subtract the dynamic weightage from the poor performing local models. The effectiveness of our prooposed approach is evaluated using four benchmark datasets Drebin, Malgenome, Kronodroid and Tuandromd. The results show that our proposed approach has outperformed the traditional FedAvg under different number of clients and different rounds while classifying android malware’s.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a future work, we have plans to work with semi-supervised approach for classifying android malware’s’. We want to integrate our approach on different machine learning algorithms other than CNN such as SVM to create a new approach called Federated SVM. Also, deploying this proposed system into real scenario and examine how will it performs.</p>
