<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a crucial technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that integrates vehicles with the Internet and other entities. The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the Zero-X framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of computing and communication technologies, we are witnessing a growing prevalence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in our modern world. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology provides a crucial communication framework for CAVs, facilitating reliable communication between CAVs and other IoV entities, such as infrastructure, pedestrians, and smart devices. The fifth generation (5G) and the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) networks promise to revolutionize the IoV by enabling ultra-reliability with ultra-low latency and high bandwidth communications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the growing level of connectivity and complexity in the IoV, cybersecurity risks have become a major concern. Among these risks, Zero-day cyberattacks stand out as a significant threat. A zero-day attack refers to a new type of cyber attack that is unknown to both the general public and the cybersecurity experts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This kind of attack exploits unknown vulnerabilities or uses innovative methods to evade detection by security mechanisms. Upstream <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, a cybersecurity and data management platform for CAVs has analyzed over 900 publicly reported cyberattacks on cars in the last decade. Examples of real-world cyberattacks can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, including instances where hackers could disable the brakes and kill a car’s engine traveling at 65 mph using a laptop and custom-written software plugged into the OBD II port. In another case, hackers remotely controlled a Jeep’s engine while driving on a highway. These incidents highlight the significant cybersecurity risks associated with IoV and the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to ensure the safety of vehicle occupants and other road users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate cyberattacks in the context of the IoV, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial tool for cybersecurity. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based IDSs have been proposed to protect vehicular networks from cyber-attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In ML, classification involves assigning data to predefined categories based on their features, using a trained model. This model, developed with a labeled dataset, learns to recognize patterns indicative of each class for predicting unlabeled data. In a real IoV environment, zero-day attacks will inevitably occur frequently. However, existing IDSs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are typically designed for static and closed-set scenarios. Assuming that all possible attack types an intrusion can belong to are known and predefined during the training phase of the IDS. However, this assumption is unrealistic as new types of attacks are constantly emerging. The majority of current IDSs rely on Supervised Learning (SL), a method that can prove to be inefficient in effectively identifying unknown attacks characterized by patterns substantially divergent from those observed during the training phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To enable the detection of zero-day attacks, anomaly and novelty detection techniques have been used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Although the solutions based on these techniques yield promising results in detecting unseen/ zero-day attacks, they can unfortunately not recognize the type of detected attacks. This poses a substantial challenge in the development of a security mechanism capable of identifying known (N-day) attacks while also detecting emerging zero-day (0-day) attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Open-Set Recognition (OSR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> offers a realistic approach in a dynamic field like intrusion detection. This method equips models to manage both known and unexpected attack types, considering the limitations of incomplete training data and the possibility of encountering new attack types after training. OSR emphasizes the need for classifiers to be both accurate and flexible, adapting to scenarios where test samples may include previously unseen attack types. This adaptability is crucial for effectively responding to the continuously evolving nature of such fields. In recent years, combining deep neural networks with open-set recognition has led to significant advances in detecting unknown classes in computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, this approach has yet to be fully utilized in intrusion detection. While some studies have explored the application of open-set recognition in this context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, to the best of our knowledge, OSR has never been leveraged to detect 0-day attacks in IoV.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Recent IDSs  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> leveraged the potential of Federated Leaning (FL) paradigm to train the detection model in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner. FL enables collaborative training of the model without requiring the transmission of raw data, which enhances participants’ data privacy. Due to centralized model aggregation, however, standard FL is susceptible to server failures and external attacks, which can result in inaccurate detection model updates or training failures.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To address the limitations mentioned in existing IDSs within the IoV environment, this paper introduces the Zero-X framework. This security framework effectively identifies both 0-day and N-day attacks by integrating deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a pioneering scheme that utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate secure and decentralized federated training of the Zero-X framework. The framework not only guarantees high accuracy but also ensures fast detection, which is a critical factor in mitigating the impact of attacks. The Zero-X framework is designed to detect and classify attacks solely based on network traffic. Its device-agnostic nature makes it suitable for deployment on both CAVs and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure. Its purpose is to secure CAVs against inter-vehicular attacks while protecting the MEC infrastructure from possible attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, that may originate from compromised CAVs.

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The aforementioned FL-based IDSs operate under the assumption that CAVs possess labeled datasets for FL rounds, an assumption that might be unrealistic due to the general absence of pre-labeled malicious traffic data. Additionally, these systems often assume an IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) configuration for classifier training, which may not reflect the significant imbalances in real-world training data, a known factor adversely affecting collaborative detection performance. Moreover, their dependence on closed-set and supervised learning methods limits the detection of unseen and zero-day attacks. In contrast, our framework employs a more realistic configuration, recognizing that CAVs typically do not have traffic labeling functions and considering the case of non-IID training data. Additionally, Zero-X enhances attack detection, including zero-day attacks, by integrating deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR) capabilities.</span></p>

When a CAV drives near a BS, it can download and read the last block of the blockchain to get the latest global AD model. Acting as FL workers, each CAV conducts the learning process using its own On Board Unit. The CAV trains the global model on its local data and adds a specific amount of Gaussian noise to the trained parameters before sending them back to the BS. This technique, known as differential privacy, protects the privacy of CAV’s native data from honest-but-curious MEC nodes.</span></p>

As a worker, the MEC trains the AC model using its local dataset, which includes labeled malicious network flows. Given that SOCs are equipped with cyber threat intelligence tools, it is reasonable to assume that they possess labeled samples of malicious network traffic. As a validator, the MEC ensures the accuracy of transactions and validates blocks that are proposed by miners. Finally, as a miner, the MEC is responsible for creating new blocks during the consensus process.</span></p>

Conversely, any attack on the CAV’s system would inevitably alter its communication pattern. Hence, we use a Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) to model the expected communication pattern of the CAV and detect any attacks as anomalous occurrences.

In our framework, updates of both models are recorded on the same blockchain, while their training is performed independently. Integrating blockchain with FL requires careful selection of the blockchain type and consensus protocol, as they significantly impact scalability, latency, complexity, and cost. Public blockchains face issues like scalability limitations and high latency. Private blockchains improve scalability and latency but may reduce decentralization and privacy. Consortium blockchains, which Zero-X employs, strike a balance, making them well-suited for our system. Zero-X utilizes a consortium blockchain featuring a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Accuracy (PoA). This mechanism ensures secure sharing and aggregation of model updates. Our approach strategically prioritizes scalability, latency, and security, with a slight compromise in decentralization. We consider two types of nodes within the blockchain network:</span></p>

We also test various time-window (TW) sizes as it directly impacts the detection delay. Further, we will comprehensively analyze the identification performance of N-day and 0-day attacks. We then evaluate the performance of the blockchain system, and present the incentive mechanism’s performance. Next, we present a security analysis of the Zero-X framework.

Specifically, as the TW decreases, both performance metrics deteriorate. The default window size, which corresponds to the flow lifetime, yields the highest accuracy and F1-score. However, if a smaller window size is desired, the 10-second window remains the best option as it still maintains a high level of accuracy and F1-score. The 1-second window, on the other hand, performs the poorest among the tested windows, with an accuracy of 83.16% and an F1-score of 88.15%. Nevertheless, it still provides satisfactory detection capabilities. Ultimately, the choice of TW will depend on the desired level of security when deploying the framework, including considerations such as the tolerance for false negatives and the acceptable detection delay.</span></p>

For the 5G-NIDD dataset, the AC model achieved high performance, with precision and TPR scores of 100% in most cases. The FPR was also low, indicating that the model did not classify benign traffic as malicious. However, for SlowrateDoS and TCPConnectScan attacks with Non-IID data distribution, the F1-score was slightly lower compared to other cases. The slow nature of traffic makes it challenging to detect the Slowrate DoS attack, which differs from other DoS attacks in terms of speed and packet volume sent. In a TCPConnectScan attack, the three-way handshake process is successfully established, mimicking a legitimate connection and making the attack challenging to detect. However, it is worth noting that the detection rate for this type of attacks remains very high, with a detection rate of over 95%. For the VDoS dataset, the AC model achieved a perfect score in all cases with both IID and Non-IID data distributions.</span></p>

In addition, the accuracy and AUROC are 3.5% and 6.94% better, respectively, in the IID setting. However, the TNR for ICMP flood and TCPConnectScan attacks are similar in both IID and Non-IID settings. Interestingly, the Non-IID setting outperforms the IID setting in the case of SYNFlood and UDPScan attacks. Overall, the AC model demonstrates promising performance in both Non-IID and IID settings. The Non-IID configuration is more challenging but, simultaneously, more representative of the real-world scenario where participating MECs (SOCs) may not have the same distribution of attack samples.</span></p>

In this experiment, we consider implementing this framework in Luxembourg as a case study. To comprehensively assess the system’s performance, we plan to deploy a certain number of MEC servers, ranging from 40 to 160, at key base stations across each of Luxembourg’s 12 administrative cantons. Considering the nature of our consortium blockchain, which is comprised of MEC nodes, the experiment includes varying the number of these nodes to examine scalability. We have configured the number of validators to be 10% of the MEC nodes, while ensuring compliance with the PoA requirement of having </span><math id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3f+1" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mn mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">3</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">f</mi></mrow><mo mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><mn mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><plus id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></plus><apply id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><times id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">3</cn><ci id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑓</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1c">3f+1</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S5.SS6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> validators, where </span><math id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">f</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑓</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS6.p1.2.m2.1c">f</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S5.SS6.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> signifies the maximum number of potentially faulty MECs.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Since CAVs operate as passive nodes, their increasing numbers do not influence the transaction volume per block due to the MEC nodes’ role in aggregating AD model updates from the CAVs. Consequently, the addition of CAVs also does not impact consensus time, as they are not participants in the consensus mechanism. Given that each MEC is capable of serving an average of 500 participating CAVs, our system is projected to sustain its performance levels even with a network comprising approximately 120 MECs and 60,000 CAVs. The system’s design ensures that the expansion in node count does not detract from blockchain performance, which affirms the system’s scalability.</span></p>

These attacks impair the target CAV’s ability to process legitimate traffic. For a greater impact, these malicious CAVs, including compromised CAVs part of an IoV botnet, may also target the MEC infrastructure. In this case, the CAVs begin their attack by scanning the MEC server, followed by executing flood-type DDoS attacks through open ports. For both these attack vectors, Zero-X’s ’Attack Detector’ plays a pivotal role. It employs reconstruction error as an anomaly score to identify malicious traffic flows, whether in inter-CAV communications or targeting the MEC system. Our study conducted tests on three types of DoS attacks in inter-vehicular scenarios and five types in the context of MEC infrastructure, in both N-day and 0-day scenarios. The effectiveness of Zero-X is consistently demonstrated in these tests, as shown in Tables </span><a href="#S5.T5" title="Table V ‣ V-D Detection delay ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Zero-X: A Blockchain-Enabled Open-Set Federated Learning Framework for Zero-Day Attack Detection in IoV" class="ltx_ref" style="color:#000000;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a><span id="S5.I2.i1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> and </span><a href="#S5.T6" title="Table VI ‣ V-E1 N-day attack identification performances ‣ V-E Attack identification performance ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Zero-X: A Blockchain-Enabled Open-Set Federated Learning Framework for Zero-Day Attack Detection in IoV" class="ltx_ref" style="color:#000000;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a><span id="S5.I2.i1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">.

Once identified, packets from malicious CAVs are systematically rejected, ensuring the integrity and security of the IoV network.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">This paper proposed Zero-X, a novel security framework designed to detect both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of the IoV. The framework uses a blockchain-enabled federated training approach to build detection and identification models that enable secure collaboration and trust between CAV and MEC nodes. We empirically evaluate the proposed framework and compare its performance with existing IDS using recent publicly available datasets. The results show that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing IDS, demonstrating its superiority in detecting a wide range of cyberattacks. For our future work, we plan to develop a security framework with the ability to detect zero-day attacks, as well as evolve its detection capabilities. This system will incrementally update the detection model to convert newly discovered ”unknown” attacks into ”known” attacks. Another direction to extend this work is to integrate an intrusion response mechanism where multiple reinforcement learning agents are running on a set of vehicular edge nodes and learn to mitigate newly discovered attacks.</span></p>
