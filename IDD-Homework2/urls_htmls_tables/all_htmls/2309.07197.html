<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy.
This approach avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device.
Once the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications, adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye getting misclassified by the local model.
These adversarial images are then later presented to a victim node’s counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs (patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine its robustness.
<span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft adversarial samples.
<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> masks inside the TEE the first part of the back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the malicious samples.
We evaluate <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> on state-of-the-art accurate models using three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.
We show the effectiveness of <span id="id2.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini &amp; Wagner attack. In particular, <span id="id2.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of edge devices and small-scale local servers available off-the-shelf nowadays generated an astonishing trove of data, to be used in several areas, including smart homes, e-health, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\etc</span>.
For several of these scenarios, the data being generated is highly sensitive.
While the deployment of data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms to train models over such data is becoming prevalent, one must take special care to prevent privacy leaks.
In fact, it has been shown how, without proper mitigation mechanisms, sensitive data (<span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>the one used by such ML during training) can be reconstructed.
To overcome this problem, an increasingly popular approach is federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
FL is a decentralized machine learning paradigm, where clients share with a trusted server only their local individual updates, rather than the data used to train it, hence protecting by design the privacy of user data.
The trusted FL server is known by all nodes.
His role is to build a global model by aggregating the updates sent by the nodes.
Once aggregated, the server broadcasts back the updated model to all clients.
The nodes will update their models locally and use the following updates with a fresh batch of local data (<span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>for inference purposes).
This approach prevents user-data from leaving the user devices, as only the local model updates are sent outside the device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A popular model trained in FL is the transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, a widespread multi-purpose deep learning (DL) architecture. Transformers create a rich and high-performing continuous representation of the whole input (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>text or images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>), effectively used across a diverse range of tasks, yielding state-of-the-art results in several areas, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>language modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, audio classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, computer vision tasks such as image classification with vision transformer models (ViT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\etc</span>.
They harness the <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">self-attention mechanism</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
which weights the relative positions of tokens inside a single input sequence to compute a representation of that given sequence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL training context, both the fine tuning of transformer-based models pre-trained on large-scale data and the training of their lightweight counterparts such as MobileViT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
have sparked interest in industry and academia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Because this family of models demands considerable efforts in design and computing resources, protecting its integrity during a collaborative training requires special attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Consider now the following conjectured scenario.
A server broadcasts its expensive model to collaborating clients to have it finetuned over their local private data.
One of the clients taps into its RAM, copies the model and computes malicious patches, specifically designed to trick the model. Without ever altering the model, he can now run a patch attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>: he puts adversarial stickers on objects (roadsigns for instance) that are subject to regular inferences by the FL model: the objects are then misclassified by unaware agents running the collaboratively learned model and an accident may ensue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Alternatively, the malicious agent initiates a poisoning attack that can break a model’s robustness by sending the central server updates that stem from inference on samples engineered with a trojan trigger to create an unsuspected backdoor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> that can be activated at an inconvenient time by unaware users of the FL model.
Similarly, malicious clients can have the model purposefully and repeatedly misclassify their newfound adversarial examples to severely undermine the quality of the aggregated updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In all these scenarios, the malicious client accessing its own physical copy of the model allowed him to generate poisonous data that effectively compromised the FL model’s reliability.
Safeguarding against the creation of these adversaries is paramount in a framework where scaling amplifies the effectiveness of attacks to alarming levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we focus on a client crafting adversarial examples. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts our considered FL scenario with a compromised node which tries to craft adversarial samples (<span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>launching an evasion attack).
Because it is the hardest to defend against, we consider the <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">white-box</em> setting, <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>the model’s characteristics are completely known, and an attacker can leverage gradient computation inside the model to craft adversarial examples.
For instance, in the case of vision classification, an attacker leverages the model’s gradients to craft images designed to fool a classifier while appearing seemingly unaltered to humans, launching a so-called gradient-based <em id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adversarial</em> (or <em id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">evasion</em>) <em id="S1.p6.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">attack</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>While we use Vision Transformers for illustration and description purposes, the mitigation mechanisms presented and implemented later are directly applicable to other classes of models including DNNs or Transformers, such as those for NLP, audio processing, <span id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\etc</span>.</span></span></span>
By design of the FL paradigm, a large number of compromised client can probe their own device memory to launch an adversarial attack against the FL model. In a white-box scenario, these attacks exploit the model in clear at inference time, by perturbing the input and having it misclassified. Such perturbations are typically an additive mask crafted by following the collected gradients of the loss <em id="S1.p6.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">w.r.t</em> the input pixels and applying it to the input signal. Such gradients are either directly obtained by tapping into the device’s memory when they are effectively computed for local usage or they can be calculated knowing model weights and activations when the device is instructed not to produce them (this is typically the case when running inferences after deployment).</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span>: it is a defense that mitigates gradient-based adversarial attacks launched by a client node by leveraging hardware obfuscation at inference time to hide a few in-memory values, <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>those close to the input and produced by the model during each pass.
This leaves the attackers unable to complete the chain-rule of the back-propagation algorithm used by gradient-based attacks and compute the perturbation to update his adversarial sample.
To this end, we rely on hardware-enabled trusted execution environments (TEE), by means of enclaves, secure areas of a processor offering privacy and integrity guarantees.
Notable examples include Intel SGX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> or Arm TrustZone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
TEEs can lead to a restriced white-box scenario, <span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>, a stricter setting in which the attacker cannot access absolutely everything from the model he seeks to defeat,
hence impairing his white-box attack protocols designed for the looser hypothesis.
In our context, we deal specifically with TrustZone, given its vast adoption, performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and support for attestation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
However, TrustZone enclaves have limited memory (up to 30 MB in some scenarios), making it challenging to completely shield the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures often larger than 500 MB. This constraint therefore calls for such a hardware defense to be a light, partial obfuscation of the model.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A significant body of work exists towards defending against adversarial attacks in a white-box context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Because of its few-constraints hypothesis, particular endeavour is directed towards refining adversarial training (AT) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
However, recent studies show a trade-off between a model’s generalization capabilities (<span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>, its standard test accuracy) and its robust accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
AT can also expose the model to new threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and, perhaps even more remarkably, increase robust error at times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
It is possible to use AT at training time as a defense in the federated learning context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> but it creates its own sensitive exposure to a potentially malicious server.
The latter can restore a feature vector that is tightly approximated when the probability assigned to the ground-truth class is low (which is the case for an adversarial example) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
Thus, the server may reconstruct adversarial samples of its client nodes, successfully allowing for privacy breach through an <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">inversion attack</em>, <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>, reconstructing elements of private data in other nodes’ devices.
Surprisingly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> also uses randomisation at inference time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> to defend against iterative gradient-based adversarial attacks, even though much earlier work expresses worrying reserves about such practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, where privacy of the users is paramount, defending against inversion is not on par with the security of the model in itself and attempts at bridging the two are ongoing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
These attempts focus on defending the model at training time or against <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">poisoning</em>, <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>, altering the model’s parameters to have it underperfom in its primary task or overperform in a secondary task unbeknownst to the server or the nodes.
On the other hand, defenses against inversion attacks have seen a surge since the introduction of FL.
DarkneTZ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, PPFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> and GradSec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> mitigate these attacks with the use of a TEE.
By protecting sensitive parameters, activations and gradients inside the enclave memory, the risk of gradient leakage is alleviated and the white-box setting is effectively limited, thus weakening the threat.
However, <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> is conceptually different from these methods, as it does not consider the gradient of the loss with respect to the <em id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">parameters</em>, but with respect to the <em id="S2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">input image</em> instead.
The former can be revealing private training data samples in the course of an inversion attack, while the latter only ever directs the perturbation applied to an input when conducting an adversarial attack.
Other enclave-based defenses do not focus on adversarial attacks, are based on SGX (meaning looser enclave constraints) and do not deal with ML computational graphs in general <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, yet present defense architectures of layers that fit our case <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
Where those were tested only for CNN-based architectures or simple DNNs, <span id="S2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> can protect a larger, more accurate Transformer-based architecture.
The robustness of the two types against adversarial attacks was compared in prior studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, authors mitigate inference time evasion attacks by pairing the distributed model with a node-specific <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">attractor</em>, which detects adversarial perturbations, before distributing it.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> assumes the nodes only have black-box access to their local model.
Given the current limitations on the size of encrypted memory in particular for TrustZone enclaves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, it is currently unfeasible to completely shield models such as VGG-16 or larger.
This is why <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> aims at exploring a more reasonable use case of the hardware obfuscation features of TrustZone by shielding only a subset of the total layers, as we detail more later.
It could thus be used as an overlay to the aforementioned study. More generally, our proposed defense scheme does not interfere with existing software solutions for train time or inference time defenses such as randomization, quantization or encoding techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.
As a result, <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> should not be regarded as a competitor algorithm when it comes to obfuscating sensitive gradients but rather as a supplementary hardware-reliant aid to existing protocols.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, gradient obfuscations as a defense mechanism against evasion attacks have been studied in the past <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
Authors discuss from a theoretical perspective the fragility of relying on masking techniques.
Instead, we show that it fares well protecting a state-of-the-art architecture against inference time gradient-based evasion attacks even by using off-the-shelf hardware with limited resources.
We further elaborate on the strong ties to the Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> in §<a href="#S4" title="IV Design ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. While we show that <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> unambiguously weakens a malicious agent in the white-box setting by restricting their lever of performance, its design provides no defense capabilities against black-box attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> since they operate in a setting that already assumes complete obfuscation of the model’s quantities for crafting the adversarial samples.</p>

Although this attack makes a fundamental pitfall of gradient masking techniques, it is worth noting this step becomes increasingly difficult for the attacker as larger parts of the model are hidden from him since it would suppose he has training resources equivalent to that of the FL system.

An ensemble of models consists of two or more models that determine the correct output through a decision policy.
We chose an ensemble because, generally, when dealing with the image classification task, adversarial examples do not <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">transfer</span> well between attention based and CNN based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
This means that an example crafted to fool one type of model in particular will rarely defeat the other, thus highly benefiting the astuteness of the ensemble.
This allows for mitigating attacks that target either one of the two specifically, by exploiting a combination of the model outputs to maximize chances of correct prediction.
In this paper, we use random selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> as a decision policy, where, for each sample, one of the two models is selected at random to evaluate the input at test time.</p>

To simulate the shielding inside the TEE enclave, we deprive the attacker of the aforementioned quantities (§<a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Pelta shielding ‣ IV Design ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>) during the individual attacks (<a href="#S5.SS1.SSS1" title="V-A1 Individual defenders ‣ V-A Evaluation Metric and Ensemble Defense Setup ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span>1</span></a>) and during the attack against the ensemble (<a href="#S5.SS1.SSS2" title="V-A2 Ensemble defender ‣ V-A Evaluation Metric and Ensemble Defense Setup ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span>2</span></a>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever attempt at mitigating the recent Self-Attention Gradient Attack (see <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Attacker Setup ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a>). Against the ensemble, the attacker is deprived of the sensitive quantities of the two models separately, then jointly.
For the ViT models, all transforms up to the position embedding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are included.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the Big Transfer (BiT) models, the scheme includes the first weight-standardized convolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> and its following padding operation. For the ResNets, the first convolution, batch normalization and ReLU activation are masked.
Notice that, for all three model types, we obfuscate either two learnable transformations or a non-invertible parametric transformation like weight-standardization, ReLU or MaxPool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, so the attacker cannot retrieve the obfuscated quantities without uncertainty.

Assuming the most resource-intensive case where gradients are produced, the shielding of the ensemble requires less than 16 MB of TEE memory at the very worst, consistent with what typical TrustZone-enabled devices allow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

This automated scheme allows for an exploration phase and an exploitation phase where an objective function (commonly the cross-entropy loss) is maximized.
This attack includes other mechanisms like the ability to restart at a best point along the search. In the benchmark of the individual models, APGD is the most recent attack and it would also be considered the most sophisticated.</p>

This process, called <span id="S5.SS2.p11.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">transposed convolution</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, essentially is a geometrical transformation applied to the vector gradient at the backward pass of a convolutional layer.
Although this method does not offer any guarantee of convergence towards a successful adversarial example, it allows to understand whether the adjoint can still serve as a last resort when no priors on the shielded parts are available under limited resource constraint. Individual models are attacked in a similar manner, replacing gradient terms of the shielded computations of the defender by gradients of a substitute transposed convolution.
We will therefore ask: in the absence of the shielded quantities, <em id="S5.SS2.p11.2.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">does upsampling constitute a last resort for the attacker?</em></p>

The ensemble model is evaluated against the SAGA in four settings: no model is shielded, only the BiT model is shielded, only the ViT model is shielded, both models are shielded (maximum protection for the ensemble).
For reference, the clean accuracy of the models over 1000 random samples from the validation set of each dataset is provided.

It can be noted that, generally, the size of the model has a positive influence on the astuteness after shielding across attacks; however, this effect seems largely overwhelmed by the advantage variants of ViT have over CNN-based models before and after shielding.
Additionally, we see that for the ensemble defense, individual model robust accuracies are not equally protected: the ViT model benefits more from <span id="S5.SS3.p3.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> when applied only to it than BiT.
We explain these results as a general advantage in robustness of Transformer-based architectures over CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> with BiT being more sensitive to targeted attacks than its counterpart, and also more sensitive to adversarial examples crafted against the ViT. We further note that in the ensemble, individual robust accuracies worsen compared to the non-shielded setting when only their counterpart is shielded.
The reason for this is attributed to the fact that SAGA solely directs the sample towards augmenting the non-shielded loss, while disregarding the shielded loss, consequently resulting in the creation of adversarial samples that exclusively aim to exploit vulnerabilities in the non-shielded model.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As previously mentioned, TEEs typically operate in a secure mode that is designed to provide protection against external attacks. This secure mode can add overhead and complexity to communication between the secure world and the rest of the system, which can in turn impact data throughput. For example, when data is transferred between the TEE and the non-secure world, it may need to be encrypted and decrypted, which can slow down communication. Data transferred between the secure world and the TEE traditionally requires secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access or tampering, thus hindering the velocity of the data transfer process, as encryption and decryption may be necessary to protect the data. Moreover, a context switch is typically required to move from one execution context to another. This context switching can introduce additional overhead and slow down the data transfer process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> is designed to hide sensitive data at inference time through the use of a TEE, a throughput bottleneck could be felt at two stages of the federated endeavour. The first case is the most self-explanatory: even after deployment following FL rounds, inference with <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> still supposes parts of the model are inside a TEE and sensitive operations are carried inside the enclave. This requires context switches and establishing a secure communication channel between worlds to either feed the first computation nodes of the model with the input data or extracting the output of the last shielded layer to carry on subsequent operations with the clear and deeper segment of the model. Fortunately, these elementary TEE methods usually range from microseconds up to milliseconds at most for either SGX or TrustZone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>, which is commensurate with the real-time usage of most current edge ML applications that fit into FL (text prediction, sentiment analysis, health monitoring, speech recognition etc.) as recently demonstrated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. As a rule, it should be kept in mind that minimizing context switches is an important optimization technique in the design of TEE applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second case is the training phase of the FL scheme. During this phase, the use of an optimization algorithm puts more strain on the TEE and its communication channels. For instance, inside the enclave, gradients which were not generated during regular end-user inference are now being computed: these gradients seldom need to be read from within the enclave in order to be sent for aggregation, which adds in bandwidth overhead. However, many of these limitations are taken into account when tuning the parameters of the protocol for each FL round. For example, the frequency at which the weight updates are pulled out of the enclave to be sent to the aggregating server could be lowered to allow averaging hidden gradients over larger batches on the client nodes. Overall, training protocols of an FL scheme are expected to harness the idle state of edge devices to handle intermittent compute node availability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. The extra bandwidth overhead of the second case should therefore not impact user experience as much as it does the strategy of the FL training rounds.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, adversarial attacks are the basis of several trojaning and poisoning attacks. However, they are difficult to defend against at inference time under the white-box hypothesis, which is the default setting in FL.
We described how to mitigate such attacks by using hardware obfuscation to sidestep the white-box. We introduce a novel defense, <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span>: a lightweight shielding method which relies on TrustZone enclaves to mask few carefully chosen parameters and gradients against iterative gradient-based attacks.
Our evaluation shows promising results, sensibly mitigating the effectiveness of state-of-the-art attacks. To the best of our knowledge, <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> also constitute the first attempt at defending against the Self-Attention Gradient Attack.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We intend to extend this work along the following directions.
Because the use of enclaves calls for somewhat costly normal-world to secure-world communication mechanisms, properly evaluating the speed of each collaborating device under our shielding scheme is needed on top of considering the aforementioned memory overheads (Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-A2 Ensemble defender ‣ V-A Evaluation Metric and Ensemble Defense Setup ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted Execution Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>) in order to assess the influence of <span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> on the FL training’s practical performance.
Additionally, a natural extension to this work is to apply <span id="S7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Pelta</span> along with existing software defenses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> to assess their combined benefits against a sophisticated attacker.</p>
