<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows a set of clients to collaboratively train a machine-learning model without exposing local training samples. In this context, it is considered to be privacy-preserving and hence has been adopted by medical centers to train machine-learning models over private data.
However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named MediLeak that enables a malicious parameter server to recover high-fidelity patient images from the model updates uploaded by the clients. MediLeak requires the server to generate an adversarial model by adding a crafted module in front of the original model architecture. It is published to the clients in the regular FL training process and each client conducts local training on it to generate corresponding model updates. Then, based on the FL protocol, the model updates are sent back to the server and our proposed analytical method recovers private data from the parameter updates of the crafted module. We provide a comprehensive analysis for MediLeak and show that it can successfully break the state-of-the-art cryptographic secure aggregation protocols, designed to protect the FL systems from privacy inference attacks.
We implement MediLeak on the MedMNIST and COVIDx CXR-4 datasets. The results show that MediLeak can nearly perfectly recover private images with high recovery rates and quantitative scores. We further perform downstream tasks such as disease classification with the recovered data, where our results show no significant performance degradation compared to using the original training samples.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a key enabling technology for the future implementation of AI-empowered medical diagnosis and treatment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. FL allows medical centers to collaboratively train machine-learning models for various clinical tasks such as abnormality detection and disease classification, without sharing private patient information. This is very important because medical centers are bound to preserve patient privacy and their data usage is strictly restricted in many clinical applications.
Under the FL framework, distributed training is set up in a way where hospitals that own private clinical data usually serve as clients, and a server – either hosted at one of the collaborating sites or maintained by a third party, integrates the model updates received from each client to orchestrate the federated learning paradigm. There are multiple open sources (such as NVFLARE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and OpenFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>) as well as commercial platforms (such as Rhino FCP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), designed to streamline the implementation of FL. During the FL training process, only the model updates, which refer to either the gradients or parameter updates, are exchanged between the participant and the server, and all the private training samples are kept locally at the clinical site. Therefore, when first introduced, federated learning was considered to be privacy-preserving and the model updates are regarded as safe vectors that hide training samples’ private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">However, recent privacy attacks challenge this intuition as they demonstrate that a curious or malicious parameter server can extract useful information about the training samples such as their labels, membership information, and even training sample themselves from the model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Of particular interest, the model inversion attacks (MIAs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> are a type of privacy attack aiming to recover the original training images.
They take the individual model updates provided by the clients as inputs and reverse them back to the local training images. This could be detrimental in radiologic applications, where such an attack can reconstruct patient-specific data. Existing MIAs usually formulate this reverse process as an optimization problem and can achieve good recovery performance to recover high-fidelity training images from the model updates, when undergoing enough optimization iterations, which completely exposes the information that the FL system wants to protect. Fortunately, as the arms race between the attacker and defender goes on, a specialized multi-party computation (MPC) mechanism named secure aggregation (SA) protocol is proposed to prevent MIAs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. The fundamental idea of SA protocols is to use various cryptography primitives (e.g., secret sharing) to mask the individual model updates with random values but keep their summation identical to the pre-masked value so that the FL system can proceed to the training process without exposing individual model updates. As a result, the SA protocol prevents the MIAs from even obtaining the inputs (individual model updates) to the reverse processes, and the privacy of the FL systems is guaranteed. Moreover, existing MIAs are also facing scalability and efficiency challenges, as in practice they need the server to consume extensive resources (usually hundreds of seconds) to recover only a few images, making them hardly employable in real systems.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Our Attack</h4>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel attack name MediLeak that addresses the limitation of the existing works, making it a very practical attack and representing a privacy vulnerability of the FL systems. MediLeak can recover hundreds of training samples in a batch from the victim client simultaneously within a few seconds.
MediLeak can also break the secure aggregation protocols as it can recover the training samples directly from the summation value of the model updates even though the individual ones are cryptographically masked.
Technically, MediLeak is a two-phase attack including the attack preparation phase and the sample recovery phase. In the first phase, the attacker adds an additional two-linear layer module in front of the original model architecture and initializes the module with customized parameters before sending it to the clients.
For the target victim, the attacker initializes the parameters of the two-layer module to form a “linear leakage” module with the help of an auxiliary dataset that has the same data format and distribution as the training samples. This “linear leakage” module is a powerful mathematical tool that can perfectly reverse its gradients back to its inputs, which are identical to the training samples because we place this module as the first component of the model architecture. For other clients, their two-layer modules’ parameters are crafted to form a “zero gradient” module, aiming to zero out their gradients and model updates. By doing so the aggregated model update is identical to the model update of the victim because all others are set to zero, rendering the SA protocols useless.</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We implement MediLeak on the MedMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and COVIDx CXR-4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> datasets and evaluate our attack performance using the recovery rate, structural similarity (SSIM) score, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) score, and attack time. The results show that MediLeak achieves excellent performance on both datasets to recover hundreds of images simultaneously with high recovery rates and quantitative scores, with only a few seconds of execution time. We visualize the recovered images and they are visually indistinguishable from the original images.
We compare the performance of MediLeak with three existing MIAs. The results demonstrate that MediLeak achieves better quantitative scores and is much more efficient than them.
We further feed the recovered images to downstream disease diagnosis tasks. Our results show that the recovered images achieve classification performance close to the original ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.</p>

To solve this optimization problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> utilizes the L-BFGS optimizer to reconstruct the dummy samples iteratively step by step until reaching a good optimization point. It is further improved by an analytical method that aims to recover the ground-truth labels of dummy samples from the gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which significantly eases the optimization task and helps accomplish better attack performance. Later works improve the optimization tools and focus on recovering larger batches of images on more practical machine learning models such as the ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. However, their recovery sizes are still restricted to the scale of tens, representing a scalability challenge. Moreover, all the aforementioned MIAs require costly iterative optimization methods in their design, which unfortunately, introduce a very large overhead to recover each batch of input images. These methods also cannot bypass the current SA protocols.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Secure Aggregation under Challenge:</span> Under the honest-but-curious attack model, the SA protocols have proven to be secure against various MIAs. However, recent works adopt a stronger attack model to assume a <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">proactive</span> attacker that modifies the global model’s parameters and even its architecture before publishing it to the clients. Under this assumption, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposes a novel attack that retrieves a target individual model update from the aggregated result that breaks the SA protocols. The fundamental idea of this novel attack is to craft the model parameters to adversarial models and distribute different adversarial models to different clients strategically. The adversarial models are crafted to ensure that only the model update of the victim client is preserved while all the others are zeroed out. The limitation of this attack is that it incorporates a costly optimization process in its design, which introduces too much attack overheads.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes another attack method to add crafted modules before the original model architecture. These additional modules are crafted with delicate mathematical designs to ensure that the model gradients can be perfectly reversed back to inputs whenever the server receives any model updates.
The limitation of this attack is that the attacker cannot link the recovered images to their owners, which means the SA protocols still preserve a certain level of privacy, known as “privacy by shuffling”.</p>

We can observe that both the recovery rate (i.e. the ratio of successfully recovered images) and the quantitative scores (i.e. the PSNR and SSIM scores) decrease when the recovered batch size increases. This is expected because the larger the recovery batch size, the more difficult the recovery task to conduct.

Particularly, the SSIM scores (ranging from 0 to 1) remain to be 0.99 for all settings, because of the recovery excellency. This can be further verified by the recovered samples we visualized in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Attack Preparation: ‣ IV-B Detailed Attack Flow ‣ IV Attack Method ‣ Harvesting Private Medical Images in Federated Learning Systems with Crafted Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, in which we plot the original images in the first row and the recovered ones in the second. We find that the recovered images are of high quality and cannot be visually distinguished from the original ones, even for some detailed small marks and notations. In Tab. <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Harvesting Private Medical Images in Federated Learning Systems with Crafted Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> we also demonstrate the attack time (in seconds). We find that the attack time is monotonically increasing with respect to the recovery batch size. For the largest batch size (i.e. 500 images) over the complex COVIDx CXR-4 dataset, it only takes the attacker less than 10 seconds to fulfill the recovery task, indicating that MediLeak is very effective.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare MediLeak’s attack performance with three optimization-based model inversion attacks (MIAs) including the DLG/iDLG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, InvertGradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and GradInversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> attacks (denoted as DLG, Invert, and GradInvert respectively) over the MedMNIST dataset for one small batch of input images. We compare the PSNR scores, SSIM scores, and the attack time between the three attacks and our work. The results are demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Harvesting Private Medical Images in Federated Learning Systems with Crafted Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. We can find that our attack achieves much better PSNR scores and SSIM scores than the existing MIAs, indicating that our attack can reconstruct samples with better quality. At the same time, our attack consumes significantly less time than the current MIAs. Particularly, the existing attacks consume a few hundred seconds to reconstruct one batch of samples, while our attack only requires less than one second, which reduces the current cost by two orders of magnitude. The reason why our attack is much more efficient is that our attack only involves closed-form mathematical calculations while the other three attacks require costly iterative-based optimization methods. However, there is no free lunch and we clarify that the three benchmark works adopt an honest-but-curious attack model, which does not allow the attacker to modify the model parameters and architecture as we did.</p>

We use the state-of-the-art vision transformer model (ViT-S) (embedding size=368, number of heads=6, 22M parameters) pre-trained by self-supervised learning (SSL) technique on 30k COVIDx CXR-3 samples and fine-tuned on the RSNA-RICORD part of the dataset to perform the classification task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and evaluate it on the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset. We demonstrate the performance in Tab.<a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-A Experimental Settings: ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Harvesting Private Medical Images in Federated Learning Systems with Crafted Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. We use widely used machine learning metrics to evaluate the classification performance and we find that the recovered images achieve nearly the same performance as the original ones.
This shows that our reconstruction process is highly successful in keeping all semantic meaning within the images and the reconstructed images can be used to perform any potential clinical analysis, which further indicates the severity of the privacy threat imposed by our attack. We consider it a very practical attack scenario for a curious party, which either can be the medical federated learning’s participants or a third-party service provider (who provides the necessary platform, computation resource, and other FL infrastructures) to launch our attack to first reconstruct the sensitive medical images and then feed them to certain downstream analysis tasks to obtain further information about of the victims.</p>

The dataset is used in the attack preparation phase for estimating essential attack parameters before crafting the “zero gradient” and “’linear leakage’ modules. In the ideal case, the auxiliary dataset shall have the same data distribution as the target victim’s local dataset or the auxiliary dataset is more representative. It may be a challenge for the general vision tasks to find such a representative auxiliary dataset. However, for the medical images, this does not pose a barrier because the medical images such as the CT scanning images of humans are fixed to have the same data format and similar common features. The attacker can easily obtain representative datasets released for research purposes on the Internet. Moreover, because the attacker is a participant in the FL system, we consider he may even collude with others to obtain this auxiliary dataset.</p>

However, we argue that the attacker can boost his attack scalability performance to launch MediLeak in multiple or continuous FL training rounds. In this way, the attacker can “harvest” the local training samples of a single or even multiple clients continuously to obtain more sensitive data samples. The recovery rate of certain images in the local datasets will also increase, as they may eventually be reconstructed during the continuous multi-round attacks even though they escape the recovery process of a single round.</p>

However, we argue that our attack can be launched in the initial training rounds or even just the first training round to preserve attack stealthiness. This is because in the initial training rounds, everything is randomly initialized and it is difficult for the defender to distinguish the malicious behaviors from randomly initialized benign patterns.</p>

But we notice that the other formats of medical records such as tabular and human language data also contain a huge amount of sensitive and private information. In practice, these records usually involve more detailed personal information such as the patient’s name, address, phone number, and health conditions.
We consider the privacy issue of these data records, particularly whether these records can be reconstructed and exposed to a malicious party when they are used in a federated learning system as a very important security and privacy problem. We consider our method to provide a fundamental idea and attack flow about how to recover sensitive client-owned records from the aggregated model updates. However, we acknowledge that such a complex reconstruction problem involving multi-modality data records is non-trivial and deserves a lot of efforts. We leave this as the future direction of our work.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present MediLeak–a powerful MIA that breaks the privacy-preserving feature of the current secure federated learning systems protected by the state-of-the-art SA protocols by accurately and efficiently recovering local training samples owned by the clients, resulting in a complete exposure of the patient’s private information. Our attack requires the attacker to first modify the global model architecture and initialize it to form different adversarial modules before publishing it to the clients. Then according to normal FL procedure, the clients train the received global model with their local datasets to provide model updates for the server. Upon recipient, we devise an efficient analytical method to reverse the collected aggregated model updates back to the local training samples without relying upon any costly optimization methods. We implement our attack on two practical medical image datasets and evaluate the attack performance under different settings. The experiment results demonstrate that our attack achieves excellent reconstruction performance, and outperforms the existing optimization-based MIAs.
Our attack represents a practical vulnerability of the current medical FL systems, making the community rethink the privacy guarantee of the current systems, and calling for effective defense against such kinds of advanced MIAs.</p>
