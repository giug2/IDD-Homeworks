<p id="1.1" class="ltx_p">The dramatic success of deep learning is largely due to the availability of data. Data samples are often acquired on edge devices, such as smart phones, vehicles and sensors, and in some cases cannot be shared due to privacy considerations.
Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm for training models across multiple edge devices holding local datasets, without explicitly exchanging the data.
Learning in a federated manner differs from conventional centralized machine learning, and poses several core unique challenges and requirements, which are closely related to classical problems studied in the areas of signal processing and communications.
Consequently, dedicated schemes derived from these areas are expected to play an important role in the success of federated learning and the transition of deep learning from the domain of centralized servers to mobile edge devices.
In this article, we provide a unified systematic framework for federated learning in a manner that encapsulates and highlights the main challenges that are natural to treat using signal processing tools.
We present a formulation for the federated learning paradigm from a signal processing perspective, and survey a set of candidate approaches for tackling its unique challenges. We further provide guidelines for the design and adaptation of signal processing and communication methods to facilitate federated learning at large scale.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning has led to breakthroughs in various fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. As machine learning methods, and particularly those based on <span title="deep neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long-plural">deep neural networks</span></span>, are data-driven, their success hinges on vast amounts of training data. This data is commonly generated at edge devices, such as mobile phones, sensors, vehicles, and medical devices.
In the traditional cloud-centric approach, data collected by mobile devices is uploaded and processed centrally at a cloud-based server or data center. As datasets, such as images and text messages, often contain private information, uploading them may be undesirable due to privacy and locality concerns. Furthermore, sharing massive datasets can result in a substantial burden on the communication links between the edge devices and the server.
These difficulties can be tackled by exploiting the available computational resources of edge devices via mobile edge computing, in order to carry out training at network edges without having to share the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
An emerging paradigm for enabling learning at the edge is <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span>, which features distributed learning with centralized aggregations, orchestrated by an edge server (or multiple edge servers) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Federated learning is the focus of a growing research attention over the last few years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In such systems, learning from distributed data and communicating between the server and the devices are two critical and coupled aspects, and their fusion poses many new research challenges which are not encountered in traditional centralized deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is based on an iterative training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. At each federated learning iteration, the edge devices train a local model using their possibly private data, and transmit the updated model to the central server. The server aggregates the received updates into a single global model, and sends its parameters back to the edge devices. Therefore, to implement federated learning, edge devices only need to exchange their trained model parameters, avoiding the need to share their private data.
This property of federated learning makes it a promising solution for applications which are comprised of multiple entities that are required to learn from data, while operating under strict privacy practices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Federated learning, originally proposed by researchers from Google AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, has been applied to improve next-word prediction models in Google’s Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, allowing a multitude of smartphones to participate in training without requiring users to share their possibly private text messages.
It has since been considered as an enabler technology for learning in applications with strict privacy considerations, such as models trained on healthcare data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>; highly distributed technologies, such as smart manufacturing systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; and learning over challenging communication networks, such as underwater <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and unmanned aerial vehicle networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Learning in a federated manner is subject to several key challenges that are not encountered in conventional cloud-centric learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
These challenges include the communication bottleneck arising from the
need for a large number of users to repeatedly and concurrently communicate their intermediate learned models, which are typically high dimensional, during the learning procedure; the heterogeneity of the participating devices in terms of storage, computation capabilities, and energy states, as well as the quantity and distribution of their local data; and privacy and security considerations following from, e.g., the possible presence of malicious users interfering with the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The challenges encountered in federated learning affect the optimization performance and the accuracy of the learned model. They also introduce unique design considerations, such as communication burden and privacy guarantees, which arise from its distributed nature.
Moreover, federated learning adds potentially more hyperparameters to the optimization problem. These include separate tuning of the aggregation/global model update rule, number of edge devices selected per round, number of local steps per round, configuration of update compression algorithms, and more. These add to the existing numerous hyperparameters used in conventional deep learning, which, when combined with the aforementioned challenges, make the overall implementation and optimization of federated learning systems a difficult task.</p>

Consequently, the derivation of dedicated signal processing schemes is expected to play an important role in the success of federated learning.
In fact, a multitude of federated learning-oriented methods based on established concepts in signal processing and communications have been recently proposed. These include the application of compression and quantization techniques to reduce the volume of the messages exchanged in the federated learning procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>; introducing functional and over-the-air computation tools to facilitate high throughput federated aggregation over shared wireless channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>; and the derivation of federated learning-aware resource allocation schemes to allow reliable communication between the participating entities during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

To that aim, we discuss how the federated learning paradigm can be viewed from a signal processing perspective, dividing its flow into three main steps: model distributing, local training, and global aggregation. We then focus on the global aggregation step, which involves conveying the local model updates from the users to the central server.

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The repeated exchange of updated models between the users and the server often involves massive transmissions over rate-limited communication channels. This challenge is particularly relevant when the model being trained is a <abbr title="deep neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">DNN</span></abbr> comprised of a large amount of trainable parameters, as well as for federated learning carried out over shared and resource-limited wireless networks, e.g., when the users are wireless edge devices.
In addition to overloading the communication infrastructure, these repeated transmissions imply that the time required to tune the global model depends not only on the number of training iterations, but also on the delay induced by transmitting the model updates at each federated learning iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Federated learning networks are potentially comprised of a massive number of energy-constrained edge users communicating over the wireless media. Considering the limited capacity of wireless channels, the communications of the model updates can be slower than local computations by orders of magnitude. Hence, the communication bottleneck directly affects the training time of global models trained in a federated manner, which in turn may degrade their resulting accuracy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Statistical heterogeneity implies that the data generating distributions vary between different sets of users. This is typically the case in federated learning, as the data available at each user device is likely to be personalized towards the specific user.
Statistical heterogeneity implies that when training several instances of a model on multiple edge devices, each instance may be biased. As a result, the conventional strategy based on averaging the trained updates may not reflect the intended usage of the global model in inference.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As federated learning involves a multitude of user devices, their behavior and availability can be quite diverse. This form of heterogeneity, referred to as <span id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">behavior heterogeneity</span>, can affect the learning process that relies on the device status. For instance, one may design the federated learning mechanism to involve portable user devices only when they are either idle, charging, or connected to an unmetered network, such as Wi-Fi. As a result, participants may be unreliable and can drop out at any time, leading to uneven participation over the training group. Moreover, as opposed to centralized learning where training is carried out using a computationally powerful server, the participating devices in federated learning vary in terms of hardware specifications like computation and energy resources. For instance, a federated learning network may involve user devices ranging from sophisticated autonomous vehicles to hardware-limited <span title="internet-of-things" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">internet-of-things</span></span> devices. This implies that the duration of the local training procedure can vary considerably between users, resulting in computation bottlenecks and straggler effects which delay the overall convergence of the learned model.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key motivations for federated learning is to preserve privacy with respect to the users’ data. In that sense, federated learning has distinct privacy advantages compared to centralized training on persisted data, as the information conveyed from the users is not the data itself but the model updates obtained using this local data.
However, one must also consider that information can be inferred from the learning process and be traced back to its source in the resulting trained model. For instance, gradients are known to be leaky, and may reveal the data used for computing them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, since the users are outside of the control of the server they may be unreliable, or even malicious, giving rise to security issues. Such users send the server arbitrary or tainted model updates, affecting the trained model, while exploiting the interactiveness of the process to have the opportunity to adapt.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As detailed above, the federated learning procedure is comprised of three main steps: model distributing, local training, and global aggregation. Nonetheless, the unique challenges of federated learning discussed in the previous subsection are mostly associated with the last step of global aggregation. In particular, the distribution step involves the broadcasting of the global model from the server to the users, and thus is far less affected by privacy, security and heterogeneity considerations, compared to the transmission from the users to the server. Furthermore, this broadcasting is carried out over the downlink channel, which is typically less limited in terms of throughput compared to the uplink channel, and thus is less affected by communication limitations compared to the aggregation stage.
The local training step, which yields the updated model based on the previous model and the data, is typically carried out using conventional optimizers, such as <abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr> and its variants. Consequently, the federated learning step in which most challenges arise is during global aggregation.</p>

Here, the aim to allow high throughput and reliable communication in a manner which does not introduce notable delays to the overall learning procedure.
This requires consideration of two main aspects: The first is the allocation of the resources of the channel in terms of bandwidth and transmission time.
A special case of channel resources division is user selection and scheduling, determining the set of participating users in the current round <math id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{G}_{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒢</mi><mi id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝒢</ci><ci id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{G}_{t}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first stage in the global aggregation step of federated learning focuses on the processing of the local outcomes of the training procedure at the users’ side before their transmission.
Here, we describe conventional encoding strategies, and discuss how this operation can be viewed from a signal processing perspective, briefly reviewing related methods applied in a non-learning setting. We then discuss their adaptation to encoding the local updates in federated learning by highlighting the specific design considerations and reviewing some candidate techniques from the recent literature.

In addition, one of the main motivating factors behind federated learning is that the local data at each user does not leave the local device, as only gradients or the model updates computations from each user are shared with the server. However, even exchanging gradients in a raw form can leak information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

Compression is the objective of traditional source coding methods.
Source coding techniques are typically divided into lossless and lossy compression. Lossless compression, such as entropy coding, converts discrete quantities into a reduced-bit representation in a reversible manner. Lossy compression, such as quantization, can be applied also to continuous-valued quantities, and yields a compact digital representation from which the original input can be recovered only up to some error. As model parameters trained in a federated manner, e.g., the weights of <abbr title="deep neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short-plural">DNNs</span></abbr>, are typically treated as continuous-valued quantities during training, we henceforth focus on lossy compression methods. Furthermore, lossy compression allows achieving improved compression rates compared to lossless compression for discrete-valued weights (though at the cost of possible distortion upon recovery). Finally, it is common to combine lossy and lossless compression, e.g., first quantize and then apply entropy coding, as in entropy-constrained quantization.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Source coding techniques also extend to distributed setups, where multiple users encode correlated local sources (e.g., vectors) such that the resulting representations are both compact in terms of number of bits, and can be jointly recovered using a single decoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Existing distributed source coding methods, such as the lossless Slepian-Wolf coding and the lossy Wyner-Ziv coding, typically require the encoders to have some knowledge of the joint statistics of the sources available at each of the users. Distributed source coding methods enable the users to exploit this correlation between the sources to further compress them without compromising the ability to reconstruct the sources from the compressed representations.</p>

While the local encoding stage can be treated as a source coding setup, distributed source coding techniques are typically not suitable for compressing the model updates. This follows mainly from the lack of a known statistical characterization of the joint distribution of the model updates, which is typically exploited by distributed source coding methods. Furthermore, the fact that in federated learning different users are often randomly selected to participate in each round (see “<a href="#S4.SS1" title="In IV Uplink Transmission ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Learning-Aware Resource Allocation</span></span></a>”) and aggregation often involves truncating some of the model updates (see “<a href="#S5.SS2" title="In V Global Combining ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Security-Enhanced Federated Combining</span></span></a>”) makes the application of distributed source coding techniques, which relies on the joint decoding of all the coded representations, quite challenging to implement. Therefore, uplink compression in federated learning is carried out by each user individually in a disjoint manner with the remaining users, and (non-distributed) lossy source coding are typically utilized to achieve highly compressed representation.</p>

Sparsification can be implemented based on the value of the model updates, e.g., by nullifying the model updates of lesser magnitude <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or by encoding each layer into a low rank approximation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. The rationale here is that nullifying the weak parameters is expected to have only a minor effect on the accuracy of the model. Alternatively, one can sparsify the model updates in a random fashion by randomized subsampling and sparifying masks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. The latter strategy relies on the fact that when the masks are randomized in an i.i.d. manner among the users, the global model aggregated via federated averaging will be hardly affected by this sparsification when the number of participating users is sufficiently large.</p>

<p id="S3.I2.i2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Quantization schemes studied in the areas of compression and analog-to-digital-conversion often require knowledge of the distribution of their input to determine which values are mapped to which discrete representation.
This limits their application in federated learning setups.
However, by exploiting dithered (randomized) quantization techniques, federated learning of accurate models can be achieved regardless of the distribution of the model updates, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. This follows since the distortion induced by dithered quantization is statistically uncorrelated with the model updates, and thus its effect is mitigated by the averaging operation carried out by the server. Furthermore, dithered quantization can greatly benefit from having a source of common randomness between the users and server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which is a feasible requirement in federated learning setups, as such a shared random number generator allows implementing subtractive dithered quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A Uplink Compression ‣ III Local Updates Processing and Encoding ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

Although each local update does not explicitly contain the user’s data, the local updates may be used to reveal the data used for computing them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
In general, there are several potential adversaries from which privacy should be preserved in federated learning: the server that may attempt to infer private information using all model updates received; malicious users who can deviate from the protocol execution to achieve information on data held by honest users (see “<a href="#S5.SS2" title="In V Global Combining ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Security-Enhanced Federated Combining</span></span></a>”); and external adversaries that try to access the private data.</p>

A natural strategy to encode the model updates to preserve privacy is to encrypt them.
Encrypting the model updates implies that they cannot be recovered, and thus cannot be traced back to the data, by external adversaries. In order to preserve privacy while also allowing to combine the encrypted model updates into a global model, one can use secure distributed coding mechanisms, also known as multi-party encryption. In particular, the family of additively homomorphic multi-party encryption schemes allow to perform additive calculations, e.g., averaging-based aggregation, on the encrypted data without having to first decrypt it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
The result of the computation is an encrypted form, such that when it is decrypted, the output is the same as if the operations had been performed on the unencrypted data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-party encryption methods require the participating entities to share a secret key. An alternative approach to implement secure encoding without key sharing is by randomly obscuring the source via, e.g., artificial noise. This strategy is widely used in physical layer security mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which are well-studied in the signal processing and communication literature. Here, the noise is typically designed to achieve a vanishing mutual information criterion, known as weak secrecy, at the adversary side, i.e., after it has been transmitted. Encoding by artificial noise can also achieve privacy guarantees which are more powerful than the weak secrecy and are invariant of their transmission, such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The differential privacy level represents how much does the algorithm output change when modifying a single data sample, and thus reflects on the ability to retrace a data sample from the outcome of the training procedure (the exact mathematical formulation of this notion of <math id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\epsilon,\delta)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml">δ</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.3.2"><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2.2">𝛿</ci></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.1.m1.2c">(\epsilon,\delta)</annotation></semantics></math> differential privacy is given in the box on Page <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Privacy Preservation ‣ III Local Updates Processing and Encoding ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>).

Each method is characterized by a different trade-off relevant to the unique federated learning challenges, as discussed in the following:</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The second stage in the global aggregation step of federated learning involves the transmission of the encoded updated models, produced as the outputs of the local encoding stage, to the server.

<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning typically involves a large number of edge users, which often reside in various physical locations, and utilize different infrastructures for communicating with the server. In particular, some of the users may communicate over the same shared channel, e.g., a set of mobile devices served by the same wireless access point, while some can utilize non-shared wireline links, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-C Challenges ‣ II Basics in Federated Learning ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
As we discuss in the sequel, the main challenges associated with the uplink transmission stage arise when the users communicate over a shared medium, e.g., when the users are wireless transceivers served by the same access point. Therefore, to highlight the potential benefits of properly designed uplink transmission schemes, we focus henceforth on the extreme scenario in which all the users communicate with the server over the same wireless channel. Nonetheless, the methods detailed next can be adapted and contribute to federated learning networks where distinct subsets of the users share the uplink channel.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.3" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p4.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Conventional Transmission</span>:
From an implementation perspective, it is often simpler to separate the communication functionality and the learning application. In this case, the learning procedure is agnostic of how the model updates are communicated, while relying on an existing communication architecture to provide these transmissions.
Conventional communication architectures are ignorant of the learning task, and enable multiple users to share the channel by mitigating interference via resource allocation. This is achieved by dividing the channel resources into multiple resource blocks and assigning each block to a different user. A common approach to do so is by splitting the available bandwidth into non-overlapping frequency bins via orthogonal frequency division multiplexing multiple access protocols. Such orthogonlization results in each user having a separate channel with the server, i.e., <math id="S4.p4.1.m1.4" class="ltx_Math"

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While the conventional strategy allows reliable transmission of the model updates from the users to the server, it can induce a notable communication delay. This delay is sometimes more dominant than the duration it takes for each user to carry out its local optimization, thus affecting the convergence of the learned global model. To see this, recall that wireless channels are limited in bandwidth and energy, and thus the achievable rate of each user decays with the number of participating users, as the channel resources are divided among more users. Since the number of devices taking part in the federated learning procedure is typically very large, while the model updates are often comprised of a massive amount of parameters, the delay of each user can be quite significant. Furthermore, the delays may vary considerably between different users due to the heterogeneous nature of edge devices, notably affecting the overall delay of each uplink transmission round, being dictated by the user with the largest delay. As federated learning is comprised of multiple rounds, the conventional strategy is likely to result in lengthy convergence time of the learning procedure, which is translated into a degraded accuracy of models being learned in a given finite time.</p>

Resource allocation is well studied in the signal processing and communication literature, considering various objectives including throughput and energy efficiency. However, unlike conventional communication systems where the receiver is interested in recovering the transmitted messages, in federated learning the server needs the model updates only as an intermediate step in producing the global model. This gives rise to learning-aware resource allocation and transmission schemes, detailed in the following. In particular, we first discuss how the resources of the wireless channels can be divided among the users while accounting for the learning task. Then we present the notion of over-the-air federated learning, allowing the users to share the same resources, i.e., communicate in a non-orthogonal fashion, while treating the effect of the channel as a form of functional network over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The uplink channel is comprised of multiple resource blocks. These blocks represent, e.g., portions of the bandwidth and temporal transmission slots. While dividing these resources equally among all users is likely to limit the convergence rate of the learned global model, one can notably improve the convergence rate by dividing the resources in a manner which accounts for the overall learning procedure.</p>

Allocating the resources in wireless networks with multiple users is comprised of <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user selection</span> and <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource management</span>: The former deals with the selection of the users to whom resources are allocated, i.e., the users which are allowed to transmit; The latter refers to the division of the resources among the selected users. In the conventional signal processing literature on resource allocation, which deals with communications over wireless networks not necessarily for the purpose of training a parametric model, user selection and resource management are commonly studied jointly. Common resource allocation strategies are categorized into static pre-defined allocation and dynamic divisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Leading design tools include optimization-based strategies, which formulate the resource allocation problem using a network utility function, and game-theoretic approaches that utilize a local utility for each user <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. These utility measures typically characterize communication rate, fairness, and energy efficiency. Here, partial participation, i.e., user selection, is obtained as a byproduct of this utility, which may result in some users not utilizing any channel resources.</p>

As opposed to resource allocation in conventional wireless networks, partial user participation is typically desirable in federated learning regardless of the availability of channel resources. As a result, user selection and resource management are often considered as separate tasks, as opposed to the conventional resource allocation literature.</p>

The motivation for user selection stems not only from the communication bottleneck, but also from reasons associated with computation and load balancing. It was noted that increasing the number of participating users beyond some point no longer contributes to the learned model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and that an accuracy similar to that achieved using full device participation can be obtained while having each user participate in a subset of the global aggregation rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. These observations capture the main distinction between the communications problem of uplink transmission, in which the goal is to convey the messages from all the users to the server, to uplink transmission in federated learning, where messages are useful only if they contribute to the learned global model.</p>

Based on the above considerations, one can mitigate the effect of some of the challenges associated with federated learning by properly selecting the users which participate in each round, and then divide the channel resources among them in a learning-aware manner. While the objectives may differ from those used for conventional resource allocation, one can still utilize existing methods with proper adaption to account for the learning task.
Resource allocation methods for federated learning include:</p>

An alternative non-uniform approach is to use importance sampling to adaptively assign probabilities to users in each round. It was shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> that implementing random user selection via importance sampling based on the users’ computing, communication, and data resources, can notably increase the convergence speed.</p>

<p id="S4.I3.i1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Online scheduling selects the participating users in each round by accounting for the past selected users and their observed behavior, e.g., delay. Such selection policies can be designed by adopting a multi-armed bandit framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Here, the users are selected to strike a balance between the exploitation of users which performed well in the past, e.g., transmitted with low delay, and the exploration of users which have not sufficiently participated until the current round.
For instance, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> assigned each user with an index, which is comprised of the average transmission time of the user based on previous rounds (exploitation term), and a second term which is inversely proportional to the number of rounds the user transmitted (exploration term). The latter ensures that users who have transmitted less are given priority, in order to capture potential environments changes that may reduce their transmission delay.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An alternative strategy for uplink transmissions in federated learning over shared channels, which can be treated as an extreme case of resource management, is to allow full reuse of all the channel resource blocks. Here, the users simultaneously utilize the complete temporal and spectral resources of the uplink channel in a non-orthogonal manner. The rationale is to exploit the inherent aggregation carried out by the shared channel as a form of over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

The concept of over-the-air functional computation originates in coding studies for multiple access channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
It is based on the counter-intuitive finding that interference can be harnessed to help computing, when there is a one-to-one map between a desired computation and a linear function of the transmissions.
Since the emergence of over-the-air functional computation in multi-user communications, it has been traditionally studied and developed for statistical inference in wireless sensor networks.</p>

For the interference result in some desired linear function over a continuous space, such as the averaging of real-valued vectors, the transmitters should utilize analog signalling.

Over-the-air computations can notably increase the throughput and reduce the transmission delay in federated learning over wireless channels compared with orthogonal division of the channel resources. However, analog signalling induces challenges on the communication methods; For instance, it requires accurate synchronization among all users. Furthermore, in order for the users and the server to guarantee that the combining carried out by the shared channel can be transformed into a desired aggregation mapping, knowledge of the channel input-output relationship is typically required.
Consequently, the design of over-the-air computation methods for federated learning must account for the following considerations:</p>

<div id="S4.I4.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.I4.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The desired global combining mapping should be one which can be obtained via over-the-air computations. In particular, for linear uplink channel models where the contribution of the interference is additive, this implies that the desired aggregation mapping should be a nomographic function.
Such multivariate functions can be represented as a univariate functional of a combination of their variables, as is the case for FedAvg aggregation (<a href="#S2.E6" title="In II-B Federated Averaging ‣ II Basics in Federated Learning ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>). This limits the combination of over-the-air computation with non-nomographic aggregation rules, such as trimmed mean (see “<a href="#S5.SS2" title="In V Global Combining ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Security-Enhanced Federated Combining</span></span></a>”).</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.2" class="ltx_p">The second consideration should be carefully examined for each model, since the sensitivity of optimization algorithms is highly dependent on their objective. For instance, <abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr>-based optimization over convex objectives is highly affected by noisy observations, where convergence can only be guaranteed to some environment of the optimal solution. However, for non-convex objectives, <abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr> benefits from a minor level of noise, which contributes to its convergence by providing means of avoiding local minimas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
To deal with the third requirement, one can incorporate mechanisms utilized in digital communication protocols, which typically use beacon transmissions and slotted superframes to achieve synchronization. An alternative approach to achieve synchronization is to utilize dedicated schemes designed for over-the-air computations. These include the analog modulation method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, or the broadcasting of a shared cloak during the model distributing step as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.</p>

This implies that ensuring accuracy in the sense of minimizing the global loss may result in a combined model that is unable to accurately infer samples drawn from the distributions under which it was trained.
In addition, conventional strategies assume that the information sent by the users is reliable, ignoring possible adversaries that can harm the results.
Straight-forward weighted aggregation of the users’ updates can be arbitrarily skewed by a single Byzantine-faulty user via, e.g., poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, the application of statistical estimation techniques for global combining is challenging due to some of the properties of federated learning setups. First, while estimation methods often rely on prior knowledge of the joint distribution of the observations and the desired quantity, one rarely has a access to a reliable characterization of the statistical relationship between the observations and the desired global model. In fact, it is quite unlikely to assume that the server knows the distribution of the model updates. Furthermore, the global objective in (<a href="#S2.E3" title="In II-A Federated Learning Flow ‣ II Basics in Federated Learning ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) relies on data and is computed using the datasets available at the users, implying that the server cannot even evaluate the global objective for a given model, let alone optimize its combining rule based on it. Moreover, as discussed earlier, even when the server can characterize a combining rule which yields model that minimizes global objective (<a href="#S2.E3" title="In II-A Federated Learning Flow ‣ II Basics in Federated Learning ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), the resulting model may in fact be inaccurate to a large family of relevant distributions. Finally, the server should also be able to cope with unreliable users; a requirement which is not typically encountered in statistical estimation.</p>

Using a combination of inference rules rather than a single aggregated model allows utilizing tools from multi-source adaptation, ensemble learning, and mixture-of-experts, to determine how to combine the models. The main challenge associated with this strategy is that a separate model has to be maintained and trained for each user/cluster of users. This increases the volume of the resulting global model, which is comprised of an ensemble of individual models rather than a single aggregated one, and implies that the model distributing step over the downlink should be carried out in a multicast fashion, as different models are distributed to different users, rather than via conventional broadcasting. An example of a mechanism for combining the inference rules rather than the model parameters is detailed as <span id="S5.I2.i2.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Mixture of Models</span> on Page <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Federated Combining ‣ V Global Combining ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Aggregating the parameters into a single model allows all the users to train the same model. Combining the inference rules is oriented towards scenarios in which inference is carried out at the server side, which has access to all the models. Nonetheless, one can still combine diverse inference rules on the edge via collaboration, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, at the cost of additional communications during inference.</p>

true ones (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> for the exact statement of the difference).
This indicates that one can achieve arbitrarily small global loss for the individual distributions observed at each cluster in ”test” time.
Another insight arising from the result is that the individual cluster loss is directly related to the richness of its model.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fact that many different users take part in federated learning gives rise to security issues which are not commonly encountered in conventional centralized learning.
In particular, model updates sent by some users can be unreliable and significantly deviate from their normal values, either unintentionally or maliciously. This in turn induces bias on the learned model, and may severely degrade the convergence performance.</p>

Distributed robust learning is concerned with samples containing a mixture of authentic samples and outliers held by a central server. The authentic samples are generated according to an underlying model (i.e., ground truth), and the outliers may be arbitrarily corrupted or even maliciously chosen.
Such robust aggregation methods are typically non-affine, and are designed not to be affected by the values of the extreme (and possibly unreliable) samples.
A common way to reduce the effect of the malicious outliers on the learned model is to use the geometric median in the aggregation procedure instead of the simple averaging. The geometric median is a generalization of median in one-dimension to multiple dimensions. It aggregates a collection of independent estimates into a single estimate with significantly stronger concentration properties, even in presence of a constant fraction of outliers in the collection.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Design Considerations</span>:
For a federated learning aggregation method to be Byzantine fault tolerant, it must not be affected by abnormal model updates, which correspond to unreliable users.
A key challenge which arises in Byzantine-robust federated combining stems from the fact that the aggregation technique should not only mitigate the effect of abnormal updates values, but also do so in a way that does not significantly impair the optimization performance, and without inducing additional significant communications between the users and the server.
Thus, an important question in this setting is what levels of accuracy should one expect when training a model in a federated manner while being Byzantine-robust, and how to design algorithms that improve the accuracy.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, the design of Byzantine-robust federated combining methods must account for the following consideration:</p>

<p id="S5.I3.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The heterogeneous nature of the users must be accounted for when boosting Byzantine fault tolerance. Specifically, not only are the users outside the control of the server, but also data may not be homogeneous between users, and different users possess different amount of data. Thus, a relatively large level of diversity, which is typically used in Byzantine-robust distributed optimization as measure of abnormality, is in fact expected in federated learning, even when all the users are reliable.</p>

The method of geometric median can be further generalized to marginal median and to “mean around median” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. When used for aggregating the model updates, median-based aggregation guarantees that the difference in the global model is in the proximity of at least half the considered updates, which yields resiliency to abnormal updates. Such robust aggregation does not require knowledge on the fraction of unreliable users.</p>

We follow the division of the global aggregation step used in the article; discussing future research directions related to the users’ local updates encoding, after which we elaborate on those focusing on the transmission of the encoded model updates and their combining on the server side. Finally, we discuss additional future directions which go beyond this division.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Processing of the updated models produced by the local optimization procedure allows to tackle some of the core challenges of federated learning. As discussed in the “<a href="#S3" title="In Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Local Updates Processing and Encoding</span></span></a>” section, by encoding the model updates prior to their transmission, one can notably relieve the communication burden via, e.g., quantization and compression, as well as boost privacy preservation using encryption and differential privacy techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The potential of learning-aware local encoding in facilitating federated learning at a large scale gives rise to a multitude of possible research directions. Most studies to date on uplink compression focus on a single user, assuming that all users in the network utilize the same encoding mechanism. Nonetheless, the heterogeneous nature of federated learning motivates treating the need to compress the model updates from a perspective of the overall distributed system. For instance, one would expect users of different technologies to utilize different quantization resolution, as for each device it is expected to be translated into communication delay in a different manner. Furthermore, it may be preferable to change the compression mapping as the learning procedure progresses, using different resolutions at distinct communication rounds, aiming to minimize the overall communication burden. Finally, for users with datasets of similar distributions, the model updates may be statistically correlated, indicating the possibility to exploit this correlation to further reduce the communication load via, e.g., distributed source coding techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the fact that model updates are often compressed in a manner which induces distortion motivates the analysis of lossy compression as a privacy preserving mechanism. In particular, differential privacy amplification methods rely on adding artificial distortion to the model updates, where the motivation is to obscure them such that each single data sample used in their training cannot be recovered. Since quantization and lossy compression already induces some level of distortion, one can reduce the level of artificial noise needed to guarantee differential privacy. Furthermore, the fact that quantization discretizes the model updates facilitates applying encryption methods, which often assume integer quantities.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main challenge in uplink transmission stems from the fact that communications is often carried out over shared noisy channels which are limited in their spectral and temporal resources. As discussed in the “<a href="#S4" title="In Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Uplink Transmission</span></span></a>” section, the delay induced by communications and its harmful effect on the convergence time and on the accuracy of the model learned in a federated manner can be significantly reduced by dividing the channel resources in learning-aware fashion. For instance, by boosting interference-free orthogonal communications while prioritizing users which are expected to have a greater contribution to the learning process, and even by promoting full reuse via over-the-air computation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, there is still much to be explored in the study of uplink transmission schemes for federated learning. In particular, while user selection methods give all users the chance to participate, the prioritization among the users should account for a multitude of considerations, which are not accounted for to date. For instance, the fact that edge devices are comprised of a broad range of different technologies indicates that some devices are more likely to transmit at increased delays. Statistical heterogeneity also plays an important role, particularly when one has prior knowledge on the distribution of each user as in clustered federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>; Here, one should consider whether it is preferable to assign resources and select users in a diverse or homogeneous fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, resource allocation and user selection can also contribute to non-orthogonal transmissions. Here, it is possible to rely on dynamic spectrum access schemes, commonly studied for wireless sensor networks. Developing dynamic spectrum access strategies to federating learning tasks is subject to challenges which are not encountered in its traditional domains. For instance, intriguing research questions are: (i) How to develop dynamic spectrum access that integrates over-the-air and orthogonal transmissions when coherent over-the-air transmission over the entire network is not efficient; and (ii) How to develop spatio-temporal dynamic spectrum access strategies when users experience deep fading in time and frequency. For example, a promising direction is to model the fading channel as a known or unknown Markovian process, for which theoretical performance measures for channel allocation strategies can be developed rigorously as in, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we note that the vast majority of the existing federated learning algorithms focus on communications carried out over networks obeying a star topology, in which all users communicate directly with the server. Nevertheless, common communication schemes in wireless networks allow multi-hop communications between edge devices, either via wireless access points, relays, or even using the emerging technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. In such cases, different subsets of the users may share distinct channels, while communications on both the uplink and the downlink is carried out over a multi-hop route. Learning in a federated manner over hierarchical communication networks requires a dedicated treatment regarding the division of channel resources, the presence of intermediate aggregations, and the possibilities of model caching along the routes as well as of carrying out over-the-air federated learning in a hierarchical manner.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Global combining refers to how the channel output observed by the server orchestrating the federated learning procedure is translated into an updated global model. As discussed in the “<a href="#S5" title="In Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Global Combining</span></span></a>” section, applying combining mechanisms other than the conventional federated averaging rule (<a href="#S2.E6" title="In II-B Federated Averaging ‣ II Basics in Federated Learning ‣ Federated Learning: A Signal Processing Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) allows to compensate for distortions induced in encoding and transmission of the model updates, mitigate the harmful effect of unreliable and malicious users, and facilitate accurate inference in the presence of heterogeneous data division.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The fact that most non-secure combining mechanisms for tackling heterogeneity rely on weighted averaging motivates exploring non-linear combinations. Such an analysis can be combined with Byzantine-robust aggregation, which inherently utilizes non-linear mappings to omit outliers, exploring the joint functionality in training a model capable of accurately inferring using each of the individual distributions used for its training, possibly yielding personalized models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, while being tolerant to the presence of malicious users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of the data and the users in federated learning systems implies that mechanisms for truncating the contribution of unreliable users must account for such properties. One approach to do so is to divide the users into clusters based on their distribution and implement Byzantine-robust aggregation separately over each of these homogeneous clusters, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. The fact that such a strategy already trains multiple models for each cluster motivates its combination with aggregation mechanisms which combine the inference rules during test.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our description so far follows the division of the global aggregation stage in the federated learning flow into the aforementioned encoding, transmission, and combining stages. This structured framework enables identifying the relationships between federated learning schemes derived for different purposes, as well as facilitates the derivation of dedicated future methods. Nonetheless, one is not limited to design mechanisms within this framework, and it is natural to also consider joint optimization of multiple steps. Furthermore, while most of the key challenges of federated learning which are natural to address using signal processing techniques lie in the global aggregation stage, the federated learning flow is also comprised of the model distributing and local training steps. It is thus of interest to extend the scope beyond the aggregation of the model updates into a global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One such research direction involves the joint optimization of the multiple stages of which global aggregation is comprised. For instance, jointly treating the local encoding and uplink transmission stages can be studied as a distributed joint source channel coding setup, possibly minimizing the delay in conveying the overall model updates. In addition, it is likely that one can further benefit in terms of convergence speed by designing such direct mapping from model updates into channel input of the complete set of users in a joint manner with the combining mechanism at the server side.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Additional relevant research directions which go beyond the division considered in this article focus on reducing the communication overload and boosting privacy in the presence of external adversaries during downlink transmission. Another possible direction is to improve the convergence time in the local training stage without modifying the optimization algorithm by properly selecting the data. Here, one can consider choosing a subset of the data used for training via active learning techniques, which dates back to Chernoff’s framework of optimal experimental design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, in order to reduce the training time and thus the overall convergence delay. An intriguing question is thus how to select the useful data among multiple users in the heterogeneous federated learning setting. This will allow significant bandwidth and energy savings by prioritizing informative data sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, while federated learning deals with the training of a machine learning model, its distributed nature also motivates the study of how to use this learned model during inference. For instance, federated learning carried out in a clustered fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> results in different users having access to different diverse models, as well as a centralized server which has access to all these models. In this case, one can consider scenarios in which multiple edge users collaborate in inference as a form of wisdom of the crowds as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, or alternatively, combining server-based inference with localized one to enabled personalized decision making.</p>
