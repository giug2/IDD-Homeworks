<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), an attractive and promising distributed machine learning paradigm, has sparked extensive interest in exploiting tremendous data stored on ubiquitous mobile devices. However, conventional FL suffers severely from resource heterogeneity, as clients with weak computational and communication capability may be unable to complete local training using the same local training hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose Dap-FL, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-assisted adaptive FL system, in which local learning rates and local training epochs are adaptively adjusted by all resource-heterogeneous clients through locally deployed DDPG-assisted adaptive hyper-parameter selection schemes. Particularly, the rationality of the proposed hyper-parameter selection scheme is confirmed through rigorous mathematical proof. Besides, due to the thoughtlessness of security consideration of adaptive FL systems in previous studies, we introduce the Paillier cryptosystem to aggregate local models in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. Rigorous analyses show that the proposed Dap-FL system could guarantee the security of clients’ private local models against chosen-plaintext attacks and chosen-message attacks in a widely used honest-but-curious participants and active adversaries security model. In addition, through ingenious and extensive experiments, the proposed Dap-FL achieves higher global model prediction accuracy and faster convergence rates than conventional FL, and the comprehensiveness of the adjusted local training hyper-parameters is validated. More importantly, experimental results also show that the proposed Dap-FL achieves higher model prediction accuracy than two state-of-the-art RL-assisted FL methods, i.e., 6.03% higher than DDPG-based FL and 7.85% higher than DQN-based FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As estimated by Cisco, nearly 850 zettabytes of data burst out from all people, machines, and things by 2021, up from 220 zettabytes generated in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Coupled with the rise of Machine Learning (ML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and Deep learning (DL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, these valuable data could unfold countless opportunities for modern society, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, Internet of Vehicle (IoV) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and Healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, practical scenarios are somewhat disappointing: utilizing such tremendous data for ML is more difficult than we thought. On the one hand, collecting data for ML model training would eventually saturate WAN bandwidths, while the WAN bandwidth is a scarce resource, whose growth has been decelerating for many years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, data security and privacy are strengthened by states across the world, e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which significantly increases the difficulty of data collection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Facing the above two enormous difficulties, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has emerged as an attractive and promising paradigm, which is in stark contrast to traditional ML with a data center. In the typical FL, clients collaboratively train a global ML model under the orchestration of a central server without collecting local data in a data center. Specifically, clients locally train individual models using their data in parallel, and the central server aggregates local contributions to update the global model subsequently. Such a process is executed periodically until the global model converges. Therefore, FL is a direct application of the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data minimization</span> principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, as it decouples model training from the need for direct access to the raw data, which alleviates the difficulties of communication overhead and privacy. With the primary advantages of communication efficiency and privacy preservation, FL has been deployed in a wide range of applications, including the keyboard application for smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising benefits, FL is still caught in a dilemma between model prediction performance and system efficiency in practice. Such a dilemma is mainly caused by <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource heterogeneity</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where clients have diverse local resources for computation and communication. When enforcing these resource-heterogeneous clients to train local models using the same hyper-parameters, some clients cannot complete the local training due to insufficient local resources, thereby leading to a serious <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">straggler problem</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Dropping straggler clients not only reduces the global model convergence rate but also reduces the global model prediction performance, although the system efficiency is guaranteed in some ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. On the contrary, waiting for straggler clients blindly significantly wastes lots of time, although the global model prediction accuracy may increase due to the extra local contributions. To meet the requirements of the model prediction performance and the system efficiency simultaneously, the FL system should carefully manipulate the local training, which is referred to as <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adaptive or self-tuning algorithms</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The adaptive hyper-parameter adjustment has a long history <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, but it mainly focuses on model prediction accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> rather than communication and computational efficacy for heterogeneous clients or the system. In FL, more potential hyper-parameters are adaptively adjusted, e.g., participating clients or the amount of participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, local training iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, frequency of aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and allocated resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In a nutshell, current adaptive FL methods usually take one of two routes (the details are shown in Section VII): (1) theoretic methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and (2) Reinforcement Leaning (RL)-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Both the two routes formulate the hyper-parameter adjusting process in FL as a constrained and non-convex optimization problem, which is hard to solve directly. The former route converts the prime optimization problem into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved easier, by making some prior hypotheses to practical environment constraints. However, such transformations with prior hypotheses may be less reasonable, as real-world environments, e.g., wireless communication ranges and battery power, are time-varying and have no statistical regularity to follow. Recently, the RL-based method is proposed as a slightly more sophisticated but more effective and practical method to achieve adaptive FL, which formulates the hyper-parameter adjusting process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and searches for appropriate hyper-parameters by introducing the Deep-Q Network (DQN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> or the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> algorithm on the server side. Among them, the aggregation frequency adjustment in Sun <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>’s DQN-based method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and the client selection in Zhang et al.’s DDPG-based method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> are the state-of-the-art RL-based adaptive FL methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, even for <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, existing RL-based adaptive FL methods have five main shortages: (1) DQN is less effective than DDPG when the state and action spaces are continuous and high-dimensional. (2) Selecting clients is equivalent to abandoning straggler clients, which may result in low global model prediction accuracy. (3) Selecting hyper-parameters for clients on the server side is less effective since the server cannot capture clients’ fast-changing training conditions. (4) Fixing the time-varying constraints as a constant is unreasonable. (5) Ignoring security requirements is not conducive to the development of adaptive FL. Therefore, an intuitive question is: <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How to achieve adaptive FL better with the satisfaction of global model performance, efficiency, and security requirements?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In response, we propose a <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">D</span>DPG-assisted <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">a</span>daptive and <span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">p</span>rivacy-preserving federated learning (Dap-FL) system. Specifically, we introduce the DDPG algorithm to help clients adaptively adjust local learning rates and local training epochs for the purpose that all participating clients with heterogeneous resources could collaboratively train a global model efficiently, rather than abandoning straggler clients. In addition, Dap-FL adopts the Paillier cryptosystem for privacy-preserving and secure local model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We stress the superiority of the proposed Dap-FL compared to the RL-based FL designs, especially the state-of-the-art <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, in the following five aspects: (1) Different from selecting clients’ local training hyper-parameters by a server, Dap-FL adaptively adjusts clients’ local training hyper-parameters through DDPG models maintained by the clients themselves, which suits clients’ fast-changing training conditions more. (2) Rather than abandoning straggler clients with low local resources, Dap-FL aggregates all local contributions, which helps FL out of the model prediction accuracy and system efficiency dilemma. (3) Instead of leveraging the global loss function, Dap-FL formulate clients’ local contributions as the reward function, which is validated more effective in our experiments. (4) Dap-FL considers time-varying constraint conditions with respect to clients’ local resources, which is more reasonable and practical than modeling the constraints as a constant. (5) Compared to all RL-based adaptive FL designs without any security concerns, Dap-FL aggregates local models in a secure manner, which makes the proposed Dap-FL competitive. To the best of our knowledge, Dap-FL is the first adaptive FL system by locally adjusting hyper-parameters through the DDPG algorithm, and is the first secure and privacy-preserving adaptive FL system.</p>

Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section IX.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve the goal of adaptively adjusting local training hyper-parameters during the FL process, we must model it mathematically. In the FL under our consideration, every client has heterogeneous and time-varying resource constraints regarding computation and communication, which means clients may adopt totally different hyper-parameters for local training according to diverse resource constraints, thereby making different contributions to the global model. Therefore, it is essential to model the local training process with resource constraints for each client separately.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">But the first question is how the client’s local training hyper-parameters affect the global model convergence. Empirical results show that the convergence of the global model is strongly impacted by local contributions which are dependent on the local training hyper-parameters significantly, i.e., local training epoch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and the local learning rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. In detail, a small local training epoch is more helpful for the precise approximation to the converged global model, but clients would suffer from more aggregations, which decelerates the global model convergence rate and improves clients’ communication consumption. Conversely, a large local training epoch helps the global model converge to an approximate result of the converged global model rapidly, but it makes the final convergence of the global model extremely difficult, since the variance of local models increases sharply. Besides, the local learning rate has a similar impact on the global model to the local training epoch. Although the decaying learning rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> is utilized to adaptively tune models in the ML community, it may prevent the global model from convergence, as the learning rate becomes too small after too many training rounds. As a result, we plan to adaptively adjust the local training epoch and the local learning rate in each training round.</p>

It means that DDPG models could output the best policies to guide the local training of the client. Moreover, we illustrate the actions of the client given by the best policy in each training round in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VII-B Experimental results and evaluation ‣ VII Experiments and Evaluation ‣ Dap-FL: Federated Learning flourishes by adaptive tuning and secure aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

Such a downswing is a little bit similar to an exponential decay of learning rate in the ML community but obviously better, since the local learning rate and local training epoch converge to appropriate values, i.e., <math id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3.9\times 10^{-4}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3.9</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><msup id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="float" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">3.9</cn><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">3.9\times 10^{-4}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">2</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">2</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">2</annotation></semantics></math>, rather than decline without limits, thereby preventing the global model from convergence.</p>

Obviously, the proposed Dap-FL could accelerate the convergence rate of the global model compared to the global model in the <span id="S7.SS2.p2.9.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Small</span> setting, while achieving an accuracy close to the latter one. On the contrary, the final global model in the <span id="S7.SS2.p2.9.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Dap-FL</span> achieves a higher prediction accuracy than the global model in the <span id="S7.SS2.p2.9.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Large</span> setting, although the convergence rate is slightly slower. Note that the final global models even achieve the best prediction accuracy without losing convergence rate in the ML tasks of Logistic on MNIST and CNN on Fashion-MNIST, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VII-B Experimental results and evaluation ‣ VII Experiments and Evaluation ‣ Dap-FL: Federated Learning flourishes by adaptive tuning and secure aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.(e) and (h). To summarize, compared to conventional hyper-parameter-fixed FL, the proposed Dap-FL not only achieves a higher global model prediction accuracy, but also a more rapid global model convergence rate, which significantly reduces the communication overhead of all clients.</p>

Such experimental results illustrate that adaptively adjusting two selected training hyper-parameters in the proposed Dap-FL system is comprehensive in most instances, since merely adjusting one type of local training hyper-parameters cannot obtain global models with high performance.
A possible reason behind the abnormal performance in the ResNet-18 on MNIST task is that the powerful training ability of ResNet-18 benefiting from the residual structure obscures the tuning effect of the proposed Dap-FL system to the global model on such a simple dataset. If changing the dataset to a complex one, such as CIFAR-100, a more significant effect might be present, which remains in future works.</p>

<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL is proposed by Mcmahan <span id="S8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> aiming to train a global model from decentralized data distributed in different clients.

<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adaptive FL </span></p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Since the foundation of FL is ML (or DL), adaptively selecting training hyper-parameters, i.e., adaptive FL, is of crucial importance to the flourish of FL. Existing designs for adaptive FL mainly rely on two major categories: theoretic methods and RL-based methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Adaptive FL based on the theoretic method<span id="S8.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_medium">.</span></span>
Theoretic methods always achieve adaptive FL by formulating the FL process as an optimization problem.
For example, Luo <span id="S8.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> analyze the relationship between the convergence of the global model and the total cost, based on which a biconvex optimization problem with respect to the numbers of local training iterations and client selection is established. The proposed adaptive FL minimize the total cost of learning time and energy consumption while ensuring convergence.
Wu <span id="S8.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose an adaptive weighting algorithm, FedAdp, to accelerate the global model convergence by quantifying participants’ aggregation weights adaptively and jointly.
Wang <span id="S8.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> solve the problem that efficiently utilizing the limited computation and communication resources by dynamically adapting the frequency of aggregation.
Shi <span id="S8.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> design an efficient binary search algorithm to obtain the scheduling policy in terms of the highest achievable global model accuracy under a given training time budget.
Tran <span id="S8.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> formulate the FL problem as a non-convex optimization problem FEDL that captures the trade-off among computation and communication latencies, clients’ energy consumptions, and FL time. By transforming it into three convex sub-problems, they obtain qualitative insights about optimal model accuracy, energy consumption, and learning time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, theoretically optimizing the global model accuracy and convergence rate within time-vary constraints, e.g., variable local computational consumption caused by battery power, is less efficiency. Although they make some prior hypotheses to constraints, it seems not that reasonable, as the practical time-varying constraints usually have no statistical regularity to follow.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Adaptive FL based on the RL method<span id="S8.p7.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_medium">.</span></span> An alternative method to achieve adaptive FL points to RL, as the FL process could be formulated as an MDP.
Wang <span id="S8.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> propose an experience-driven FL framework FAVOR, which speeds up convergence by intelligence selecting clients. Particularly, Deep Q-Network (DQN) is introduced to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds.
Sun <span id="S8.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of FL based on DQN in IIoT, which is characterized by improved learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.
Su <span id="S8.p7.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> deploy DQN on clients to derive their optimal training strategies of local models.
Nguyen <span id="S8.p7.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> propose a double DQN-based scheme to select the optimal communication channel to reduce energy cost during model transmission.
It seems that DQN is an effective method to adaptively adjust local training strategies.
However, DQN is more proper for solving decision-making problems with discrete states and actions, while the state and action space of FL under our consideration are continuous, e.g., the local learning rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Two very recent works introduce DDPG, another DRL method suitable for continuous problems, to achieve adaptive FL.
On the one hand, Zhang <span id="S8.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> adopt DDPG to select clients with low training costs and high model accuracy to improve the rate of model aggregation and reduce the communication cost for IIoT.
On the other hand, Lu <span id="S8.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> leverage DDPG to improve the efficiency of FL, which can select clients with a larger amount of resources of computing and communication capacity.
Nevertheless, selecting a sub-set of participant clients for faster convergence time runs counter to the fact that more clients increase the convergence rate.
In addition, rejecting straggler clients all the time may raise a fairness issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Different from all existing work on adaptive FL, our scheme deploys the DDPG-assisted hyper-parameter selection scheme on every client to adaptively adjust training hyper-parameters locally for the purpose of involving more clients rather than abandoning straggler clients. In this way, all participants could adaptively execute local training according to their time-varying training state by themselves, and the convergence rate of the global model is accelerated. Furthermore, the employment of the Paillier cryptosystem makes the adaptive FL system more privacy-preserving and secure.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Dap-FL is a DDPG-assisted adaptive and privacy-preserving FL system, which guarantees clients with poor resources could participate in FL by adaptively adjusting local training hyper-parameters, and preserves model privacy through a secure aggregation method based on the Paillier cryptosystem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S9.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An interesting experimental result is that the global model prediction accuracy of ResNet-18 on MNIST is not improved with the deployment of the proposed Dap-FL. We guess the possible reason is that the powerful model training capability of the ResNet-18 overshadows the hyper-parameter tuning effect of the proposed Dap-FL, which should be further confirmed in the future. Besides, we plan to explore more types of hyper-parameters in FL, and generalize them into Dap-FL, which also remains in future works.</p>
