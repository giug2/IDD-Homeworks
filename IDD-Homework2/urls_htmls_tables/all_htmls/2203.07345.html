<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in deep learning methods bring computer-assistance a step closer to fulfilling promises of safer surgical procedures. However, the generalizability of such methods is often dependent on training on diverse datasets from multiple medical institutions, which is a restrictive requirement considering the sensitive nature of medical data. Recently proposed collaborative learning methods such as Federated Learning (FL) allow for training on remote datasets without the need to explicitly share data. Even so, data annotation still represents a bottleneck, particularly in medicine and surgery where clinical expertise is often required. With these constraints in mind, we propose FedCy, a federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) method that combines FL and self-supervised learning to exploit a decentralized dataset of both labeled and unlabeled videos, thereby improving performance on the task of surgical phase recognition. By leveraging temporal patterns in the labeled data, FedCy helps guide unsupervised training on unlabeled data towards learning task-specific features for phase recognition. We demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art FSSL methods on the task of automatic recognition of surgical phases using a newly collected multi-institutional dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach also learns more generalizable features when tested on data from an unseen domain.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Over the last decade, surgical data science<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has witnessed a surge of innovative applications due to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and improvements in hardware acceleration. The rise of such applications can also be largely attributed to algorithms developed and benchmarked on large publicly available labeled datasets reflecting a high level of surgical expertise. While this approach has demonstrated significant value, indicative of the potential of surgical data science to disrupt clinical practice, concerns regarding the scalability and generalizability of these methods are frequently echoed through much of the literature in the field <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Rightly, these concerns must be better understood, quantified, and addressed as we move towards the deployment of deep learning models in real-world settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the scalability of label-intensive approaches is severely hindered by its dependence on scarce annotations that are manually and laboriously generated by overburdened clinical professionals<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This bottleneck has limited the size of the few datasets that drive large chunks of research in the field. This has led to the development of methods to efficiently use fewer labels to supervise the training of deep learning models. In practice, this has meant using unlabeled data or easier-to-obtain labels in semi- or weakly- supervised settings<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While significant progress has been made, inching towards fully-supervised performance using progressively fewer and fewer labels, potential biases towards the demographics and medical institutions represented in public datasets still remain. This is in part due to prohibitive restrictions preventing the free transfer and publishing of sensitive medical data due to privacy and medico-legal concerns. Recently, a decentralized learning technique known as federated learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has been gaining popularity allowing for the training of models on remote edge devices or servers, circumventing the need to explicitly exchange data.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work falls squarely at the intersection of federated and semi-supervised learning.
We present a method, FedCy, for federated semi-supervised learning of surgical phases, that allows learning from completely unlabeled datasets using a single completely labeled dataset by leveraging temporal patterns that occur in all. We focus this work on being able to scale to independently-sourced unlabeled datasets considering the practical value of being able to adapt deep learning models to other medical centers without the need to simultaneously scale annotation expertise, processes, and time.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Surgical workflow modeling is often regarded as a key enabler to being able to analyze and support surgical procedures. In this regard, the ability to model a surgical procedure as a series of interlinked stages could enable systems that can describe, understand, explain, optimize, learn, teach, and eventually, automate the surgical process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Surgical phase recognition is the coarse recognition of surgical workflow and is often formulated as a classification task of video frames to one of several predefined phases. Over the last several years, surgical phase recognition has received growing attention from the surgical data science community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, resulting in increasingly performant models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and clinically relevant applications such as automatic video documentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and detection of deviations from the “normal” operative course <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Still, these methods were neither trained nor evaluated on videos from multiple hospitals, limiting their deployment in the real world. This is mainly due to the sensitive nature of medical data that impedes data sharing and, by consequence, data aggregation and training on centralized datasets. Recently, less invasive alternative collaborative methods have been proposed for leveraging data from multiple sources in a privacy-preserving fashion.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning has emerged recently as a promising collaborative learning method<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to mitigate data privacy concerns and the dependence of deep learning methods on developing in large centralized data lakes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In its vanilla setting, federated learning is a process where a central server coordinates and allows for multiple data owners to train collaboratively without having to explicitly expose their data. Data owners can be medical institutions or data centers and are hereinafter referred to as <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span>. Learning in a federated setting involves several clients iteratively training local models on their data, which are then aggregated by a central server to form a single global model that is used by each client as an initialization for the next round of local training.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Given the sensitive nature of medical data, federated learning has naturally been utilized in a variety of healthcare applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For instance, it has been used for detecting COVID-19 lung abnormalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and for brain tumor segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While federated learning bypasses the need to share data and facilitates collaborative training, the availability of labeled data still constitutes a major bottleneck, especially in healthcare applications. Participating in a supervised federated learning network requires each client to label their data. This is often prohibitively expensive in the medical domain, where data labeling commonly requires clinical expertise. Even assuming the availability of this expertise, the review and coordination on consistency across multiple clients are not always feasible without shared data. This is a major concern given the complexity and inherent ambiguities that several medical applications present.</p>

In FSSL, clients with labeled and/or unlabeled data collaborate to enhance training for all clients. FSSL has been addressed in several works, most of which utilize pseudo-labeling, a technique to automatically generate artificial labels using model predictions. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> first introduced a simple framework utilizing pseudo-labeling in a federated setting. Other works proposed methods to enhance pseudo-labels. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> utilized a dynamic thresholding strategy for selecting pseudo-labels based on model confidence along with having multiple clients vote to generate pseudo-labels. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> utilized peer learning and ensemble averaging from multiple clients. The aforementioned works primarily addressed the scenario where clients have partially labeled datasets, i.e. all clients have both labeled and unlabeled data.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A crucial aspect of our work is the importance of learning relevant temporal information from surgical videos, an issue that has not explicitly been addressed in any of the above works. Temporal modeling in federated learning and, more specifically, in FSSL is still relatively unexplored. Only a few applications exist such as traffic flow forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, audio recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, and machine fault diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

Aside from label distribution differences, our data are also characterized by a heterogeneity that originates from the different hospitals, such as surgical workflow, demographic, and hardware variability. This practical difference highlights the need for further study on real-world data, which has not been well investigated in previous works.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we describe our proposed federated semi-supervised learning method for surgical phase recognition. Surgical phase recognition is a single-label multiclass classification problem of surgical video frames. Though distinct scenarios have been described in previous works<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> of federated learning using varying amounts of labeled data at different locations, our work specifically assumes the presence of one fully labeled private dataset and several other completely unlabeled private datasets. Whereas our proposed method can be extended to utilize multiple labeled datasets, we choose to tackle this instance of label deficiency due to the practical limitations of generating consistent annotations for complex tasks without shared data and review processes. This represents the real-world use-case allowing to scale models to clients that do not have the technical and clinical bandwidth to generate consistently labeled datasets.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Context ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and empirically proved in our results, previous FSSL approaches may be suboptimal for the task of phase recognition. We, therefore, design our method to learn temporal patterns found in videos while effectively harnessing the task knowledge that can be learned from the labeled data. We adapt Temporal Cycle Consistency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, a self-supervised learning technique for learning temporal patterns, by guiding it to learn more task-relevant features through concurrently optimizing a contrastive loss on the labeled data. In the rest of this section, we first describe two core components of FedCy - Temporal Cycle Consistency and constrastive learning - and finally the federated training process.</p>

To do this, in addition to minimizing the supervised cross-entropy loss, we force representations of different classes to be more distant in the feature space by adding a contrastive loss term on the final objective of this client. We hypothesize that the parallel training objectives during each training round - the contrastive loss for supervised training and the TCC loss for unsupervised training - will complement each other. Further, we believe that propagating this learned knowledge through federated learning will drive the network towards finding more task-specific temporal correspondences from the unlabeled data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Surgical workflows may differ across hospitals, and hence annotation protocols designed for videos from a specific hospital might not generalize well to videos from another center. For instance, the protocol used to annotate Cholec80 made large use of instrument presence to define the boundaries of a phase, assuming a consistent use of instruments and sequence of phases across procedures. However, this is more likely to vary across hospitals. In addition, some phases might be performed differently across hospitals. Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2.1 The MultiChole2022 phase annotation protocol ‣ 4.2 Data Annotation ‣ 4 Datasets ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the case of <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Gallbladder Extraction</span>. In some hospitals, the gallbladder is extracted through the same trocar used to insert the endoscopic camera whereas in others a lateral trocar is used. Consequently, in the first case, the gallbladder extraction phase largely takes place out-of-sight whereas in the second strong visual cues can be defined that consistently mark the beginning of this phase. Given these considerations, we designed a new protocol in order to annotate the diverse 180 MultiChole22 videos. In brief, the primary differences between the MultiCholec22 protocol and the protocol used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> are: (1) Procedures are segmented into 6 phases rather than 7, excluding the Gallbladder Extraction phase for the aforementioned reasons; (2) Starting signals that mark the beginning of each phase are defined to focus more on actions rather than instrument usage to account for workflow variability.</p>

These methods were chosen to demonstrate the superiority of our approach to both naïve federated approaches and state-of-the-art designs that use the same amount of labeled data. The first baseline, FullSup-Cholec80, is trained on a fully labeled cholec80 train set. This presents the standard non-federated approach that excludes external unlabeled data from training. The next baselines, FedFixMatch, FedUDA, and FedTCC represent naïve adaptations of FixMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, UDA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and TCC pretraining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, respectively, using federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

This represents the strictest scenario in terms of privacy where no sharing of either data or models is involved in training. In contrast, FullSup-All, represents the most relaxed scenario, where a single model is trained on all the data collected together and treated as a single, centralized dataset. Finally, federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> represents the middle ground where models but not data can be transferred freely.</p>

Each experiment, except the pretraining phase of FedTCC, was run for a minimum of 6 epochs and stopped when the validation F1-score stops improving for 3 consecutive epochs. FedTCC was pretrained for 30 epochs. The Cholec80 dataset was divided into splits containing 40-8-32 (training-validation-testing) videos following state-of-the-art usage. Each of the other 4 datasets in MultiChole2022 was divided into splits of 13-6-6 (training-validation-testing) by stratified random sampling. In all semi-supervised experiments, only the Cholec80 validation split was used. The validation splits of all the datasets were only used for the fully supervised baselines.</p>

We firstly observe from FullSup-Cholec80, which is trained only on Cholec80 in a standard fully-supervised setting, that there are significant disparities between performance on different client datasets. In particular, the 21.5% gap in F1-score when testing on videos from the same client versus the average performance on videos from the other 4 clients highlights a major limitation of the generalizability of deep learning models. The development of principled, systematic, and accessible approaches to both train and evaluate on data sourced by varied and independent clients represents a significant step towards the clinical translation of such applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning-based approaches that can leverage the availability of unlabeled data from the other 4 clients expectedly show boosts in performance. For example, FedTCC which uses a ResNet-50 backbone that has been pretrained on all the unlabeled datasets using a federated averaging based implementation of TCC demonstrates an average boost of 4.8% F1 on the unlabeled datasets over FullSup-Cholec80. In fact, among the 3 proposed methods that use federated learning adaptations of popular self-supervised learning methods (FedFixMatch, FedUDA, FedTCC), we identify that TCC is particularly suited to this task, with FedTCC outperforming more sophisticated approaches like FedMatch and FedRGD on the unlabeled datasets. Our proposed approach, FedCy demonstrates markedly and consistently superior performance over all the presented FSSL approaches and the model trained on only Cholec80. Notably, this equates to an average increase of 4.2% and 9% F1 on the unlabeled datasets over the next best baseline in this category (FedTCC) and FullSup-Cholec80, respectively. We also see approximately the same overall performance of our approach whether it uses batch normalization or group normalization. Interestingly, despite using a large fully labeled dataset, FedCy also helps boost performance on the Cholec80 test set with an increment of 3.9% F1 over fully supervised training on only Cholec80. This may be attributed to a need for even more labeled samples or a regularizing effect provided by the training procedure on the unlabeled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When comparing against the models trained using labeled data from every client, we see that FedCy goes a long way towards bridging the gap in performance towards fully supervised approaches while significantly mitigating privacy and annotations concerns. To note, the non-collaborative approach FullSup-Each, where each client trains a tailored model on their dataset, performs 5.9% worse on average than training a global model trained on a single clustered dataset (FullSup-All). While this reflects the need for large and diverse datasets, this number may in fact understate this need because this baseline is predicated on the generation of independently but consistently annotated data. Impressively, on two of the five considered datasets, Cholec80 and D<sub id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub>, FedCy even outperforms the FullSup-Each baseline by up to 1.6%.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this ablation study, we aim to prove the effectiveness of FedCy, both in terms of formulation and configuration. To this end, we quantify the performance improvement brought about by learning from unlabeled data using TCC with different configurations and then demonstrate how TCC can be utilized for more effective representation learning using the contrastive learning-based approach presented in FedCy. In Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6.3.2 Interplay between training objectives ‣ 6.3 Ablation Study ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we vary the configuration of TCC presented in our formulation of FedCy using the following baselines: (1) Centralized pretraining of the ResNet-50 using TCC for each unlabeled dataset before finetuning on Cholec80 (Vanilla TCC) (2) Pretraining simultaneously on all the unlabeled datasets using a federated averaging based implementation of the TCC loss before finetuning on Cholec80 (FedTCC) (3) Training end-to-end using federated averaging with a cross entropy loss on Cholec80 and the TCC loss on the unlabeled datasets (FedCy). For all these experiments, we use our proposed sampling strategy for clip sampling and the default hyperparameters described in <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Implementation details ‣ 5 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>.

Still, the results for all considered models, including those trained on all 5 labeled datasets are considerably lower than those presented in <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Baselines ‣ 5 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> when tested on an independent dataset. Visible differences in instruments from all included training centers as well as more subtle variations in acquisition hardware, workflow, etc. may be causative factors. While external evaluations are not yet commonplace in the federated semi-supervised literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, this highlights a significant gap that needs to be further investigated and addressed to ensure that clinical applications are sufficiently adaptable to variations (e.g in patient demographics) which may not be adequately represented in available training datasets.</p>

<div id="S6.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whereas the previously presented results are based on a ResNet-50 feature extractor, state-of-the-art methods for supervised surgical phase recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> often additionally train temporal modules, such as multi-stage temporal convolutional networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, using the learned features extracted from the feature extractor. We study the quality of the features learned by FedCy and the other baselines by training a two-stage temporal convolutional neural network (TeCNO)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. We use Cholec80 to fine-tune TeCNO for all the semi-supervised baselines, and the corresponding client data for each of the FullSup-Each baselines. For FedAvg and FullSup-All, we correspondingly train TeCNO using federated averaging and a centralized dataset, respectively. In Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.6 Effect of Temporal Module ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we see that the previously noted improvements in the feature extractor (Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Baselines ‣ 5 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) also translate to gains in performance with the addition of the temporal module. Using the unlabeled data, we see improvements on both Cholec80 and the unlabeled datasets over state-of-the-art phase recognition performance (FullSup-Cholec80). Whereas the substitution of batch normalization with group normalization (FedCy-GN) does not significantly improve the predictive quality on single images (see Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Baselines ‣ 5 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), when used in tandem with the temporal context of a frame, the learned representational space seems to be much more expressive.  To ensure a fair comparison, we also reran all the baselines in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.6 Effect of Temporal Module ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> with group normalization. We note that FedCy-GN still outperforms all other semi-supervised benchmarks on the unlabeled datasets, by at least 3% F1-score, while staying on par with the much more label-intensive fully supervised baseline, FullSup-Each. Even without using group normalization, Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.6 Effect of Temporal Module ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows that FedCy outperforms all other benchmarks other than FedRGD, which does use group normalization. To note, even here, FedCy overall performance on all the datasets lies within 1.5 stds of the FedRGD overall performance on all the datasets across the 3 reruns. Here, FullSup-Cholec80 corresponds to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> but uses the newly generated phase labels and does not use instrument annotations.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We studied the task of surgical phase recognition of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) videos in a federated semi-supervised learning setting, highlighting the feasibility and efficacy of training on unlabeled datasets without the need to explicitly share data. To this end, we proposed a novel FSSL method, FedCy, to efficiently leverage the temporal knowledge found in labeled videos using contrastive learning to guide unsupervised training on unlabeled videos. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art FSSL methods showed significant improvements by our method in the task of surgical phase recognition on labeled, unlabeled and held-out datasets. To conduct this study, we generated a new diverse and large multicenter dataset of LC videos, annotated with 6 phases according to a newly introduced annotation protocol that is robust to workflow variations and reflective of surgical semantics. We believe that such diverse datasets can push multicenter research and evaluation, contributing to the clinical translation of tools for surgical video analysis.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">7.1 </span>Future Work</h3>

<div id="S7.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of our application, several limitations remain that we plan to address in future works. Firstly, the annotation protocol used to annotate the labeled dataset may still not be applicable to hospitals not participating in this study. Both this work and limitation emphasize the need for wider consensus on annotation protocols used to generate the precious datasets that drive work in the field. Besides that, a crucial property of FedCy is the critical role that the labeled dataset plays in guiding the unsupervised training. In this context, using a more representative dataset than Cholec80 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for supervised training could add another significant performance boost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in the FSSL scenarios where labeled datasets originate from sources different from those of the unlabeled ones, the data validation split used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection still poses a problem. Most of the FSSL work mentioned in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Context ‣ Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> simulate the federated learning setup by gathering data, reserving a validation and a test split, then splitting the training data into non-identically distributed datasets. In practice, and in our experiments, data validation splits correspond to only the labeled dataset, and hence hyperparameter tuning and model selection might be biased towards the labeled dataset. Such practical issues could be addressed in future work, for example, by using weak labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, future work might investigate how temporal modules can be adapted to FSSL methods, including FedCy. Common practices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> in the non-federated supervised settings involve using the learned features from the feature extractor as inputs to train a temporal module. Adapting such multi-stage training pipelines in a FSSL setting could boost performance, but is challenging due to memory constraints.</p>
