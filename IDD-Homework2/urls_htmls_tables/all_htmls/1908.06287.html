<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the increasing computational capacity of wireless user equipments (UEs), e.g., smart phones, tablets, or vehicles, as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data, a new machine learning model has emerged, namely federated learning (FL), that allows a decoupling of data acquisition and computation at the central unit.
Unlike centralized learning taking place in a data center, FL usually operates in a wireless edge network where the communication medium is resource-constrained and unreliable.
Due to limited bandwidth, only a portion of UEs can be scheduled for updates at each iteration. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, transmissions are subjected to interference and are not guaranteed.
The performance of FL system in such a setting is not well understood.
In this paper, an analytical model is developed to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks.
Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and inter-cell interference.
Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of three different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin (RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate.
It is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is operating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low.
Moreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold increases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of the update parameters.
The analysis also reveals a trade-off between the number of scheduled UEs and subchannel bandwidth under a fixed amount of available spectrum.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Next-generation computing networks will encounter a paradigm shift from a conventional cloud computing setting, which aggregates computational resources in a data center, to edge computing systems which largely deploy computational power to the network edges to meet the needs of applications that demand very high bandwidth and low latency, as well as supporting resource-constrained nodes reachable only over unreliable network connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">MaoYouZha:17</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">YanQue:17</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DinTanLa:17</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">LeeLeeQue:19</span>]</cite>.
Along with the burgeoning development of machine learning, it is expected that by leveraging computing capability in the edge nodes, usually access points (APs), future networks will be able to utilize local data to conduct intelligent inference and control on many activities, e.g., learning activities of mobile phone users, predicting health events from wearable devices, or detecting burglaries within smart homes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ZhuLiuDu:18</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ParSamBen:18</span>]</cite>.
Due to the sheer volume of data generated, as well as the growing capability of computational power and the increasing concerns about sharing private data at end-user devices, it becomes more attractive to perform learning directly on user equipments (UEs) as opposed to sending raw data to an AP.
To this end, a new machine learning model has emerged, namely federated learning (FL), that allows decoupling of data acquisition and computation at the central unit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KonMcMRam:15</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KonMcMBren:16</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">MaMMooRam:16</span>]</cite>.
Specifically, as illustrated by Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Scheduling Policies for Federated Learning in Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, an FL system optimizes a global model by repeating the following processes:

In this fashion, the global unit, i.e., the AP, is able to train a statistical model from the data stored on a swarm of end devices, i.e., the UEs, without sacrificing their privacy.
As such, the FL touts the trial as having smarter models, lower latency, and less power consumption, all while ensuring privacy. These properties identify the FL as one of the most promising technologies of future intelligent networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, to make FL possible, one needs to tackle new challenges that require a fundamental departure from the standard methods designed for distributed optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KonMcMRam:15</span>]</cite>. In particular, different from traditional machine learning systems, where an algorithm runs on a large data set partitioned homogeneously across multiple servers in the cloud, FL is usually trained from a large non-i.i.d., and often unbalanced, data set generated by distinct distributions across different UEs.
Just as crucial is what could happen at the parameter update stage: While an iterative algorithm running on FL requires very low latency and high throughput connection between computing units, the AP generally needs to link a vast number of UEs through a resource-constrained spectrum and thus can allow only a limited number of UEs to send their trained weights via unreliable channels for global aggregation.
These challenges make issues such as stragglers and fault tolerance for FL significantly more important than for the conventional training in data centers.
To deliver a successful deployment of FL, network operators need to adopt new tools and a new way of thinking: model development and training with no direct access to the raw data, with communication cost as a limiting factor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">NisYon:18</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanHanWan:18</span>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In response, considerable research has been carried out, which can be mainly categorized into two directions: algorithmic and communication.
From an algorithmic perspective, the idea is to reduce the overhead in the update uploading phase to make the model training communication efficient,
where typical methods range from reducing the communication bandwidth by only updating the UEs with significant training improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">CheGiaSun:18</span>]</cite>, compressing the gradient vectors via quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">AjiHea:17</span>]</cite>, or adopting a momentum method in the sparse update to accelerate the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">LinHanMao:18</span>]</cite>.
Recognizing that the unique properties of the wireless channel are not fully explored, another series of studies have followed up from the communication perspective.
Particularly, when the amount of training time is limited, solutions are taken by adapting the number of locally computing steps to the variance of the global gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanTuoSal:18</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanTuoSal:19JSAC</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanHanWan:18</span>]</cite>, or scheduling the maximum number of UEs in a given time frame <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">NisYon:18</span>]</cite>.
When spectral resources become the communication bottleneck, there are new methods exploiting the compute-over-air mechanism and arrive at
a jointly decode-and-average scheme at the edge computing unit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ZhuWanHua:18</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">YanJiaShi:18</span>]</cite>.
Moreover, if perfect channel state information (CSI) is not available at the receiver, the trade-off between delay and number of users selected for parameter updating has also been investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">HaZhaSim:19</span>]</cite>.
Among the prior work, the setup of communication is assumed in the single-cell scenario where received signals are affected only by the additive noise and thus can be correctly decoded upon each global aggregation. However, to fully realize the potential of federated learning, it is necessary to scale up the deployment across a large distributed network.
In this context, due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, communications are subjected to inter-cell interference and can encounter failure.
Additionally, since the spectral resources are generally limited, one needs to appropriately schedule the UEs for channel access upon each global update. To this end, for the successful delivery of FL in large-scale wireless networks, a complete understanding of its performance when operating under different scheduling schemes with unreliable communication links becomes essential.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to study the impact of different scheduling policies on the performance of FL in large-scale wireless networks. Specifically, we model the AP deployment and UE locations as independent Poisson point processes (PPPs), where every UE possesses a private data set and each AP needs to collaboratively learn a statistical model with its associated UEs through FL.
Recognizing the potential inefficiency of the conventional FL training approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanTuoSal:19JSAC</span>]</cite>, we leverage methods from distributed coordinate descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">MaKonJag:17</span>]</cite> and propose an algorithm that decouples the global averaging at the AP and local computing at each UE, whereas the partial solutions from UEs constitutes a proximal step toward the global optimal that implicitly accelarates the convergence.
By leveraging tools from optimization theory and stochastic geometry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">YanQue:ICC19</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">YanQue:19</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">YanGerQue:16</span>]</cite>, we derive tractable expressions for the FL convergence rate in a general setting that accounts for the employed scheduling policy and inter-cell interference that affects the data transmission phases.

<p id="S1.I1.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Through our analysis, we show that under high SINR threshold, running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR in terms of convergence rate, while RR is preferable when the SINR threshold is low.
Moreover, for networks operating under very low SINR thresholds, sending trained weights without scheduling can achieve better FL convergence rate than any scheduling methods employed.
The FL convergence rate is shown to decrease rapidly as the SINR threshold increases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of the update parameters.</p>

We adopt a block-fading propagation model, where the channels between any pair of antennas are assumed independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and quasi-static, i.e., the channel is constant during one transmission block and varies independently from block to block. We consider all propagation channels are narrow-band and affected by two attenuation components, namely the small-scale Rayleigh fading with unit mean power, and the large-scale path loss that follows a power law. Moreover, in consideration of spectral efficiency, we assume the whole spectrum is reused in every cell.</p>

As such, the FL algorithm has emerged, where the data collection process is decoupled from the global model training.

The AP periodically collects all the trained parameters from UEs to produce a global average and then redistributes the improved model back to the UEs.
After a sufficient amount of training and update exchanges, usually termed communication rounds, between the AP and its associated UEs, the objective function (<a href="#S2.E1" title="In II-B Federated Learning ‣ II System Model ‣ Scheduling Policies for Federated Learning in Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is able to converge to the global optimal.
When all the updates can be correctly received by the AP in every communication round, the convergence property of FL has been quantitatively demonstrated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KonMcMRam:15</span>]</cite>.
However, as the FL algorithm is generally run in a wireless setting where updates are sent through shared spectrum, which is unreliable due to random fading and inter-cell interference, updates from some UEs can be lost during the data transmission phase.
Moreover, the wireless medium is usually resource-constrained, and the AP thus needs to select a subgroup of UEs for parameter updates in each communication round.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the scheduling issue, the generic training approach per Algorithm 1 suffers potential setback of slow convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ZhaFenYan:19WCM</span>]</cite>, especially when the loss function or regularizer has a complicated form. Furthermore, the duration of local training in Algorithm 1 needs to be carefully designed so as to ensure the local solutions do not diverge from the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">WanTuoSal:19JSAC</span>]</cite>. As a result, the local training period needs to be small and that may incur a large number of communication rounds which is not desirable.
In that respect, we propose an algorithm, which will be elaborated in Section III, that presents a more suitable alternative to train FL in a wireless setting.</p>

Hence, sequentially updating the trained parameters from all UEs before global aggregation as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">NisYon:18</span>]</cite> can lead to large overhead in the communication time and is not desirable. Instead, the AP shall only select a subgroup of UEs and update their parameters simultaneously so as to keep the communication time within an acceptable range.
To this end, the scheduling policy plays a crucial role in assigning the resource-limited radio channels to the appropriate UEs.

However, because the wireless channels are generally unreliable, updates can be lost during the data transmission phase which leads to misalignment in the global and local parameters.
In the following, we will develop an algorithm that adapts the local training at each UE along with the communication condition in the global parameter updating phase.</p>

Note that although the depicted wireless network contains infinitely many APs, thanks to the stationary property of PPPs, the FL convergence rates of all APs are statistically equivalent.
As such, by applying Slivnyak’s theorem to the stationary PPP of APs, it is sufficient to evaluate the SINR of
a typical AP at the origin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">BacBla:09</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Hae:12</span>]</cite>.

Since the updated parameters from each UE have the same size, we assume the APs adopt a unified SINR decoding threshold in this network.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In any typical communication round, the probability of a generic UE being selected by its tagged AP depends on the scheduling policy employed. On the other hand, since both the signal strength and the interference received at a given AP are governed by a number of stochastic processes, e.g., the random spatial distribution of AP/UE locations and small-scale fading, the resulting SINR is a random variable.
As such, we define the following quantity, termed the <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter update success probability</span>, to characterize the transmission performance in each update</p>
