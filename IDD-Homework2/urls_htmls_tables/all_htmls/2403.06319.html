<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables training models on decentralized data. The field of FL security against poisoning attacks is plagued with confusion due to the proliferation of research that makes different assumptions about the capabilities of adversaries and the adversary models they operate under.
Our work aims to clarify this confusion by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the various poisoning attacks and defensive aggregation rules (AGRs) proposed in the literature, and connecting them under a common framework.
To connect existing adversary models, we present a hybrid adversary model, which lies in the middle of the spectrum of adversaries, where the adversary compromises a few clients, trains a generative (e.g., DDPM) model with their compromised samples, and generates new synthetic data to solve an optimization for a stronger (e.g., cheaper, more practical) attack against different robust aggregation rules.
By presenting the spectrum of FL adversaries, we aim to provide practitioners and researchers with a clear understanding of the different types of threats they need to consider when designing FL systems, and identify areas where further research is needed.</p>

Finally, the server aggregates the updates from all clients using an <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregation rule</em> (AGR), creating the next version of the global model.

As opposed to considering two (extreme) adversary models, i.e., compromised and fake, in this paper, we fill the gap between these two adversary models and present a spectrum of adversary models, as sketched in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Fake or Compromised?

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Introducing a hybrid adversary model.</span> 
As discussed above, the literature has only evaluated against two extreme adversary adversary models, i.e., all compromised and all fake adversarial clients.
We make the case for a <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hybrid adversary model</em> in which
the adversary compromises a very small number of actual users, and then uses their data to fabricate a large number of fake clients (who are supposed to be more impactful than oblivious fake clients considered in the literature).
Given the quick and broad adoption of FL in various applications, we believe that such hybrid adversary model can be representative of a very large fraction of FL applications in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Under such a hybrid adversary model, we propose a novel model poisoning attack, called <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hybrid attack</em>, that first leverages the data of compromised clients to <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">generate</em> more data using state-of-the-art generative models, e.g., the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The adversary then uses existing state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks to fabricate poisoned model updates for its compromised and fake clients (which are sent to the FL server).
DDPM is a generative model that has recently gained attention for its ability to learn the underlying structure of complex data distributions from limited and noisy observations. DDPM is based on the idea of diffusion, which is a process of iterative exchange of information between the data points in order to reveal their underlying structure. Specifically, DDPM uses a diffusion process to transform given input data into a latent representation, which captures the underlying structure of the data. This latent representation can then be used to generate new samples that are similar to the original input data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">One key advantage of DDPM is that it is able to learn the structure of the data distribution from a small number of observations, even in the presence of noise. This makes it particularly useful for applications where the data is limited or noisy, such as in the case of compromised clients in federated learning. By using DDPM to generate new samples from a small number of compromised clients, an adversary is able to craft a malicious update for FL poisoning that is representative of the data distribution of the benign clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to our focus on DDPM for generating synthetic data in poisoning attacks, we also explore another potent alternative which is utilizing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Our exploration into DCGAN, known for its proficiency in generating high-fidelity images, reveals its significant effectiveness in creating quality data for use in poisoning attacks on global models. Comparative analysis shows that while DCGAN and DDPM are both highly effective, DDPM demonstrates a superiority, particularly in generating more realistic synthetic data from limited and noisy datasets. This distinction is crucial in our hybrid attack model, where the quality of the generated data plays a pivotal role in determining the overall impact and effectiveness of the attack.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A poisoning attack is either <em id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data</em> or <em id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model</em> poisoning attack: in data poisoning, the adversary can poison only the data on malicious client device, while in model poisoning, the adversary can directly manipulate/poison the model updates of the malicious clients. In this work, we focus on model poisoning, as it is strictly stronger than data poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>; hence, poisoning in any context refers to model poisoning, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the types of adversaries in FL
that mount attacks with varying costs and impacts.
Fake clients are utilized in less secure FL systems where client injection is relatively easy. They are cost-effective but limited in their impact. Compromised clients appear on more secure FL systems, requiring sophisticated methods such as malware to take control of actual clients. Our novel contribution in the next section (Section <a href="#S5" title="V Our proposed hybrid adversary model ‣ Fake or Compromised? Making Sense of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>) is the introduction of a hybrid adversary model that combines these two approaches. This model reflects a more realistic scenario where an attacker might use a mix of fake and compromised clients, leveraging the ease of injecting fake clients and the authenticity of compromised ones to mount a more effective attack. This hybrid model embodies the complexity of real-world threats and underlines the need for versatile defensive strategies in FL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL) systems, an attacker can inject fake clients in order to send arbitrary fake local model updates to the cloud server. This type of attack is more affordable and easier to perform than compromising genuine clients, as the attacker does not need to bypass anti-malware software or evade anomaly detection on the clients’ devices. Instead, the attacker can emulate fake clients using open source projects or free software such as android emulators, which can be run on a single machine to emulate multiple instances, i.e., multiple FL clients, significantly reducing the attack cost. Fake clients also offer the advantage of being fully controlled by the attacker, as Android emulators can grant root access to the devices. These factors make model poisoning attacks using fake clients a realistic threat in FL systems.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compromising real clients in FL to launch a model poisoning attack can be a challenging task for an attacker. This is because genuine clients participating in FL are typically owned and controlled by different entities (e.g., individual users in cross-device FL and hospitals in cross-silo FL), and the attacker should get access to and take control of these clients in order to manipulate the updates they send to the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One way an attacker might try to do this is by using malware or phishing attacks to compromise clients. However, successfully executing these types of attacks requires a certain level of skill and resources, and the attacker would need to be able to bypass any security measures that the clients have in place. Additionally, the cost of compromising a large number of genuine clients can be high, as the attacker would need to pay for access to undetected zombie devices or other resources. This may make it infeasible for the attacker to compromise a large fraction of genuine clients, which is typically necessary for a model poisoning attack to be successful.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>Our novel hybrid attack pipeline: The adversary of hybrid attack lies in the middle of the spectrum of FL poisoning adversaries. The hybrid attack adversary compromises a few real FL clients, trains a denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM) on their real data, and generates new synthetic data to solve an optimization to generate malicious updates to mount strong model poisoning attacks against the target robust aggregation rules. Notably, if high-quality public data that mirrors real client data distribution is available, it can replace the initial data-gathering step in this process, although such data may not be readily available in proprietary contexts. Finally, the adversary shares the malicious update with the FL server via the compromised clients as well as (cheap to inject) fake clients.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another factor that makes it difficult to compromise real clients in FL is the decentralized nature of the system. In FL, clients are typically distributed across a wide geographical area and may have different levels of security and defenses in place. This can make it difficult for the attacker to gain access to and take control of a large number of clients simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, the combination of technical challenges and the high cost of compromising genuine clients in FL makes it a difficult task for an attacker to launch a successful model poisoning attack using only compromised clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Instead, we propose to use both fake and compromised clients to mount a hybrid attack. Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ V Our proposed hybrid adversary model ‣ Fake or Compromised? Making Sense of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the pipeline of our hybrid attack: The hybrid adversary first compromises a few real clients and then uses their data to generate synthetic data using a DDPM (Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Diffusion models ‣ II Background ‣ Fake or Compromised? Making Sense of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>). Next, the adversary uses these synthetic data to emulate FL clients and uses the model poisoning attacks (Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Adversary with compromised clients ‣ IV Distinguishing Fake And Compromised Adversary Models ‣ Fake or Compromised? Making Sense of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>) to craft strong malicious updates. The injected fake clients and compromised clients submit the generated malicious update if the server selects them in that FL round for their local updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Note that in Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ V Our proposed hybrid adversary model ‣ Fake or Compromised? Making Sense of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, Step 1 can be removed if the adversary is able to obtain (high-quality) data samples that represent the data distribution of typical clients. For example, if abundant public data is available related to the target FL task, the adversary can simply use such public data to synthesize the poisoning data for its fake clients. However, high-quality (i.e., representative) public data is not always available, especially in proprietary applications.</p>

The goal of the adversary is to mount a model poisoning attack against an IoT application, e.g., predicting traffic at a certain location. The application stores and uses images from traffic cameras, and trains a global image classification model using FL. With high probability, these IoT devices are also part of some botnet, and the cost of owning such zombie devices in a botnet can be as low as <math id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math>.

We assume that an adversary can acquire control of zombie devices in a botnet for $1 per device. Furthermore, we consider that only 1% of these devices possess the target application with real data. This implies that out of 100 purchased zombie devices, 99 do not have any real data (suitable for fake attacks), while one device has access to real data, which can be used for a compromising attack.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, if the attacker aims to launch a compromising attack with 100 malicious clients, they would need to purchase 10,000 zombie devices. Assuming a cost of $1 per control of each device, the total cost amounts to $10,000. In contrast, if the attacker desires 100 fake clients, the cost would be $100. If the attacker wants a hybrid attack with 3 compromised clients possessing real data and 97 fake clients, the cost would be $300. However, if the attack requires 1 real client and 99 fake clients for a compromising attack, the cost would be $100. We provide the cost of each attack scenario in each table based on the required number of malicious clients and the type of attack.</p>

This means it cannot produce any new samples for these labels. For compromising 0.3%, the adversary does not have access to any samples from label 9. For FEMNIST, we also used the same generated data assignment (produce non-idd), and we collected the data samples of the first 4 (0.1%), 7 (0.3%), and 11 (0.5%) of the clients.</p>

We use the code provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> to generate new samples for the hybrid attacks. This code implemented the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in PyTorch. It is a transcribed code from the official Tensorflow version <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. It uses denoising score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution, followed by Langevin sampling to sample from the true distribution.
After collecting the data samples of compromised clients, we ran the DDPM on these images for each label separately to generate new samples. To train the diffusion model, we used a batch size of 8, learning rate of 0.00008, and 250 sampling size. To generate samples for CIFAR10, we used 2000 diffusion steps, and for FEMNIST we used 1000 diffusion steps.</p>

We consider a range of malicious client percentages, including 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, and report the maximum test accuracy and the impact of various attacks on the global model. For each attack, we also report attack cost, the number of benign, compromised, and injected fake clients present in the FL training process.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider five different attack scenarios, ranging from injecting fake clients with no knowledge of the true data distribution to a scenario where the adversary can compromise benign clients and use their data to craft malicious updates. Additionally, we propose and evaluate three types of hybrid attacks, where the adversary first compromises a small number of real clients and then uses their data to generate synthetic samples using a DDPM, followed by injecting fake clients with the new data samples. We explore the impact of different numbers of compromised clients in these hybrid attacks, specifically 0.5% (5 clients), 0.3% (3 clients), and 0.1% (1 client) in CIFAR10 experiments and 0.5% (17 clients), 0.3% (11 clients), and 0.1% (4 clients) in FEMNIST experiments. We rank the attacks in terms of their impact on the global model accuracy, to better illustrate the spectrum of attacks.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our findings indicate that the most potent adversary, who has compromised real clients, exerts the most significant influence on the global model. For instance, on the CIFAR10 dataset with the Median as the AGR, an attack by 10% (20%) malicious clients reduces the model’s accuracy to 33.10% (10.61%). This implies that the attacker first compromised 100 (200) clients out of the total clients participating in FL and launched the attack described in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Adversary with compromised clients ‣ IV Distinguishing Fake And Compromised Adversary Models ‣ Fake or Compromised?

<p id="S7.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, fake clients, who do not have any knowledge about the benign clients’ data distribution, have the least impact on the global model. For example, on CIFAR10 with Median as the AGR, an attack launched by 10% (20%) of malicious clients reduces the accuracy of the global model to 49.04% (32.78%). To accomplish this, the adversary must inject 112 (251) fake clients into the FL training, which incurs costs of $112 and $251, respectively, considerably cheaper than compromising attacks.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Hybrid attacks, positioned in the middle of the spectrum, reveal that if the hybrid adversary has access to more data (more compromised clients), they can inflict more significant damage on the global model’s accuracy. For instance, in the CIFAR10 dataset with the Median as the AGR, a hybrid attack involving 20% malicious clients, where the adversary has compromised 1, 3, and 5 clients while generating new instances and injecting 249, 247, and 244 new fake clients, can reduce the FL model’s accuracy to 13.29%, 11.71%, and 11.49%, respectively. These attacks cost $250, $300, and $500, respectively, which is very close to the cost of the fake attacks. Similar observations are made for the FEMNIST dataset as well.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our results indicate that adversaries who can compromise clients and use their data for attacks have the most significant impact on FL global models. For instance, on the CIFAR10 dataset, an adversary who has compromised 10% (20%) of clients, with a cost of $10,000 ($20,000), reduces the accuracy of FL by 55.83% (73.66%) and 49.29% (60.37%) with Trimmed-Mean and Multi-Krum, respectively. On the other hand, adversaries who can only inject fake clients into the FL training with no knowledge of the true data distribution have the lowest impact on global model accuracy. For instance, on the CIFAR10 dataset, an adversary who can inject 10% (20%) of clients, with a cost of $112 ($251), reduces the accuracy of FL by 39.78% (51.17%) and 1.32% (3.55%) with Trimmed-Mean and Multi-Krum, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments also show that the hybrid attack, which compromises only a few clients and use their data to produce more data samples for the fake clients, lies in the middle of the spectrum. The more clients are compromised, the more damage is done to the global accuracy. For instance, on the CIFARA10 training, a hybrid attacker who compromised 1 client, i.e., 0.1% of total clients, and can inject 110 clients (in total 10% malicious ratio) with a cost of $111, can reduce the accuracy of the FL model by 54.24% and 35.2% for Trimmed-Mean and Multi-Krum respectively. While if the hybrid attacker compromised more clients (5 clients) and injected 106 clients (in total 10% malicious ratio), with a cost of $500, it can reduce the FL global accuracy by 55.77% and 47.79% for Trimmed-Mean and Multi-Krum, respectively.</p>

On the other hand, Multi-Krum can easily detect them and exclude them from aggregation. For instance, on CIFAR10, 10% of injected fake clients (with $112 attack cost) can reduce the accuracy of the model by 26.34% and 39.78% with Norm-Bounding and Trimmed-Mean as the aggregation rule, respectively. On the other hand, Multi-Krum only loses 1.32% with the presence of this number of injected fake clients.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our previous experiments, we exclusively utilized Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for generating new images in our hybrid poisoning attacks. The choice of DDPM was motivated by its proven effectiveness in creating high-quality synthetic data. These models excel in producing data that closely resembles real datasets, a critical factor for successful poisoning attacks in federated learning. To broaden our investigation, we now consider alternative baselines for generating poisoning updates: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and the direct use of original images from compromised clients.</p>

The attack impacts using DCGAN are comparable to those using DDPM. For instance, under the Multi-Krum aggregation rule, the global model’s accuracy is reduced by 43.51% and 47.79% using DCGAN and DDPM, respectively. This indicates that while both methods are potent, DDPM may have a slight edge in generating more realistic synthetic data, especially with limited and noisy datasets. The quality of generated data is pivotal in our hybrid attack model, as it significantly influences the attack’s effectiveness.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The results also highlight that replicating data samples from compromised clients leads to a diminished attack impact. This is attributed to the high similarity in updates from these malicious clients. For instance, using replicated data under the Multi-Krum only reduces the global model’s accuracy by 6.52%. This experiment demonstrates a higher variance in accuracy across all aggregation rules, further emphasizing the need for a generative model to achieve a higher and more stable attack impact.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this work presents a comprehensive study of the poisoning threats to FL by considering a spectrum of adversaries and robust AGRs. We discussed the importance of considering a spectrum of adversarial models, rather than focusing on the extremes, as it provides a more realistic understanding of the poisoning threat to various types of FL applications. We identify a hybrid adversary model where an adversary first compromises a few real clients and use their data to generate more data samples for the fake clients to mount a large-scale attack. For such a hybrid adversary, we propose a novel hybrid attack that leverages the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate new samples from a small number of compromised clients.</p>
