<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-enhancement and latency minimization in various real-world applications, such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. FL endeavors to bring Machine Learning (ML) down to the edge by harnessing data from million of devices and IoT sensors, thus enabling rapid responses to dynamic environments and yielding highly personalized results. However, the increased amount of sensors across diverse applications poses challenges in terms of communication and resource allocation, hindering the participation of all devices in the federated process and prompting the need for effective FL client selection. To address this issue, we propose Cellular Automaton-based Client Selection (CA-CS), a novel client selection algorithm, which leverages Cellular Automata (CA) as models to effectively capture spatio-temporal changes in a fast-evolving environment. CA-CS considers the computational resources and communication capacity of each participating client, while also accounting for inter-client interactions between neighbors during the client selection process, enabling intelligent client selection for online FL processes on data streams that closely resemble real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the proposed CA-CS algorithm using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, while making a direct comparison against a uniformly random client selection scheme. Our results demonstrate that CA-CS achieves comparable accuracy to the random selection approach, while effectively avoiding high-latency clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has gained substantial attention in current research, standing out as one of the most popular machine learning topics regarding privacy concerns and latency minimization. Its wide-ranging applications in various domains like autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> have established it as a comprehensive solution for privacy-enhanced, low-latency distributed machine learning. The market value for federated learning is expected to double by 2030 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, providing a significant impetus for the development of new algorithms aimed at enhancing FL efficiency and performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the remarkable progress in FL algorithms and its diverse applications, several limitations and unresolved issues still remain. Two of the most significant constraints of FL involve the presence of non-identically and independently distributed <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(non-iid)</span> data due to the massive distribution of data among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which limits its predictive accuracy and the increased <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communications costs</span> brought on by the random selection process during federated rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. A promising solution to address these issues is to perform intelligent client selection methods. For instance, Lei Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose that an effective client selection scheme could serve as a solution to address data heterogeneity while simultaneously enhancing fairness, robustness, model accuracy, and reducing communication costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of FL, data is decentralized across multiple data silos owned by different clients. Each client conducts local training using its private data, resulting in local model parameters. Only the learnable parameters, typically model weights, are transmitted to a central server. The central server then aggregates these received model parameters to create a global model, which is transmitted back to each client for updating their local parameters. FL clients are often numerous, comprising millions of smart devices or IoT sensors globally. However, due to potential connection issues or limited processing capacity, not all clients may be consistently available to participate in the FL process.
To avoid heavy computational and communication overhead associated with training and propagating weights across millions of devices simultaneously, FL comprises a client selection mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This technique involves selecting only a subset of clients to participate in each federated round. Although this strategy alleviates some of the computational burden, it may introduce fairness and robustness issues, leading to decreased accuracy, particularly when the data distribution among clients is non-iid.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A cellular automaton (CA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> refers to a discrete computational model comprising a grid of cells, where each cell exists in one of a finite set of states. These cells’ states evolve over time based on a predefined set of rules, which rely on the states of their neighboring cells. Complex systems can be investigated through CA, where computational power is merged with mathematical and physical foundations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, with examples to be evident in epidemic propagation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, chemical computing representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and resolution of complex logic puzzles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In the context of client selection in FL, a cellular grid can be utilized to represent clients, where each cell is associated with a fitness value denoting the suitability or eligibility of the respective client for participation in the FL process. During each federated round, the cell states undergo updating procedures, taking into account the states of neighboring cells and adhering to specific updating rules. This mechanism allows the CA to perform computations, resembling a client selection scheme for FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above, we present a novel client selection algorithm for FL that leverages CA. This algorithm takes into account both the computational capabilities and communication limitations of each participating entity, as well as the standard deviation of their data. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated across multiple FL scenarios, and the results demonstrate its potential, as it identifies and excludes stragglers while maintaining high prediction accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a novel federated client selection algorithm by leveraging CA to capture clients’ computational and communication capabilities, and we formulate an experimental setting to comprehensively evaluate our proposed algorithm in a vehicular network problem using the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. In this direction, we pave the way for investigating inter-client relations during client selection, which to the best of our knowledge, has not been adequately addressed in the related literature.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several works address the topic of client selection in FL aiming to improve both performance of the predictive models based on data and model quality, as well as efficiency of the FL process by minimizing training and communication times and taking into consideration resource capabilities of each client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multiple papers have focused on biased client selection strategies to improve the error convergence speed and efficiency in FL. Cho et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose the UCB-CS strategy, which leverages bandit-based techniques to achieve faster convergence with lower communication overhead, thereby addressing intermittent client availability and communication constraints.
Moreover, the issue of optimizing communication efficiency between the server and clients has been addressed through innovative sampling approaches. Fraboni et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> introduced a clustered sampling approach, which leads to better client representativeness, reduced variance in the clients local weights, and improved training convergence and variability compared to standard sampling approaches.
Similarly, Shen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> presented a clustering-based approach to accelerate the convergence of FL by reducing variance and generating client subsets with certain representativeness of sampling.
Huang at al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> addressed the issue of volatile clients, who may experience training failures due to various reasons. They proposed a stochastic client selection scheme, E3CS, that considers effective participation and fairness and achieves faster convergence while maintaining high accuracy.
In the context of FL in vehicular networks, where heterogeneity among network users is a significant factor, Cha et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> introduced a fuzzy logic-based client selection scheme. This approach considers various factors, such as the number of local samples, sample freshness, computation capability, and available network throughput, to choose appropriate clients for participation in the training process. In this paper, we emphasize on exploring the inter-client relations among immediate neighboring nodes. These connections frequently emerge as a result of local network topologies, geographical arrangements, or logical associations. To this scope, we leverage a Cellular Automaton adept at capturing these types of relationships for effective FL client selection.</p>

For each FL node, an indicator, called Throughput Congestion (TC), is calculated based mainly on the samples quantity of the respective node and it’s participating one hop neighbors. We assume that this is a metric indicating the communication capabilities of the node, with higher TC meaning more traffic around the node, thus decreased communication throughput available. Whenever, a client from the top 20% of those with the highest TC is selected, the whole simulation is delayed by 5 seconds, denoting a penalty for selecting stragglers. The percentage of clients that are considered as stragglers and the associated time penalty are indicative and related to the specific problem formulation.</p>

However, it’s essential to recognize that the update rule we designed for the CA in our example imposed execution time penalties on clients with high numbers of samples, i.e., those with substantial communication traffic. Additionally, clients with one-hop neighbors with high sample quantities were also affected by these penalties, assuming that excessive communication traffic in one neighborhood might lead to delays in other nodes within the network topology.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to client selection in FL using CA. Our CA-CS algorithm intelligently captures clients’ computational and communication capabilities, enhancing the efficiency of FL systems. Through comprehensive experiments with CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we evaluated the CA-CS algorithm, comparing it to random selection. While the CA-CS algorithm did not significantly outperform random selection in terms of predictive accuracy and F1 scores, it excelled in reducing execution times by avoiding high-latency clients, making it a valuable asset in resource-constrained scenarios. The evaluation of the CA-CS performance in systems with uniform levels of congestion will need to be carried out through future experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, our research demonstrates the potential of CA for effective client selection in FL, setting the stage for further advancements and optimizations in this area for real-world applications.
Possible future directions would include but are not limited to modifying the CA update rule to address other critical challenges, such as data and model heterogeneity, fairness, communication costs, and resource allocation, especially when these factors heavily rely on the data within one-hop neighborhoods. Finally, other spatio-temporal models, e.g. graphs, could be utilized to capture inter-client relations.</p>
