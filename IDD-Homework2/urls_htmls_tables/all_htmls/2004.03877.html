<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service, is increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing paradigm, traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) that focus mainly on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> are gradually evolving into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The IoV is an open and integrated network system which leverages on the enhanced sensing, communication, and computation capabilities of its component data sources, e.g., vehicular sensors, IoT devices, and Roadside Units (RSUs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, to build data-driven applications for Intelligent Transport Systems, e.g., for traffic prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, traffic management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, route planning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and other smart city applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of IoV components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond ground data sources, aerial platforms are increasingly important today given that modern day traffic networks have grown in complexity. In particular, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used today to provide data collection and computation offloading support in the IoV paradigm. The UAVs feature the benefits of high mobility, flexible deployment, cost effectiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and can also provide a more comprehensive coverage as compared to ground users. UAVs can be deployed, e.g., to capture images of car parks for the management and analysis of parking occupancy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, to capture images of roads and highways for traffic monitoring applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and also to aggregate data from stationary vehicles and roadside units that in turn collect data of other passing vehicles periodically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Apart from data collection, the UAVs have also been used to provide computation offloading support for resource constrained IoV components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As such, studies proposing the Internet of Drones (IoD) and Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have gained traction recently. Moreover, the DaaS industry is a rapidly growing one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that comprises independent drone owners which provide on-demand data collection and model training for businesses and city planners.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Naturally, to build a better inference model, the independently owned UAV companies can collaborate by sharing their data collected from various sources, e.g., carparks, RSUs, and highways, for collaborative model training. However, in recent years, the regulations governing data privacy, e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are increasingly stringent. As such, this can potentially prevent the sharing of data across DaaS providers. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative ML across a federation of independent DaaS providers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In our system model (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles: A Multi-Dimensional Contract-Matching Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), a client, hereinafter model owner, is interested in collecting data from a region for model training, e.g., for traffic prediction. Given the energy constraints of UAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the region is further divided into smaller subregions. The model owner then announces an FL task, e.g., the capturing of real-time traffic flow over highways or the collection of data from RSUs for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Then, only the DaaS providers, hereinafter UAVs, that are able to complete the task within the stipulated time and energy constraints respond to the model owner. Thereafter, the model owner assigns an optimal UAV to each subregion. After the UAV collects the sensing data, model training takes place on each UAV separately, following which only the updated model parameters are transmitted to the model owner for global aggregation.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed approach has three advantages. Firstly, the resource constrained IoV components are aided by the UAV deployment for completion of time sensitive sensing and model training tasks. Secondly, it preserves the privacy of the UAV-collected data through eliminating the need of data sharing across UAVs. Thirdly, it is communication efficient. The reason is that traditional methods of data sharing will require the raw data to be uploaded to an aggregating cloud server. With FL, only the model parameters need to be transmitted by the UAVs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">However, there exists an incentive mismatch between the model owner and the UAVs. On one hand, the model owners aim to maximize their profits by selecting the optimal UAVs which can complete the stipulated task at the lowest cost, e.g., in terms of sensing, transmission, and computation costs. On the other hand, the UAVs can take advantage of the information asymmetry and misreport their types so as to seek higher compensation. To that end, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> as an incentive mechanism design to appropriately reward the UAVs based on their actual types. In particular, given the complexity of the sensing and collaborative learning task, we consider a multi-dimensional contract to account for the multi-dimensional sources of heterogeneity in terms of UAV sensing, learning, and transmission capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">After deriving optimal contracts to which the UAVs respond to, the possibility that multiple UAVs prefer a particular subregion still remains.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, given the rising popularity of UAVs, there is an increasing number of UAV-related studies in the literature. One group of studies focus on the fundamental issues related to the challenges of UAV deployment, e.g., trajectory optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, communication constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, as well as the efficient assignment and deployment of UAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Another group of studies propose specific applications of UAVs, e.g., as flying base stations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, with mobile cloudlets for computation offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and for search and rescue missions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In particular, the UAVs are also increasingly considered for providing sensing services, i.e., data collection, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and for the development of IoV related applications, e.g., for traffic prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, localization of ground vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, and to facilitate vehicular communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The market of UAVs as service providers, e.g., in on-demand data collection, is a rapidly growing one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Given the heterogeneity in UAV types, e.g., in energy constraints and computation capabilities, the incentive mechanism design for UAV systems is an important issue. The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> adopts a game theoretic approach to analyze the offloading decisions of UAVs acting as flying cloudlets for IoT devices. In contrast, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> proposes the contract-theoretic approach to incentivize UAV base stations to contribute higher transmit power for enhanced coverage over wireless networks. In consideration of the limited availability of mobile charging stations for UAVs, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> proposes an auction-based approach to efficiently assign the UAVs to specific charging time slots so as to reduce congestion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, given the nascent field of FL, there are relatively few works that propose FL based collaborative learning schemes involving UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, the study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> is the first to propose the implementation of FL for joint power allocation and scheduling of UAV swarms. With the increasingly stringent regulations related to data privacy, the adoption of FL can facilitate collaborative learning for the development of effective AI models, without the exchange of potentially sensitive raw data. As such, there is an urgent need to consider the incentive mechanism design for FL in UAV networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To that end, we can take reference from the growing literature related to incentive mechanism design for FL. For example, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> adopts a contract-theoretic approach to motivate workers to contribute more computation resource for efficient FL. On the other hand, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> formulates the Stackelberg game to analyze the inefficiency in model update transfer. As an extension, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> uses a Stackelberg game formulation together with Deep Reinforcement Learning to design a learning-based incentive mechanism for FL. For a comprehensive survey in this area, we refer the readers to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the traditional considerations of incentive design in FL, the UAV systems involve other sources of heterogeneity in UAV types, e.g., traversal costs. As such, the multi-dimensional sources of heterogeneity in UAVs have inspired us to adopt the multi-dimensional contract theoretic approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> in our incentive mechanism design. Moreover, in contrast to traditional works in contract theoretic mechanism design, our system model only involves the matching of a single, optimal UAV type to each subregion. This necessitates the use of the matching-based algorithm such as the GS algorithm. The use of matching for UAVs to subregions have also been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> does not have any mechanism in place to ensure truthful reporting, while we leverage on the self-revealing properties of contract theory to that end. While the study of contract-matching has also been explored for resource allocation in vehicular fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, the contract considered is single-dimensional with simpler considerations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our study considers the adoption of FL to facilitate privacy preserving sensing and collaborative learning in the UAV services market, and proposes a multi-dimensional contract-matching design that aims to match the most optimal UAV to each sensing subregion, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity in UAV types.</p>

Given information asymmetry and the multiple sources of heterogeneity in UAV cost types, the model owner leverages on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract theoretic approach to choose one UAV suited to cover each of the subregion. After data collection, the UAV returns to their respective UAV bases for Federated Learning (FL) based model training.</p>

As such, the model owner designs a multi-dimensional contract to leverage on the self-revealing mechanism so as to select the optimal UAV to cover each subregion.

Intuitively, for each region, the model owner leverages on the self-revealing properties of the multi-dimensional contract formulation to obtain an optimal UAV with the lowest marginal cost of node coverage for profit maximization. In other words, this is the UAV that can cover the largest proportion of the subregion at the lowest cost, among all feasible UAVs that can complete the task. We can substitute the optimal rewards into the profit function of the model owner and rewrite the profit maximization problem as follows:</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have considered an FL based sensing and collaborative learning scheme involving UAVs for applications in the IoV paradigm. Given the incentive mismatches between the UAVs and the model owners, we have proposed a multi-dimensional contract-matching incentive design such that the UAV with the lowest marginal cost of node coverage is assigned to each subregion for task completion. For future works, we may consider the adoption of wireless charging techniques with energy harvesting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> such that the UAVs can perform sensing and model training simultaneously, without the need to return to their bases. In that case, the incentive mechanism design will involve the considerations of one more player type, i.e., the wireless charging service provider.</p>
