<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained devices became a significant research direction.
Numerous compression methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one (student).
However, due to various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing research problem that has been addressed by various works.
In this paper, we point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Large-scale deep learning models have achieved overwhelming success over many different learning tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the huge computational complexities and massive storage requirements make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices with low power and storage capacities such as mobile phones. Knowledge Distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a popular method used in compressing complex models and has been proven to be successful in maintaining model performance after compression  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
The process can be defined as extracting knowledge from a complex pre-trained neural network, called the teacher, to train a relatively more compact student network.
This extraction is generally done by forcing the student to imitate the responses of the teacher against the training data. Unfortunately, this data dependency can cause problems when the compression
process is carried out by
groups other than the model developers. In such scenarios, the group that attempts compression might not have access to the training data due to privacy-related issues or they might not have the means to relocate and store the dataset if it is large in volume. Hence, the whole process could become infeasible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recognition of this problematic coupling of KD with data has recently attracted attention from the scientific community  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
A common way to address this problem is to use synthetic samples for distillation. This task is often referred to as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data-free knowledge distillation</span> in the literature. Most of the existing works utilize a neural network (generator) to generate synthetic samples. The network parameters are updated throughout distillation via feedback from the teacher network and/or teacher-student performance gap (see Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Data-Free Knowledge Distillation ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>). Although the reported results are promising, they still need improvement for data-free methods to become the standard way of compressing image models. There are two aspects of the current data synthesis strategies that we identified as performance bottlenecks.
The first one is that, using only newly generated samples to train the student after each time generator’s weights are updated
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, could cause the student network to forget the knowledge it acquired in the earlier steps. The reason is that, unlike in regular KD, the synthetic data distribution changes over time as the generator is updated in data-free methods. Therefore, performing KD only with a freshly generated batch, without having stored samples from earlier iterations, could cast the student vulnerable against such distribution shifts.
Secondly, targeting the generation of samples over which the student and the teacher have maximum disagreement  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, could yield a student that is optimal for a different distribution than the original data.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above-mentioned performance bottlenecks, we propose a memory mechanism to store generated samples over iterations and a generator objective that targets samples that both maximize teacher-student disagreement and approximate real data distribution.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The term <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Catastrophic Forgetting</span> was defined by French <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to describe the loss of previously learned information observed in neural networks when they are sequentially trained to learn new information. Unlike natural cognitive systems, neural networks cannot retain the knowledge they had previously acquired while they keep learning from new data. To preserve such knowledge, they should also be exposed to old data at every update. Goodfellow et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> investigated the extent to which catastrophic forgetting affects neural networks. To alleviate these effects, Kirkpatrick et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed to selectively slow down the learning rates of the weights associated with the previously learned information.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first one is called <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model inversion</span> and can be described as inverting the information flow in a neural network to reconstruct appropriate input samples based on the imposed constraints. Nayak et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed to account for the correlations between target classes while generating samples. They used these correlations to construct soft target labels that describe how synthetic samples should be. Yin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> used one-hot target labels and applied the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the model-to-be-inverted (teacher) and the student to diversify the synthetic samples. Haroush et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> leveraged the batch normalization statistics to make the synthetic data better mimic the real training data. One weakness of the model inversion-based methods is that they require a vast amount of time to create sufficiently large datasets for distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Another one is that some methods include loss terms that constrain the synthetic images to be realistic in the learning objective. The synthesis of realistic images could violate the goal of preserving privacy related to the training data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second approach is to use a generator that, once trained, can produce synthetic data suitable for KD. Yoo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> published an early work in this category and proposed a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to generate images that can be recognized by the teacher model. Later, these images are used to distill the knowledge from the teacher to the student. However, by separating the image generation process from KD, this work does not directly attempt to optimize distillation performance. Chen et al.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> used a data-free GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> setup and included the distance between the teacher and student responses as a term to be minimized in the objective function.

Throughout the paper, we will refer to these samples as ”novel” samples. The disagreement between the teacher and the student is used as a proxy to quantify the information gain.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework contains a generator that produces synthetic samples to distill knowledge from the teacher to the student. We train the generator and the student in two separate stages, alternatively. During the training stage of the generator, the target is to produce samples that are both novel to the student and can be classified by the teacher with high confidence. Later, when the turn comes to the student, it is trained to imitate the responses of the teacher against the generated data. We also include a fixed-sized memory mechanism to remind the student of the information presented to it over time.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.12" class="ltx_p">Here we emphasize that, once the student is optimized to imitate the teacher for a set of novel samples, the teacher-student disagreement over those samples will diminish.
Therefore, in the next turn, the generator will attempt to produce different samples for which the student still can not imitate the teacher’s responses. This can result in catastrophic forgetting as the distribution of our synthetic samples change over iterations causing the student to forget the information gained in earlier time steps. An example case is given in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Data-Free Knowledge Distillation ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. In the example, the teacher is trained to classify 2-dimensional data points into 3 classes, denoted by red, green, and blue. Later, a student model is trained by the synthetic samples, marked with yellow crosses, at each epoch. The synthetic samples change over epochs and there is no common sample between synthetic sets across epochs. It can be observed that when we train the student with the synthetic samples generated at the 3rd epoch, the knowledge learned earlier about the green class is forgotten. This example visualizes catastrophic forgetting caused by the above-mentioned data synthesis strategy, in an observable space.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To prevent such problem, we propose to store some of the samples generated throughout iterations, in a memory bank. Since the number of accumulated memory samples could increase linearly with the arbitrarily selected number of training epochs, we use a fix-sized list to maintain our bank. The bank is updated periodically at a desired rate by inserting generated samples. If the sample list has reached maximum size, we replace a randomly selected batch with the batch of new samples.
The procedure is described in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting ‣ 3 Method Description ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

However, this approach fails to maintain high-quality distillation across different benchmarks. We observed this issue after conducting experiments with various new datasets and student architectures. Throughout our experiments, the training/testing performances of the student models were unstable and highly impacted by the hyper-parameter choices. We attribute this to the lack of constraint to generate samples that come from a similar distribution as the training data. Without such constraint, the distillation can result in a student network that is optimized to imitate the teacher for a certain sample subspace which is different from the original training data. Thus, the student might fail to behave like the teacher when presented with samples from the original data distribution. Even if during the distillation, the novel samples coincidentally correspond with real samples, once the student is optimized for them, the next batches of novel samples will be different. If the distillation continues after such correspondence, the student will forget the decision boundaries related to the real data distribution, causing its accuracy on the real test set to degrade.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">is an image classification dataset composed of 70,000 grey-scale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Training set consists of 60,000 images while the testing set consists of 10,000. This benchmark is simple and therefore student-teacher gaps in most methods are very small. For the experiments on MNIST, we selected LeNet-5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> as the teacher and LeNet-5-Half as the student. The teacher model was achieving 98.9% accuracy on the test set. Our method performed comparably with the DAFL and DFAD baselines while outperforming RDSKD. Our experiments revealed that when we set the memory size as 10 batches and update frequency as 1 per 5 epochs, the accuracy increases more consistently (see Figures <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ CIFAR100 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>a and <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ CIFAR100 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>b). However, we achieved the best results with the update rate of once in every 1 epoch and the memory bank size of 10 batches. Additionally, we plot the learning curves of the student obtained by our method and the baselines, during distillation. The Figures <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ CIFAR100 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>a and <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ CIFAR100 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>b demonstrate
that
our method
can reduce the variance among student accuracies achieved throughout epochs. This is desirable in real-life applications since, if there is no evaluation data during the distillation process, it is best if the student model performs at its peak when the process ends. Therefore, maintaining high student accuracy over iterations is as important as achieving it. Based on the plots, our method accomplished these better than the baselines DAFL and DFAD.

This dataset is similar to MNIST with the difference of having RGB channels therefore the benchmark is again relatively simple. For the experiments on SVHN, we selected ResNet-34 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> as the teacher and ResNet-18 as the student. The teacher model was achieving 96.3% accuracy on the test set. Our method outperformed all baselines.

The number of samples ratio for training and testing sets is 5/1. This benchmark contains less salient samples for classification and therefore is more challenging than MNIST and SVHN.

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Fashion MNIST</h4>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">is a dataset of 70,000 grey-scale cloth images from 10 different categories. The number of samples in the training and testing sets are 60,000 to 10,000 respectively. To compare our work with DAFL and DFAD, we selected ResNet-34 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> as the teacher and ResNet-18 as the student. The ResNet-34 teacher model was achieving 94.1% accuracy on the test set.
Our method outperformed both baselines. The improvement our method achieves over Fashion MNIST is much clearer than it achieves over other benchmarks. This could be due to a particular organization of the teacher decision space, tightening the performance bottleneck of the baselines caused by their above-mentioned weaknesses. We note that the results of our baselines we report are obtained after running repeated experiments with different random initializations. Even after numerous trials, DFAD could not maintain the distillation quality it achieved in other benchmarks. We relate this to its frailty against non-optimal hyper-parameter choices, which is also recognized by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The update frequency for the memory bank is a hyper-parameter that needs to be pre-determined and set before distillation. To find the optimal value, we compared the behaviors of different update rates for MNIST dataset distillation. Since the randomness in the parameter initialization could have affected our comparison, we set the random seeds manually. The memory bank size is limited to contain at most 10 batches. We shared the outcome of our experiments in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ CIFAR100 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>a. From the plot, it can be observed that regardless of the choice of update rate, the usage of memory bank improved the peak and final values of student accuracy while also causing fewer fluctuations. Moreover, among the update frequencies we tested, 1 update per 5 epochs performed better than others by resulting in a more smooth learning curve and higher student accuracy. Meanwhile, updating the stored samples every epoch, caused larger fluctuations relative to other choices. We attribute this to the rapid refresh rate unable to store samples for enough iterations. On the other hand, the less frequent update periods such as 7 and 10 could be causing failure to memorize some informative samples generated in between updates.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we identify two problems that impair data-free knowledge distillation performance and propose methods to solve them. These are catastrophic forgetting and, mismatch between synthetic and real data distributions.

<br class="ltx_break">Addressing the first problem, we proposed a memory system where we keep the history of generated samples over iterations. While this simple approach manages to suppress the negative effects of catastrophic forgetting on student accuracy, it also increases the secondary memory overhead and slows down distillation. Therefore, we believe future efforts could be directed to find more efficient ways to prevent catastrophic forgetting in data-free KD. Some possible improvements could be achieved by selectively storing samples and/or by storing compressed versions of the samples.

<br class="ltx_break">To remedy the second problem, we propose a data-free KD strategy that constrains the generated novel samples to match the distribution of the original data. This way, we ensure that the synthetic samples distinguishing the teacher from the student are not irrelevant to the original training data. Additionally, to produce such distinguishing samples we adopt Jensen-Shannon divergence as a loss term and compare it with other alternatives.

<br class="ltx_break">Experimental results show that our framework not only improves data-free knowledge distillation performance for certain datasets, but also maintains high student accuracy throughout the entire process.</p>
