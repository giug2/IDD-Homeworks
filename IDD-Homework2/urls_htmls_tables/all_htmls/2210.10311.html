<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning framework that requires different clients (e.g., Internet of Things devices) to participate in the machine learning model training process by training and uploading their local models to an FL server in each global iteration. Upon receiving the local models from all the clients, the FL server generates a global model by aggregating the received local models. This traditional FL process may suffer from the straggler problem in heterogeneous client settings, where the FL server has to wait for slow clients to upload their local models in each global iteration, thus increasing the overall training time. One of the solutions is to set up a deadline and only the clients that can upload their local models before the deadline would be selected in the FL process. This solution may lead to a slow convergence rate and global model overfitting issues due to the limited client selection. In this paper, we propose the <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>atency awar<span id="id3.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">E</span> <span id="id3.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>emi-synchronous client <span id="id3.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>election and m<span id="id3.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">O</span>del aggregation for federated lear<span id="id3.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">N</span>ing (LESSON) method that allows all the clients to participate in the whole FL process but with different frequencies. That is, faster clients would be scheduled to upload their models more frequently than slow clients, thus resolving the straggler problem and accelerating the convergence speed, while avoiding model overfitting. Also, LESSON is capable of adjusting the tradeoff between the model accuracy and convergence rate by varying the deadline. Extensive simulations have been conducted to compare the performance of LESSON with the other two baseline methods, i.e., FedAvg and FedCS. The simulation results demonstrate that LESSON achieves faster convergence speed than FedAvg and FedCS, and higher model accuracy than FedCS.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous smart devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and virtual reality headsets, are widely used to digitize people’s daily lives. Traditionally, a huge volume of data generated by these IoT devices is uploaded to and analyzed by a centralized data center that generates high-level knowledge and provides corresponding services to users, thus facilitating their lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A typical example is smart home, where various IoT devices, such as smart meters, thermostats, motion detectors, and humidity sensors, are deployed to monitor the status of the smart homes. The data generated by the IoT devices would be uploaded to a centralized data center, which applies deep reinforcement learning model to intelligently and autonomously control, for example, the smart bulbs and air conditioners in the smart homes, to improve the quality of experience and reduce the energy usage of smart homes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, sharing data with third-party data centers may raise privacy concerns as data generated by the IoT devices may contain personal information, such as users’ locations and personal preferences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As a result, various policies have been made, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) made by the European Union <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, to regulate and hinder data sharing. In order to fully utilize these personal data while preserving privacy (i.e., without sharing the data), federated learning (FL) is proposed to distributively train machine learning models by enabling different IoT devices to analyze their data locally without uploading them to a central facility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. A typical example to use FL is to train a next word prediction model, which is used to predict what word comes next based on the existing text information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Basically, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Latency Aware Semi-synchronous Client Selection and Model Aggregation for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, an FL server would first initialize the parameters of the global model and then broadcast the global model to all the clients via wireless networks. Each client would train the received global model based on its local data sets (i.e., their text messages) and upload the updated model to the FL server via wireless networks. The FL server then aggregates the received models from the clients to generate a new global model, and then starts a new iteration by broadcasting the new global model to the clients. The iteration continues until the model is converged.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional FL method can resolve the privacy issue to allow the clients to train the model locally, and it applies the synchronous strategy, where the FL server has to wait until it receives the models from all the clients in each global iteration. This may lead to the straggler problem when the configurations of clients are heterogeneous, meaning that they have different computing and communications capabilities. Hence, some stragglers take much longer time to train and upload their models in a global iteration because of their lower computing and communications capabilities, and thus significantly prolong the model training process. To resolve the straggler problem, many client selection methods have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which would select the qualified clients that can finish their model training and uploading before a predefined deadline. Normally, client selection and resource allocation are jointly optimized to maximize the number of the selected qualified clients. Selecting the qualified clients can resolve the straggler problem, but may raise other issues. First, the proposed client selection may significantly reduce the number of participated clients, which may slow down the convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, thus leading to longer training latency (which equals to the sum of the latency for all the global iterations). Second, the proposed client selection may result in the model overfitting issue caused by the reduction of data diversity. That is, if the FL server only selects the qualified clients to participate in the model training, then the generated model can only fit the data samples in these qualified clients, but not the non-qualified clients. The model overfitting issue would be compounded if the data samples of the qualified clients are not sufficient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The other solution to solve the straggler problem is to apply asynchronous FL, where the FL server does not need to wait until the deadline expires for each global iteration, but would update the global model once it receives a local model from a client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, the asynchronous FL may suffer from 1) the high communications cost since both the FL server and clients will more frequently exchange their models, and 2) the stale issue, where some slow clients are training based on an outdated global model, which may lead to slow convergence rate or even global model divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

The basic idea of LESSON is to allow all the clients to participate in the whole learning process with different frequencies. Specifically, the clients are clustered into different tiers based on their model training and uploading latency. The clients in a lower tier (i.e., lower model training and uploading latency) would participate in the learning process more frequently than those in a higher tier (with higher model training and uploading latency). As a result, the straggler problem can be resolved (since the FL server does not need to wait for stragglers in each global iteration) and the model overfitting problem can be fixed (since all the clients join the learning process to provide high data diversity).

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">How to solve the straggler issue is one of the main challenges in synchronous FL. The existing solutions mainly focus on jointly optimizing client selection and resource allocation. Nishio and Yonetani <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> aimed to maximize the number of selected clients that can finish their model training and uploading before a predefined deadline in each global iteration. By assuming that the selected clients have to iteratively upload their models to the FL server, they designed FedCS that jointly optimizes the uploading schedule and client selection to achieve the objective. Abdulrahman and Tout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> designed a similar client selection method FedMCCS. The goal of FedMCCS is to maximize the number of selected clients, who can not only finish the model training and uploading before a predefined deadline but also guarantee the resource utilization less than the threshold to avoid device dropout. Albelaihi <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a client selection method that tries to achieve the same objective as FedCS, but they argued that the latency of a client in waiting for the wireless channel to be available for model uploading should be considered; otherwise, the selected clients may not upload their local models before the deadline. Yu <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed to dynamically adjust and optimize the tradeoff between maximizing the number of selected clients and minimizing the total energy consumption of the selected clients by picking suitable clients and allocating appropriate resources (in terms of CPU frequency and transmission power) in each global iteration. Shi <em id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> also jointly optimized the client selection and resources allocation for FL. However, the objective is to minimize the overall learning latency (which equals the product of the average latency of one global iteration and the number of global iterations), while achieving a certain model accuracy. They formulated a system model to estimate the number of global iterations given the global model accuracy requirement. All the mentioned client selection method for synchronous FL can alleviate the straggler problem, but may lead to the slow convergence rate and model overfitting issues as we illustrated previously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Instead of selecting qualified clients to avoid stragglers, Li <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed to let fast clients train their local models by running more gradient descent iterations in each global iteration. In this way, the fast and slow clients could upload their models at the similar time, but the fast clients may provide better models to fit their local data samples, thus potentially speedup the model convergence. This method, however, may lead to local model overfitting issue when some fast clients run too many gradient descent iterations over the limited data samples. The overfitted local models would significantly slow down the global model convergence. Wu <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed to perform spilt learning, where a global neural network is divided into two parts. The parameters in the former and latter layers are trained in the clients and the FL server, respectively. As a result, the computational complexity of the clients is reduced, thus potentially reducing the training time and energy consumption of the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other works aim to design asynchronous FL, where the FL server does not need to wait for the selected clients to upload their local models; instead, once the FL server receives a local model from a client, it would aggregate the received local model to update the global model, and then send the updated global model to the client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. However, as mentioned before, the fast clients and the FL server have to more frequently exchange their models, thus leading to higher communications cost for both the fast clients and FL server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, in asynchronous FL, the slower clients may train their local models based on an outdated global model, which results in slow convergence or even leads to model divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the drawbacks in synchronous and asynchronous FL, we propose the semi-synchronous FL to allow all the clients to participate in the whole learning process with different frequencies. Although the term ”semi-synchronous FL” has been used by the existing works, the definitions are different from what we defined in this paper. For example, Stripelis and Ambite <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> defined semi-synchronous FL as the clients to train their local models over different sizes of local data sets, depending on their computing capabilities. The semi-synchronous FL proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> periodically re-selects a number of clients, and follows the same method as asynchronous FL to aggregate and update the global model.</p>

This is because FedCS only selects fast clients to participate in the training process, and so the derived global model can only well fit the data samples for fast clients, not slow clients, thus reducing the model accuracy. Meanwhile, the convergence rate with respect to the number of global iterations for LESSON and FedAvg is also very similar, which is slightly faster than FedCS. However, by evaluating the convergence rate with respect to the time, as shown in Figs <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Simulation results ‣ V Simulation ‣ Latency Aware Semi-synchronous Client Selection and Model Aggregation for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(c) and <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Simulation results ‣ V Simulation ‣ Latency Aware Semi-synchronous Client Selection and Model Aggregation for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(d), we find out that LESSON is faster than FedAvg. For example, the global model in LESSON has already converged at 20,000 seconds for MNIST, but the global model in FedAvg is still under-trained. This is because the FL server in FedAvg has to wait until the local models from all the clients have been received in each global iteration, and thus the latency of a global iteration incurred by FedAvg is much higher than that incurred by LESSON.

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the data diversity and straggler issues in the synchronous FL while avoiding model divergence in the asynchronous FL, we propose a semi-synchronous client selection and model aggregation algorithm, i.e., LESSON, which allows all the clients to participate in the FL process but with different frequencies. Simulation results demonstrate that, in the IID setting, the model accuracy incurred by LESSON and FedAvg is similar but high than FedCS, and the convergence rate incurred by LESSON is the highest. In the non-IID setting, FedAvg achieves the highest model accuracy at the cost of lowering the convergence rate, and LESSON still incurs the highest convergence rate. Also, the other advantage of LESSON is that we can adjust the deadline <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> in LESSON to change the tradeoff between the model accuracy and model convergence rate with respect to the time.
