<p id="6.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) models fail catastrophically on questions related to the reading of text-carrying images. However, TextVQA aims to answer questions by understanding the scene texts in an image–question context, such as the brand name of a product or the time on a clock from an image. Most TextVQA approaches focus on objects and scene text detection, which are then integrated with the words in a question by a simple transformer encoder. The focus of these approaches is to use shared weights during the training of a multi-modal dataset, but it fails to capture the semantic relations between an image and a question. In this paper, we proposed a Scene Graph-Based Co-Attention Network (SceneGATE) for TextVQA, which reveals the semantic relations among the objects, the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tokens and the question words. It is achieved by a TextVQA-based scene graph that discovers the underlying semantics of an image. We create a guided-attention module to capture the intra-modal interplay between the language and the vision as a guidance for inter-modal interactions. To permit explicit teaching of the relations between the two modalities, we propose and integrate two attention modules, namely a scene graph-based semantic relation-aware attention and a positional relation-aware attention. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, Text-VQA and ST-VQA. It is shown that our SceneGATE method outperforms existing ones because of the scene graph and its attention modules.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Significant progress for multi-modal tasks that demand the simultaneous processing of both images and texts has been made in the past few years, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one of the prominent multi-modal tasks that requires answering natural language questions by inferring from the content of the given images. However, the nature of the questions and images of many existing VQA datasets is deficient in training the model to build a comprehensive understanding of human everyday scenes. For example, the collected photo-realistic images of many conventional VQA datasets exclude the texts that commonly appear in daily-life scenes, and the questions are merely designed to examine the recognition of objects and their attributes, such as colors and sizes. To overcome this limitation of existing conventional VQA datasets and to train models with better understandings of texts in realistic scenes through question answering, a new variant of VQA tasks, TextVQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Singh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, was recently proposed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Images in TextQA tasks are collected from realistic scenes that contain various formats of texts, e.g., brand names and price tags, and the questions are specifically designed to be answered by referring to the textual information in the images. Hence, in addition to the recognition of objects as in the conventional VQA task, it is necessary for TextVQA models to additionally recognize the texts that are associated with the objects and capture these textual features from the images. Most current TextVQA models rely on the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique to directly extract the textual characters from images as OCR tokens and then integrate these OCR token features with image and question features for answer prediction, as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Singh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Zhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, the use of OCR tokens as an additional sequence of inputs to image object features and question word features can hardly reveal or capture the relations between the texts and their related objects in images. Such relations are significant in answering questions that show the explicit positional or semantic relationships between the objects and the textual characters, such as the relation <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">on</span>
between <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UMD</span> and <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">uniforms</span> in the question <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“What university is represented <span id="S1.p2.1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">on</span>
these uniforms?”</span> in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. To capture the relatedness between objects and OCR tokens, some recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Kant et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed to implicitly represent the relationships between objects and OCR tokens through their absolute locations. However, assuming such positional proximity as “relatedness” is not reliable and could be ambiguous, because irrelevant objects that are in different categories might be located in similar positions around one OCR token.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome this problem, we propose an explicit representation of the relationships between the OCR tokens and their associated objects in an image with the help of a scene graph. A scene graph <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Johnson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> is a graph structure that annotates the attributes of objects and the relationships between objects in an image. In this work, we propose a novel scene graph structure, specifically for TextVQA tasks, by assigning the OCR tokens as the attributes of objects to represent the affiliations of OCR tokens with their related objects. The scene graph embedding is encoded via the semantic embeddings of the objects and OCR tokens of the scene graph; thus, compared to previous works that only considered the visual features of objects, such scene graph embedding captures the relationships between objects and OCR tokens from the semantic aspect. A semantic relation-aware attention module is also applied to obtain the ultimate scene graph embedding that encodes the different semantic relationships between the objects and the OCR tokens.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another problem that this work tries to solve is to achieve much more intense interactions between the multi-modal inputs for TextVQA models and thus generate a better answer representation for the final answer prediction. Most of the previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> directly input different modalities (i.e., image, question and OCR token features) into a multi-modal transformer; although some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Zhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> made additional interactions for some modalities beforehand, these interactions were rather weak because there was a lack of simultaneous self-attention learning within each modality. Thus, we propose a Scene Graph-Based Co-Attention Network (SceneGATE) that includes a co-attention module consisting of two attention units: self-attention that boosts the intra-interactions for each modality and the guide-attention unit that uses the question features to guide the attention learning for the image and OCR token features. A positional relation-aware attention module is applied to the integrated visual features of objects and OCR tokens. Such integration enables the model to additionally learn relationships between the OCR tokens and their related objects from the positional level. The SceneGATE network operates on the two branches of scene graph features and the visual-level integrated multi-modal features in parallel, such that the relationships between objects and OCR tokens from both the semantic level and positional level are highlighted. The overall architecture of SceneGATE can be found in Figure  <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Look, Read, Reason and Answer</span> (LoRRA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Singh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> was the first baseline model for TextVQA tasks. It simply encodes the OCR tokens by FastText embeddings and enables the use of any type of contextual attention mechanism to integrate the questions, images and OCR token features. Further works have been proposed to solve the TextVQA problem from various aspects; for example, ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Modal Multi-Copy Mesh</span> (M4C) with an enriched OCR representation to capture more properties of the OCR tokens. Such enriched OCR token features are then projected with the object regions and question features into the same joint embedding space through the multi-modal transformer encoder. As an extension of M4C, ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> captured the relationships between the object regions and their related OCR tokens by encoding the OCR-related object features through softmax attention, which are the result of learning the locations of corresponding OCR tokens and the object regions. Others have proposed graph structures to better represent and encode the relationships between OCR tokens and the related object regions. For example, <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text">ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite></span> built three different graphs to represent the visual, semantic and numeric information of OCR tokens and object regions, where the nodes of the graphs are updated from locationally related nodes. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kant et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed a spatially-aware graph attention module to emphasize the importance of different types of relative spatial relationships between OCR tokens and objects. Similarly, ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> also utilized the graph attention module but this was conditioned on the relationships between the OCR tokens and the objects that were revealed from the question structural patterns. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed to align the related OCR tokens with the question by using a two-stage module that aligns the question with images via the pre-trained visual grounding task and then aligns the question and OCR tokens through object labels. Different from using an off-the-shelf OCR module, as in all the previous works, a recent study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zeng et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> integrated the training of the OCR technique into the flow of an end-to-end TextVQA model to mitigate the influence of poor OCR accuracy on the final answer prediction. A comparison of the TextVQA models can be found in Table <a href="#S2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 2.2 Conventional VQA ‣ 2 Related Work" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> is a multi-modal task that requires answering natural language questions by looking at given images. The answer representation is generated from the inputs with different natures in essence: images formed by pixels and questions formed by semantic words. To align the image features and question features into the same joint embedding space for answer prediction, previous VQA works mainly adopt two different methods: fusion techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shrestha et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Ben-Younes et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Cadene et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and attention mechanisms. The attention mechanism in VQA tasks ranges from the basic vanilla attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hudson and Manning (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Anderson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> to the recent, commonly used co-attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yu et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Such a co-attention mechanism aims to obtain a stronger interaction between different modalities by using the attention weights learned from individual modalities to guide the attention of each other. In this work, we use the guided-attention module for stronger intra-modal integration for OCR tokens, images and question features.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Recently, scene graphs have also been used in VQA. For example, ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Luo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> processed the scene graphs and image features simultaneously through two parallel branches of recurrent memory networks to improve the model’s reasoning ability over objects’ relationships. <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hudson and Manning (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite></span> proposed to use a probabilistic scene graph of images as the state machine, where questions were transformed into instructions to perform the reasoning process. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Haurilet et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> claimed that only partial scene graphs are effective for answer prediction and proposed a selective system to choose the most important path in a scene graph and the most probable destination node on the graph to predict the answers. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nuthalapati et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> used a graph attention network to encode scene graph embeddings to leverage the relatedness between different objects. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> applied the pre-training pipeline for Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) tasks by incorporating object-based scene graphs in transformer layers to focus on semantically adjacent object nodes within multiple hops, regardless of relationship types. Nevertheless, our work is the first to apply a scene graph in TextVQA tasks and we propose a novel TextVQA-based scene graph structure to explicitly represent the affiliations between objects and OCR tokens.</p>

We train two different GCNs in terms of different node labels. In the object-GCN, we manually categorize all the object types into 60 super-classes based on the hypernym of the synset (synonym set) of each object token and use these 60 super-classes as the labels of each object node during GCN training. In the attribute-GCN, we label each attribute node with the attribute tokens’ named entity recognition (NER) types. (We used the Google Cloud NLP API to identity the entity type: <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities</a>, accessed on 30 June 2023).

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our model with two widely used benchmark datasets: Text-VQA and ST-VQA. The Text-VQA dataset was proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Singh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> in 2019. Different from the conventional VQA datasets, images in the Text-VQA dataset contain texts in different formats, and the questions are specifically designed to be answered by referring to the textual information in images. The Text-VQA dataset collects 28,408 images that contain texts from the Open Images v3 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Krasin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. There are 45,336 question–image pairs in the Text-VQA dataset, which are split into 34,602, 5000 and 5734 for training, validation and testing, respectively. Each question has 10 ground truth answers, and the voting of these 10 answers is used to compute the soft accuracy score. The ST-VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Biten et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> is a concurrent work of the Text-VQA dataset.

There are 17,028 images/23,446 questions for the training set, 1893 images/2628 questions for the validation set and 2971 images/4070 questions for the test set. Each question has at most 2 ground truth answers to compute the accuracy score by soft voting, similar to the VQA context.

The downstream SA and GA modules have a dimension of 768, with 8 attention heads and a dropout rate of 0.1. Our experiments are conducted utilizing an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU with 24 GB RAM, a 16 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900X CPU @ 3.50 GHz with 128 GB RAM and the operating system of Ubuntu 20.04.1. Our final model contains around 95 million trainable parameters and requires around 0.6 h to train one epoch. The validation accuracy converges within 40 epochs of training for most of our model variants, and our best model converges within 8 epochs on both datasets. In short, the training of our best-performing model requires around 3GB GPU RAM and 4 h to complete. We use a batch size of 8 and follow the same settings as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kant et al.

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from other works that used ST-VQA to enlarge the training dataset size, we compared the performance of our model with different baselines by training only on the original Text-VQA dataset. We can see from Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Performance Comparison ‣ 6 Results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> that our model outperformed all the baselines and yielded the state-of-the-art result of 42.37% validation accuracy and 44.02% test accuracy on the Text-VQA dataset. We ran the code provided by SA-M4C to train the Text-VQA dataset with their default hyperparameters. Their results were only 40.71% and 42.61% for the validation and test accuracy, respectively, which were almost 2% lower than our model. Compared with M4C, SNE and LoRRA, which simply used the attention mechanism to integrate the different modalities, the models (SMA, SA-M4C and SceneGATE) that applied the graph attention module achieved better performance, indicating the importance of the explicit representation and encoding of the relationships between objects and their related OCR tokens for the TextVQA task. However, both SMA and SA-M4C considered only the visual representation of object nodes and their spatial relationships, when the node embedding of OCR tokens in a graph was updated. Our model overcomes this limitation via the additional encoding of the semantic embeddings of object nodes and the semantic relationships among different objects and OCR tokens with the use of the scene graph. Our results also indicate the importance of such semantic relationship representation and the scene graph in the TextVQA task.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the accuracy rate, we also used the Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) score, which was proposed for the evaluation of the ST-VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Biten et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, as an additional evaluation metric to evaluate the performance on ST-VQA. The ANLS score aims to eliminate the dropped performance caused by OCR recognition errors. It compares the similarities between the ground truth answers and the prediction results, rather than the robust identity, as when using the accuracy rate. The edit distance of converting a prediction string into a ground truth string is measured by this metric in order to give a soft score for the prediction. If the edit distance is greater than 0.5, it can be considered as an incorrect prediction not resulting from OCR recognition mistakes, and a score of 0 is given. Otherwise, the difference of this edit distance from 1.0 is awarded as the prediction score. A higher ANLS score indicates that more accurate predictions are made by the model. The performance of our models and the baselines is compared in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.1 Performance Comparison ‣ 6 Results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and we can see that our model greatly outperforms the baselines by achieving 41.29%, 0.525 and 0.516 for the validation accuracy, validation ANLS score and test ANLS score, respectively. Our model achieved a 1.5% improvement in accuracy, a 0.028 improvement for the validation ANLS score and a 0.039 improvement for the test ANLS score compared to the base model SA-M4C, which performed slightly worse than its base model M4C in terms of accuracy and achieved only around a 0.01 increase in the ANLS score on both the validation set and test set compared to its base model, M4C. The larger performance gap achieved by our model compared to our base model shows the importance of considering the semantic relations among the objects and OCR tokens.</p>

To examine the impact of different scene graph node embedding initialization methods on the model’s performance, we also evaluated the model’s performance in using GCN and GloVe for node embedding initialization on both the Text-VQA and ST-VQA validation sets. We can see from Table <a href="#S6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 6.2 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> that GloVe had the worst results, with only 41.33% and 40.79% accuracy on both the Text-VQA and ST-VQA validation sets, while the use of GCN would increase the performance slightly. FastText resulted in the best performance considering that FastText is more capable of dealing with the OOV issue for the cases of rare OCR tokens in a scene graph.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. This simple approach achieved 39.13% and 37.78% accuracy on the Text-VQA and ST-VQA validation sets, respectively, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 6.2 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. After the addition of the co-attention module for the better inter- and intra-integration of the image, question and OCR token features, the performance on the validation and test sets increased significantly to 41.27% and 39.57%, indicating the effectiveness of such self-attention-based guided attention. The inclusion of PRA attention layers gave an improvement in the accuracy rate by around 0.7%, and the performance rose further to 42.37% and 41.29% for the Text-VQA and ST-VQA validation sets after adding the SRA attention layer over the scene graphs. These results prove the critical roles of the co-attention, PRA and SRA attention layers in our model.</p>

Since having two multi-modal transformer encoder (MMTE) layers worked the best for the SA-M4C model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kant et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, we started by fixing the number of final BERT layers to two and adopted all the combinations of numbers in the range [1, 3] for the number of PRA attention layers and the number of SRA attention Layers. We empirically observed that models with two PRA attention layers always performed better than others (rows 4–6 vs. other rows), yielding validation accuracy of more than 41.8%. In addition, having two layers for each type of attention layer worked the best. Based on these two observations, we fixed the number of SPA layers to two and tested the model with a smaller number of SRA attention layers and MMTE layers. Eventually, we found that having two PRA attention layers, one SRA attention layer and one MMTE layer was able to yield the best validation accuracy result, 42.37%.</p>

The OCR tokens and their associated object regions with high attention weights are highlighted with yellow and red bounding boxes in the images. Compared with other baselines, our model generated more accurate and complete answers with the correct corresponding OCR tokens regions detected in the images. For example, our model perfectly identified the brand of the beer with the answer <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Coors Light</span>, while M4C missed the token <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Light</span> and LoRRA and SA-M4C gave incorrect results for the case in the top-right image. In addition, our model also showed good inference ability in addition to text-reading ability. Taking the bottom-right image as an example, to answer the question of <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How many items can you get for $5?</span>, the model can not only recognize the correct location of <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">$5</span>, but it also has the ability to understand the semantic meaning of the <em id="S6.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">forward slash</em> in the image and to interpret the character before this symbol as a number. Our model provided the correct answer, while the answers of LoRRA and SA-M4C were incorrect.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose SceneGATE with the use of a novel TextVQA-based scene graph by treating the OCR tokens in images as the attributes of the objects. Our SceneGATE applies semantic relation-aware attention to the scene graph and uses the guided attention mechanism to obtain the question-guided object and OCR token features, which are then fed into the graph attention module for the learning of the positional relationships between objects and OCR tokens. Our SceneGATE comprehensively learns the semantic and positional relationships between objects and texts in images and outperforms the SOTA on both the Text-VQA and ST-VQA datasets.</p>

<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure <a href="#A2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Appendix B Additional Qualitative Examples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we show some qualitative examples of the errors that our SceneGATE model makes.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first row shows examples of when our model inherits mistakes made by the OCR system.
Based on the bounding boxes visualized, we can observe that SceneGATE is attending to the correct entities, giving almost correct answers. In the first example, the model is attending to the <span id="A3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">startling stories</span> region of the image, and in the second example, the model attends to the word printed on the black jersey but gives “kidover” as the answer instead of “andover”. This is because the OCR token provided by the pre-trained OCR model is wrong. When the model dynamically copies the OCR tokens as the answer, it inherits the error made by the OCR system despite its own ability to choose the correct elements. Since TextVQA models largely depend on the information of scene texts, the accuracy of pre-trained OCR systems could be a bottleneck for the TextVQA problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second row shows examples in which our predictions can also be considered as correct answers although they are different from the ground truths. Taking the instance on the left as an example, <span id="A3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">yosemite</span>, <span id="A3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">national</span> and <span id="A3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">park</span> are the top three OCR tokens that our model attends to, and our model outputs all three words as the answer, which is actually correct to answer the given question. Similarly, in the example on the right, the button to be pressed is called <span id="A3.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">press start</span>, so our model attends to both words and outputs them as the answer.</p>
