<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables privacy-preserving model training through periodic communication between edge devices and the server.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted edge devices are particularly advantageous for FEEL due to their flexibility and mobility in efficient data collection.
In UAV-assisted FEEL, sensing, computation, and communication are coupled and compete for limited onboard resources, and UAV deployment also affects sensing and communication performance. Therefore, the joint design of UAV deployment and resource allocation is crucial to achieving the optimal training performance.
In this paper, we address the problem of joint UAV deployment design and resource allocation for FEEL via a concrete case study of human motion recognition based on wireless sensing.
We first analyze the impact of UAV deployment on the sensing quality and identify a threshold value for the sensing elevation angle that guarantees a satisfactory quality of data samples.
Due to the non-ideal sensing channels, we consider the probabilistic sensing model, where the successful sensing probability of each UAV is determined by its position.
Then, we derive the upper bound of the FEEL training loss as a function of the sensing probability.
Theoretical results suggest that the convergence rate can be improved if UAVs have a uniform successful sensing probability.
Based on this analysis, we formulate a training time minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) resources under a desirable optimality gap constraint.
To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-convex problem, we apply the alternating optimization technique, and propose the bandwidth, batch size, and position optimization (BBPO) scheme to optimize these three decision variables alternately.
Simulation results demonstrate that our BBPO scheme outperforms other baseline schemes regarding convergence rate and testing accuracy.</span></p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have shifted wireless networks from 5G’s connected things to 6G’s connected intelligence, with more stringent requirements for reliability and latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In the pursuit of demanding requirements, federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as a popular distributed framework that trains global machine learning (ML) models at the edge of wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which helps preserve data privacy and avoid long delays caused by data transmission.
Owing to the UAVs’ mobility, UAV-mounted edge devices can facilitate data collection in FEEL.
A typical UAV-assisted FEEL iteration includes <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sensing, computation, and communication</em>, particularly for FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, starting with a common initial model broadcast from the edge server, the UAV-mounted edge devices collect/<em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sense</em> data from the target and use their local sensing data to <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">compute</em> the model updates. Then, they <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">upload</em> their model updates to the edge server for further aggregation to yield an updated global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To fully exploit the benefits of UAV-assisted FEEL, overcoming several challenges associated with UAV deployment and limited onboard resources is crucial.
<em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Firstly, UAV deployment affects the sensing data quality.</em>
Due to practical constraints in sensing range and accuracy, the sensing data quality heavily relies on the sensing channel between the UAV and the target, which is controlled by the UAV position. This in turn affects the accuracy of model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Secondly, UAV deployment affects the communication efficiency.</em>
The transmission rate of local model upload depends on the communication channel between the UAV and the server. As the channel model described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, shorter relative distances and larger elevation angles favour line-of-sight (LOS) communication links. However, this improved communication efficiency leads to a decrease in sensing quality.
Specifically, the shorter the UAV-server distance, the longer the UAV-target distance, resulting in a complex sensing environment, such as dense obstacles, which hinder the ability of UAVs to sense the target successfully.
As a result, the UAV deployment results in a tradeoff between sensing quality and communication efficiency, ultimately impacting the FEEL performance.
<em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Thirdly, the limited onboard energy of UAVs imposes strict constraints on the duration of training.</em>
In order to minimize the training time, it is essential to allocate resources efficiently on both the UAV and server sides.
Therefore, we focus on the UAV deployment design and resource allocation in UAV-assisted FEEL to minimize the training time.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The preliminary studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have mainly focused on implementing classical federated learning (FL) architectures using UAVs. Typically, UAVs are deployed as FL clients with stored datasets, or aerial base stations as model aggregators.
In recent research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, UAV deployment has been integrated into the FL system, enabling UAVs to serve as relays for efficient data collection from other devices, or as aggregators with an adaptive position to enhance the FL performance.
However, <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">these existing studies rarely account for the data sensing process</em>, and assumed that the training data is either already available on the UAVs or can be directly acquired from other devices.
In addition, <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the sensing, computing, and communication processes are highly coupled in FEEL, competing for resources.</em>
While the most relevant study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> investigated the resource management of integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC), it did not include UAV deployment in their problem formulation.
Therefore, we aim to address an open problem of <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">optimizing the UAV deployment and ISCC resource allocation to enhance the training performance in UAV-assisted FEEL systems</em>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel approach for human motion recognition using a UAV-assisted FEEL system.
The system comprises multiple UAVs and one edge server. Each UAV is considered an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) device due to the size, weight, and power constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
In each training round, the ISAC UAVs sense the target and get their local datasets through wireless sensing.
However, due to complex sensing environments such as trees, buildings, and other obstacles, UAVs may fail to sense targets successfully. Therefore, we employ a probabilistic sensing model, where the relative positions of UAVs and targets determine the successful sensing probability.
Only the UAVs that successfully sense the target can update their local models and upload them to the server for model aggregation.
To minimize the total training time, we optimize the UAV deployment and ISCC resource allocation, including bandwidth and batch size design, building upon a partial participation FEEL framework.
We aim to address three main challenges: 1) How does UAV deployment affect the sensing quality? 2) How does the probabilistic sensing model affects FEEL convergence? 3) How can we optimize the UAV deployment and ISCC resource allocation to improve the training performance?</p>

We provide a theoretical analysis of the sensing process for human motion recognition and verify it experimentally.
Our results demonstrate that the sensing quality will reach <em id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a very good level</em> when the sensing elevation angle is larger than a given threshold.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Initial studies on UAV-assisted FEEL focused primarily on implementing classical FL architectures using UAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Typically, the UAVs are deployed as FL clients with stored datasets or aerial base stations as model aggregators.
To fully reap the benefits of the UAV’s mobility, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> have integrated UAV deployment into the UAV-assisted FEEL system, enabling UAVs to efficiently collect data from other devices, or act as an aggregator with adaptive position to enhance FL performance.
For example, Ng <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed using UAVs as wireless relays to facilitate communications between the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components and the FL aggregator, thus improving the accuracy of the FL. Similarly, Lim <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed an FL-based sensing and collaborative learning approach for UAV-enabled IoVs, where UAVs collect data from subregions and train ML models for IoVs.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an asynchronous advantage actor-critic-based joint device selection, UAV placement, and resource management algorithm to enhance federated convergence rate and accuracy.
Additionally, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduced a new online FL scheme to improve the performance of personalized local models by jointly optimizing the CPU frequency and trajectories of the UAVs.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a joint algorithm for UAV placement, power control, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, to minimize the energy consumption of the UAV aggregator and users.</p>

The most related study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> focused on integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) resource management to optimize training performance.

Each UAV is equipped with a single-antenna ISAC transceiver that can switch between the sensing and communication modes as needed in a time-division manner<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>A practical implementation of such an ISAC device via a software-defined radio platform has been demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span>.
Specifically, in the sensing mode, a dedicated radar waveform frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is transmitted. Then, sensing data containing the motion information of the human target can be obtained on board the UAVs by processing the received radar echo signals. This mode is used for UAVs to collect training data.
On the other hand, in the communication mode, a constant frequency carrier modulated by communication data is transmitted. This mode is used for information exchange between UAVs and the edge server.
Our UAV-assisted FEEL system aims to train an ML model for specific aerial sensing applications, e.g., target recognition, using the data wirelessly sensed by the UAVs.</p>

Each UAV switches to the sensing mode and transmits dedicated FMCW signals for target sensing.
We assume that the UAV can only sense the target successfully if it has a LOS sensing link with the target and no obstacles in the link.
Due to the unpredictable sensing environment, we utilize the LOS probabilistic model<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>The formulation and the analysis can be readily applied to other probabilistic sensing models described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span> for sensing.

Therefore, we formulate a resource allocation problem to minimize the total training time by optimizing the batch size <math id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{\delta_{k}\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">{</mo><msub id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">δ</mi><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><set id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝛿</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\{\delta_{k}\}</annotation></semantics></math>, UAV position <math id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{\bm{u}_{k}\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">{</mo><msub id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒖</mi><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><set id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.2">𝒖</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">\{\bm{u}_{k}\}</annotation></semantics></math>, and bandwidth allocation <math id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{B_{k}\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">{</mo><msub id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">B</mi><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1b"><set id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.2">𝐵</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1c">\{B_{k}\}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the UAV deployment design and resource allocation in UAV-assisted federated edge learning (FEEL) for improving training performance.
Specifically, we studied the impact of UAV deployment on sensing quality for human motion recognition. We identified a threshold for the sensing elevation angle that produces satisfactory quality of data samples.
Then, we derived an upper bound on the UAV-assisted FEEL training loss as a function of the successful sensing probability, and showed that the negative impact of data heterogeneity can be reduced if UAVs have a uniform successful sensing probability.
Based on the convergence analysis, we minimized the total training time by jointly optimizing the UAV deployment and integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) resources.
Then, we applied the alternating optimization technique and decomposed this challenging mixed-integer non-convex problem into three subproblems.
Moreover, we proposed the BBPO scheme to alternately optimize bandwidth, batch size, and position, which efficiently computes suboptimal solutions.
Simulation results showed that our BBPO scheme outperforms other baselines in terms of convergence rate and testing accuracy.
