<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has recently emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning approach. Federated learning enables collaborative training of multiple clients and entire fleets without sharing the involved training datasets. By preserving data privacy, federated learning has the potential to overcome the lack of data sharing in the renewable energy sector which is inhibiting innovation, research and development. Our paper provides an overview of federated learning in renewable energy applications. We discuss federated learning algorithms and survey their applications and case studies in renewable energy generation and consumption. We also evaluate the potential and the challenges associated with federated learning applied in power and energy contexts. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in federated learning for applications in renewable energy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Renewable energy generation is projected to grow significantly and make up 38% of the total global electricity production by 2027 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have demonstrated remarkable success in improving the operation of renewable energy plants, power grids, and power consuming assets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The models enable data-driven condition monitoring as well as more accurate forecasts of the power production and operational constraints to inform plant operators, traders, and grid managers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Machine learning can also improve the real-time control of power plants to ensure optimal responses to changing environmental conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Training a machine learning model requires a large amount of past operation data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. An increasing amount of data is being collected to this end. For example, new wind farms may be equipped with sensing and control systems that can generate terabytes of data per day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and modern office buildings can produce hundreds of gigabytes each day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, many power system assets lack representative data for training asset-specific machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Newly installed systems completely lack past operation data to train on. Other systems hardly have any representative training data due to prolonged shutdowns or because software and hardware updates altered the systems’ operation behavior. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A shortage of model training data can, in principle, be mitigated by sharing training data across systems and fleets: For example, a data-scarce wind turbine (WT) may benefit from past operation data of other WTs in the same wind farm or even from the global WT fleet. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Renewable energy systems are largely made up of fleets of distributed power assets capable of generating, transmitting, storing, or consuming renewable energy. In addition to WT fleets, they comprise fleets of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, building technology fleets such as heat pumps, or fleets of rechargeable battery storage. We refer to a fleet as the set of all power system assets. Thus, assets especially within a fleet can benefit from data and models trained on data from similar assets of other operators. For example, an operator wants to train fault detection models to detect early-stage damage. No cases of this damage type have been observed yet at her power plant, so she wants to learn from sensor data of other operators who run similar power plants and which experienced that type of damage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The transfer of knowledge from another system belongs to the area of transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which has been shown to be effective for neural networks in renewable energy applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, however, no data sharing is in place. There is a “lack of data sharing in the renewable-energy industry [which] is hindering technical progress and squandering opportunities for improving the efficiency of energy markets” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The resulting data scarcity inhibits research, innovation and transparency. Operating data of power system assets is usually only accessible to operators, owners, and manufacturers. Many manufacturers seek to maintain control over the data generated by their products and prefer not to make the data accessible as they see business interests at risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Under these conditions, alternative solutions are needed to enable collaborative learning within and across renewable energy fleets.

</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been established as a promising solution to address the lack of data sharing. FL has emerged as an approach for distributed parties to collaboratively train machine learning models in a way that preserves the data privacy of all participating parties. FL achieves this by only exchanging and communicating model parameters but not the participants’ data. FL has already shown successful results and adoption in multiple application areas, especially in mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. It has also already been investigated in numerous applications in the context of renewable energy, as presented in this review. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no survey published of FL applications in the context of renewable energy. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> recently conducted a brief review on its applications in power distribution and transmission systems, it is limited in scope and focused on smart grids.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a technique for collaborative learning of machine learning models by distributed participants referred to as clients. To give an example, a fleet of PV systems, each representing one client, may aim to collaboratively learn a data-driven model for detecting operation faults without exchanging any operation data. The FL training process is iterative and typically involves the clients first locally training a fault detection neural network using only their private dataset, and then transmitting their learned model parameters, i.e., <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">weights</span>, to the server. The server then aggregates the received weights according to a specified aggregation algorithm and distributes its computed model state back to the clients. Iteratively, the server receives, aggregates, and distributes weights such that ultimately all stations receive a <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> FL model, containing fault detection knowledge also from other clients without ever sharing any client’s operation data. This procedure is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Federated learning ‣ A review of federated learning in renewable energy applications: Potential, challenges, and future directions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Thus, FL ensures the privacy of locally stored client data and can provide a viable solution to the lack of data sharing.

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Statistical heterogeneity can be a major challenge of federated learning in renewable energy applications. The participating clients of an FL model training process may differ from each other to varying degrees and exhibit individual characteristics in their training datasets. For example, the participating clients can be batteries from different fleets of battery models and vendors, operated under different operating and environmental conditions. If the clients are residential buildings, they may differ by the highly individual energy consumption patterns across different residential buildings.

This can occur, for example, when there are highly correlated clusters of clients sharing a very similar data distribution. Some clients will then be over-represented in the learned federated model to the detriment of clients exhibiting more unique data distributions. For example, consider learning a control task for clients representing residential buildings, such as heating control. Such a model could be biased towards a group of buildings housing large families (sharing very similar energy consumption patterns) over a group of single households with more individual energy consumption patterns (e.g., night shift workers, mobility workers, travelers).

A main approach is secret sharing, based on splitting the transmitted data of each client in shares. These shares can be exchanged between clients without revealing full information of the data, as all computing operations are only performed on the shares of each client. Results computed on each share can then be aggregated to obtain the equivalent result of computing the same operation on all (non-split) data. This mechanism can be applied to aggregate the model parameters without requiring clients to explicitly share their model parameters with the server.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of clustering-based FL approaches is to build multiple separate federated models (e.g., using <span id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span>), where each model is trained only on a specific subset of clients, called a cluster. These clusters are selected so that the clients belonging to the same cluster are similar to each other. This reduces the distribution heterogeneity within a cluster with the aim of improving the federated learning performance. Various approaches to clustering clients exist. Clustering can be applied using meta-data of the clients (e.g., by geographic location or power capacity) or by clustering depending on model information (e.g., the distance of the local model weights to the cluster’s model weights) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This strict type of clustering can give rise to disadvantages. For example, there is a risk of data shortage within small clusters or too rigid clusters focusing only on part of the relevant information (for instance, a cluster containing only newly installed systems might be subject to time skew) without benefiting from knowledge of other relevant clients. To mitigate this issue, some clustering algorithms propose incorporating parameters of clients from other clusters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. This way, all clusters remain involved in the collaborative training. Fuzzy clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> extends this idea by defining that every client belongs to every cluster to a certain degree, and therefore should be involved in the training of that cluster in proportion to that degree. The fuzzy clustering framework (illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Personalized federated learning ‣ 3 Federated learning algorithms ‣ A review of federated learning in renewable energy applications: Potential, challenges, and future directions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>A) is a promising approach to reduce data heterogeneity while still learning from all clients.</p>

It involves using a pre-trained model learned on the source domain data and then fine-tuning some or all of its layers by training them on the target domain dataset for a few additional steps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While significantly less common, another application of FL has been to create a highly generalized model with the main purpose of alleviating the cold-start problem in machine learning. The cold-start problem occurs when there is insufficient historical data to train a model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>. This is a likely occurrence in renewable energy applications, for instance for newly installed power grid infrastructure which completely lacks representative data for training a machine learning model for condition monitoring. By providing a global FL model to these affected clients at the start of their operations, they can still benefit from an adequate task performance despite data scarcity issues. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> focus mainly on developing such a generalizable model for wind power forecasting, investigating the global FL model performance on wind farms that did not initially participate in the learning process, thereby demonstrating another promising application and benefit of FL.

However, a standard
<span id="S4.SS1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> model (e.g., without personalization) does not necessarily always outperform local models. Indeed, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite> report worse performance with a standard <span id="S4.SS1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> scheme compared to local models.

Personalized FL has been employed to address this issue. An approach based on personalization layers for community-level disaggregation is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>, where specific layers of the model remain community-specific and are not shared with the server.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>, fuzzy clustering is chosen as personalization method, where clusters are based on meta-information (location).

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fault detection and diagnostics is a central task to ensure energy plant uptimes, to reduce maintenance costs, and overall to increase the reliability and cost-efficiency of renewable energy systems. However, an extensive and representative fault database is required to detect and classify faults. Detecting anomalous operation behavior in terms of deviations from the normal state also requires a large, representative dataset of past normal operation data. These requirements cannot always be met in renewable energy applications. For example, a database from a wind turbine with a history of blade damages cannot be adequately used to build a fault detection model for gearbox damages. Data from other WTs is usually needed. With federated learning, the participants in the FL training process can share and obtain exposure to a larger number of fault types or normal operation data, without having to share any data from their systems. FL studies of fault detection and diagnostics applications follow similar principles as in forecasting, with the main goal being to achieve superior performance compared to local models.

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have demonstrated that federated learning methods can be beneficial for overcoming data scarcity conditions as exemplified by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The results reported in previous studies consistently illustrate the superior ability of FL compared to local machine learning models in applications such as forecasting, control, and fault detection and diagnostics. They also demonstrated increased efficiency compared to centralized data sharing settings, and inherent generalization properties of models trained through FL. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning approaches seem particularly suited for renewable energy sectors that involve <em id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fleets</em> of distributed systems that generate, store, or consume energy, and that offer continuous sensor monitoring for the intended FL task. For example, fleets of wind turbines equipped with anemometers (to measure local wind conditions) and accelerometers (to measure vibration responses of critical drive train components) offer the potential to collaboratively learn power forecast models and fault detection models that outperform locally trained models, in a data-privacy-preserving manner based on FL. Similarly, <em id="S5.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fleets</em> of PV systems, smart meters, and vehicle batteries may also benefit from federated learning. The reviewed studies have demonstrated that FL can extract and share information collaboratively across the clients (fleet members) participating in the training. This can be achieved in a privacy-preserving manner where data remains local and inaccessible to other clients, effectively addressing the lack of data sharing and privacy concerns in this field. FL is also a highly flexible approach, shown to be compatible with a wide variety of data types, model architectures, and tasks commonly faced in renewable energy applications. Various proposed extensions to enhance security, efficiency, or model performance further demonstrate the option of adjusting FL methods to specific requirements. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are numerous applications in the field of renewable energy in which the potential of federated learning has barely been explored yet. Examples include predictions of the remaining useful life of equipment, and estimating optimal maintenance schedules in predictive maintenance tasks. Furthermore, the vast majority of applications presented make use of <span id="S5.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> only with limited modifications and do not fully exploit recent state-of-the-art research contributions to further improve FL in practice, especially in terms of data heterogeneity and efficiency. Generally, the choice of framework, algorithms, and extensions is scattered in the presented literature, suggesting a research need for more in-depth comparisons of the applied FL algorithms across various application domains.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is also apparent that some energy-related domains, such as electrical load forecasting of buildings, present a more advanced state of research of federated learning applications than others, such as battery management and control. When planning FL studies, it may be beneficial for researchers in renewable energy application domains less advanced in FL case studies to also take into account previous studies that were conducted on related tasks in other application domains with more comprehensive FL research, such as building load forecasting.

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Challenges, open questions and potential future research directions related to federated learning in renewable energy will be discussed in the following.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The vast majority of studies reviewed employ a standard network configuration based on a centralized server, coupled with a relatively small number of clients. Uncertainties regarding the <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">scalability</span> of the proposed FL method are occasionally expressed across literature, especially concerning scenarios with a large number of participating clients. Only few contributions propose alternative approaches based on configurations with asynchronous, decentralized (server-less), and/or peer-to-peer network structures. In all of these cases, a substantial reduction in communication costs was successfully demonstrated, providing an essential finding which has not been sufficiently considered yet in other studies. Moreover, possible effects of the computational capabilities of clients and their differences on the learning process have not been investigated. The positive results of alternative network configurations provide promising research directions towards a more scalable and efficient use of FL in practical renewable energy applications. Further large-scale studies, based on e.g., more clients and realistic computational capabilities, are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed alternatives. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Statistical heterogeneity</span>, i.e. non-iid data, is a re-occurring major challenge in all application fields in renewable energy. Several studies report that non-iid data, if left unaddressed, negates any performance benefits of applying standard FL frameworks in their case studies, resulting in up to substantially inferior models than locally trained models. Personalized FL is dominantly used with significant success to mitigate this issue. Numerous techniques, mostly based on clustering, personalization layers, and fine-tuning, manage to outperform localized, non-personalized, and even centralized approaches in all presented cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, personalization appears to be a viable solution to mitigate non-iid data issues in renewable energy applications. However, existing studies usually propose only one specific personalization method, lacking its justification and comparisons with other personalization methods. While no personalization method is consistently superior in all applications (section <a href="#S2.SS4.SSS2" title="2.4.2 Customizing FL models to individual clients ‣ 2.4 Statistical heterogeneity ‣ 2 Federated learning ‣ A review of federated learning in renewable energy applications: Potential, challenges, and future directions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4.2</span></a>), comparisons may still be worthwhile and reveal crucial insights on differences across methods. Furthermore, the extent of distribution differences varies strongly across applications (e.g., individual household consumption vs. power generation of a fleet of PV systems), such that an appropriate choice of personalization method (if any) is challenging. It should be noted that this choice may have broader impacts. For instance, clustering or personalization layers affect the cold-start problem, as no single global model is available to distribute to newly joined clients. Additionally, some methods require changes to the framework which require consent of all participants, unlike, for example, fine-tuning which is essentially an optional, local post-FL step.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> is still predominantly used despite these non-iid issues. Alternative algorithms such as <span id="S5.SS2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedProx</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FUALA</span>, which aim to improve convergence and performance with non-iid data, remain largely unused in renewable energy applications. Overall, these results suggest that personalized FL is a very promising and viable solution for renewable energy applications even when faced with significant statistical heterogeneity. The potential benefits of applying alternative aggregation algorithms should, however, be investigated, given the prevalence of this issue.

<div id="S5.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies have proposed weighted variants of <span id="S5.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> motivated by ensuring fairness. However, multiple challenges related to systematic <span id="S5.SS2.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">biases and fairness</span> in renewable energy applications remain unaddressed. For example, the impacts of an over-representation of e.g., systems operated only under certain weather conditions are largely unexplored across applications. Case studies are also lacking with regard to model robustness. Case studies investigating potential performance impacts caused by faulty sensor data are required, also with a view towards practical implementations of FL, yet remain absent. The potential of frameworks such as Agnostic Federated Learning addressing these challenges have also yet to be investigated in renewable energy applications.

This is reflected in the literature with numerous works employing additional privacy mechanisms. A wide variety of proposed enhancements in various combinations is shown to be compatible with FL for renewable energy applications, independently of the task and dataset. Further studies should investigate comparisons of privacy methods in terms of efficiency and their impact on model performance to support decision makers in justifying and choosing appropriate privacy solutions.

<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Framework considerations.</span> The federated learning framework offers flexibility in its selection of the employed aggregation algorithm, communication structure, client selection, or the client training procedure. While numerous different frameworks and modifications of FL have been proposed across renewable energy application domains, a comprehensive comparison is lacking. As the optimal choice of a framework may depend on the application domain and data, a more comprehensive understanding of the performance of these different methods would support decisions of choosing an appropriate framework.

</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the choice of the aggregation, the algorithms discussed in our review and more generally applied in the field of renewable energy are all based on neuron-wise averaging, i.e., they aggregate and average the weights unit-by-unit for each neural network layer. Approaches of federated learning with dynamical network architectures such as Federated Match Averaging (<span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedMA</span>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>), Probabilistic Federated Neural Matching (<span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PFNM</span>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>) or Federated Distance (<span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedDist</span>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite>) account for the various roles each unit plays in neural networks. Federated learning is still a rapidly growing field with new proposed modifications to improve efficiency or performance, and yet recent state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms have remained unused for renewable energy applications so far (including <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedMA</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PFNM</span>, as mentioned above). These algorithms have demonstrated improvements in performance, a reduction in required communication, and they can facilitate the choice of model architecture. Future research studies should investigate if further benefits can be obtained by applying recent state-of-the art FL methods, such as <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedMA</span>, <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PFNM</span>, and others. Moreover, an adaptation of transfer learning methods in a federated learning setting might improve the issue of data heterogeneity and can also be subject of future research.

<p id="S5.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Hyper-parameter tuning.</span> Another challenge in federated learning is the choice of model architecture and hyper-parameter tuning. In general, model architecture and parameter tuning are not dealt with in a federated way, meaning that the appropriate hyper-parameters are usually guessed from observing a single device, such as a single WT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. But decisions based on single local clients may not represent the best global choice. For example, a neural network architecture may easily overfit on local clients with fewer, simpler, or narrowly distributed data, but may underfit the global task across clients. To address this problem, a federated approach to hyper-parameter tuning (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>, <a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>) should be considered and investigated in the renewable energy applications of interest.

<p id="S5.SS2.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Implementation challenges.</span> Processes and policies related to federated learning still need to be defined to enable its implementation in practice. This includes specifying the roles and responsibilities of all actors related to the FL process. Different configurations and role distributions are possible in practice. For example, the federated learning process may be orchestrated by a regulatory entity, which might also define the neural network structure. This regulator could decide on what happens if a client disagrees with aspects of the federated training, for example, the client might be exempt from the training process or required to participate anyways. Federated learning processes can also be implemented and orchestrated by operators to enable data access across the fleet. Federated learning can, in principle, even be implemented by the manufacturer for customers who prefer not to give the manufacturer access to their data. Many research needs and open questions remain with regard to the actual practical implementations of federated learning in renewable energy systems.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Conclusions</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the growing importance of renewable energy in the energy mix, more accurate forecasting, condition monitoring, and control capabilities become crucial. Data-driven models based on deep learning have shown impressive results. However, these models require large and representative training datasets, which are often lacking. While utilizing data from other fleet members within and across fleets can be a solution, it is usually hindered by a lack of data sharing. Federated learning emerged as an approach for distributed systems to collaboratively train machine learning models in a data-privacy-preserving manner. It fully addresses data scarcity and privacy concerns as the locally stored datasets of each participant remain inaccessible to other participants. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous studies have investigated potential applications of federated learning in the context of renewable energy generation, consumption and storage. We have provided a comprehensive review of the findings of those studies. Further, we have discussed challenges relevant to federated learning in renewable energy applications. Our analysis shows that FL can indeed enable privacy-preserving learning and consistently improve models trained on single asset datasets across all renewable energy application fields. As FL incorporates information from multiple assets, participants benefit from e.g., more accurate forecasting (by learning from various geographical locations), improved fault detection (by obtaining a larger fault database), and improved asset control (by learning from consumption patterns of multiple assets). We further note that the flexibility of federated learning approaches allowed researchers to develop approaches customized to specific requirements, e.g., with regard to data heterogeneity or additional privacy needs. Our findings suggest a large potential of federated learning in all considered renewable energy applications. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, many challenges and research questions remain open. One challenge relates to the scalability of FL to larger fleets, which requires further investigation. The robustness and fairness of FL also remain unexplored due to a lack of exploration into potential biases or, e.g., effects of faulty sensor data on the FL performance. While previous studies demonstrated numerous privacy enhancements, a more unified approach with in-depth comparisons is required to support decision makers in choosing appropriate solutions. Statistical heterogeneity has appeared as a major prevalent issue across applications, due to commonly arising distribution differences between client data, such as differences in the technical specifications of the power plant or of individual energy consumption patterns. We find that model customization approaches can successfully mitigate model performance degradation resulting from statistical heterogeneity. Customization techniques have been demonstrated in some cases to be essential when non-customized FL methods are outperformed by locally trained models.

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the prevalence of these challenges, alternative aggregation algorithms to <span id="S6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> which could address these open questions have received insufficient attention. If further research addresses the presented challenges, federated learning may help overcome the lack of data sharing and, thereby, enable more innovation and efficiency in renewable energy applications.</p>
