<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Although Federated Learning (FL) is promising in knowledge sharing for heterogeneous Artificial Intelligence of
Thing (AIoT) devices, their training performance and energy efficacy are severely restricted in practical battery-driven scenarios due to the “wooden barrel effect” caused by the mismatch between homogeneous model paradigms and heterogeneous device capability.
As a result, due to various kinds of differences among devices, it is hard for existing FL methods to conduct training effectively in energy-constrained scenarios, such as battery constraints of devices.
To tackle the above issues, we propose an energy-aware FL framework named DR-FL, which considers the energy constraints in both clients and heterogeneous deep learning models to enable energy-efficient FL.
Unlike Vanilla FL, DR-FL adopts our proposed Muti-Agents Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based dual-selection method, which
allows participated devices to make contributions to the global model effectively and
adaptively based on their computing capabilities and energy capacities in a MARL-based manner.
Experiments on various well-known datasets
show that DR-FL can not only maximize knowledge sharing among heterogeneous models under the energy constraint of large-scale AIoT systems but also improve the model performance of each involved heterogeneous device.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The increasing popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially for Deep Learning (DL), accelerates the significant evolution of
Internet of Things (IoT) toward Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), where
various AIoT devices are equipped with DL models to enable accurate perception and intelligent control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bhardwaj et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Although AIoT systems (e.g., autonomous driving, intelligent control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Samarjit and Faruque, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, and healthcare systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Baghersalimi et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>) play an important role in various
safety-critical domains, due to both the limited
classification capabilities of local device models and the restricted access to private local data,
it is hard to guarantee the training and inference performance of AIoT devices in Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016a</a>)</cite>, especially when they are powered by batteries and deployed within an uncertain dynamic environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cui et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. To quickly figure out the training procedure inference perception of devices, more and more large-scale AIoT systems have the aid of cloud computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, which has tremendous computing power and flexible device management schemes.
However, such a cloud-based architecture
still cannot fundamentally improve the
inference accuracy of AIoT devices,
since they are not allowed to transmit private
local data to each other.
Due to concerns about data privacy, both
training and inference performance of local
models are greatly suppressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a promising collaborative machine learning paradigm, FL
allows local DL model training among various devices without compromising their local data privacy. Instead of sharing local sensitive data among devices, FL only needs to send gradients or weights of local device models to a cloud server for knowledge aggregation, thus enhancing both the training and inference capability of local models.
Although FL is promising in knowledge sharing,
it faces the problems of both large-scale deployment and quick adaption to dynamic environments, where local models are required to be frequently trained to accommodate an ever-changing world.
In practice, such problems are hard to be solved, since classic Federated Averaging (e.g., FedAvg) methods require that all devices should have homogeneous local
models with the same architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">According to the well-known “wooden barrel effect” caused by homogeneous assumption as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1. Introduction ‣ Towards Energy-Aware Federated Learning via MARL: A Dual-Selection Approach for Model and Client" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the energy consumption waste in Vanilla FL is usually due to the following two reasons, i.e., the mismatch between computing power and homogeneous model, and the mismatch between power consumption and homogeneous model. The former uses device energy for waiting time, while the latter uses device energy for useless training time (only enough power to support training but not support communication). Thus,
such a homogeneous model assumption strongly limits the
overall energy efficiency of the entire FL system. This is because energy usages in the entire system are mainly determined by how much power is used in the effective model learning other than waiting, which consumes energy to wait other than training or communication.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, an AIoT system involves
various types of
devices with different settings (i.e., computing power and remaining power).
If all devices have been equipped with homogeneous local models, the inference potential of devices with superior
computing power will be eclipsed.
Things become even worse
when the devices of AIoT applications are powered by
batteries.
In this case, the devices with less battery energy
will be reluctant to participate in frequent interactions with the cloud server. Otherwise, if one device runs out of power at an early stage of the FL training, it is hard for the global model to
achieve an expected
inference performance.
Meanwhile,
the overall
inference performance of the global model will be
strongly deteriorated
due to the absence of such an exhausted
devices
in the following training process.
Therefore, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to fully explore the potential
of energy-constrained heterogeneous devices to enable high-performance and energy-efficient
FL is becoming a major bottleneck in the design of an AIoT system.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although various heterogeneous FL methods (e.g.,
HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Diao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, Scale-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ilhan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, PervasiveFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xia et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>) and
energy-saving techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>
have been investigated to address the above issue, most of them focus on either enabling effective knowledge sharing between heterogeneous models or reducing the energy consumption of devices.
Based on the coarse-grained
FedAvg operations, few of the existing FL methods can substantially address the above challenges to quickly adapt to new environments within an energy-constrained scenario.
Inspired by the concepts of
BranchyNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Teerapittayanon et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and
multi-agent reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>, in this paper, we propose a novel
FL framework named <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DR-FL</span>, which takes both the layer-wise structure information of DL models and the remaining energy of each client into account to enable energy-efficient federated training.
Unlike traditional FedAvg-based
FL method that relies on homogeneous device models, DR-FL maintains a layer-wise global model on the cloud server, while each device only installs a subset layer-wise model according to
its computing power and
remaining battery.
In this way,
all the heterogeneous local models
can effectively
make contributions to the global model based on their computing capabilities and remaining energy in a MARL-based
manner.
Meanwhile, by adopting MARL, DR-FL can not only make the trade-off between training performance and energy consumption,
thus ensuring energy-efficient FL training to accommodate various
energy-constrained environments.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL is good at knowledge sharing without compromising the data privacy of devices in AIoT system design, due to the homogeneous assumption that all the involved devices should have local
DL models with the same architecture, Vanilla FL methods inevitably
suffer from the problems of
low inference accuracy and invalid energy consumption, thus impeding the deployment of FL methods in
large-scale AIoT system designs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Khan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Nguyen et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Xia et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zhu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, especially for
non-IID scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To enable collaborative learning among heterogeneous device models, various solutions
have been extensively studied, which can be primarily
classified into two categories, i.e., <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">subnetwork aggregation-based methods</span> and <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">knowledge distillation-based methods</span>.
The basic idea of subnetwork aggregation-based methods is to allow knowledge
aggregation on top of subnetworks of local device models, which enables
knowledge sharing among
heterogeneous device models.
For instance, Diao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Diao et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> presented
an effective heterogeneous FL framework named HeteroFL,
which can
train heterogeneous local models with varying computation complexities but
still produce a single global inference model, assuming that
device models are subnetworks of the global model.
By integrating FL and width-adjustable slimmable neural networks, Yun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yun et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a novel learning framework named ScaleFL,
which jointly utilizes superposition coding for global model aggregation and superposition training for updating local models.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xia et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, Xia et al. developed a novel framework named PervasiveFL, which utilizes a small
uniform model (i.e., “modellet”) to enable heterogeneous FL.
Although all the above heterogeneous FL methods are promising, most focus on improving inference performance. Few of them take the issues of
real-time training and energy efficiency into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since
a large-scale FL-based AIoT application typically involves a variety of devices that are powered by batteries, how to conduct energy-efficient FL training is becoming an important issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shi et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang and Tao, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To address this issue, various methods have been investigated to reduce the energy consumed by FL training and device-server communication.
For example,
Hamdi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamdi et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> studied the FL deployment problem
in an energy-harvesting wireless network, where a certain number of users may be unable to participate in FL due to interference and energy constraints. They formalized such a deployment scenario as a
joint energy management and user scheduling problems over wireless systems,
and solved it efficiently.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sun et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, Sun et al. presented
an online energy-aware dynamic worker scheduling policy,
which can maximize the average number of workers scheduled for gradient update
under a long-term energy constraint.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, Yang et al. formulated the energy-efficient transmission and computation resource allocation for FL over wireless communication networks as
a joint learning and communication problem. To minimize system energy consumption under a latency constraint, they presented an iterative algorithm that can derive
optimal solutions considering various factors (e.g., bandwidth allocation, power control, computation frequency, and learning accuracy).
Although all the above energy-saving methods can effectively reduce energy consumption in both FL training and communication, few of them can guarantee the training time requirement of FL training within a complex dynamic environment.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, DR-FL is the first attempt to investigate the dual selection by both layer-wise models and the participated clients based on MARL to enable fine-grained heterogeneous FL, where heterogeneous devices can adaptively and efficiently make contributions to the global model based on their computing capabilities and remaining energy.
Compared with state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL methods, DR-FL can not only maximize the knowledge sharing among various heterogeneous models under energy constraints but also significantly improve both the model performance of each involved device and the energy efficacy of the entire FL system.

Since the physical environment is volatile (i.e., high latency network and unstable connection) in real AIoT scenarios, Vanilla FL randomly selects a number of AIoT devices for each communication round of training a homogeneous DNN model.

Although Vanilla FL methods (e.g., FedAvg) perform remarkably in distributed machine learning, they cannot be directly applied to AIoT scenarios. This is because the heterogeneous AIoT devices will lead to different training speeds for Vanilla FL, resulting in additional energy waste, which is unacceptable for an energy-constrained system.</p>

All these heterogeneous AIoT devices can be classified into three categories according to their computing capability, i.e., small, middle and large, where the small, middle and large mean the level of device computing resources and storage resources.
In this paper, the performance of the entire FL system is significantly influenced by three key factors: running time, energy consumption, and model accuracy. Running time determines the training efficiency of the FL system in a real scenario.
Moreover, energy consumption is also a significant factor, particularly for AIoT devices powered by limited energy resources.
Lastly, model accuracy ensures that the system produces reliable and valuable predictions.
Therefore, to optimize the overall performance of the FL system, it is crucial to make a balance between three factors.</p>

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to consider these energy dynamics when addressing the optimization model.</p>

In a heterogeneous scenario, how to effectively leverage the heterogeneity in heterogeneous models and devices to enhance the performance of aggregated models is an urgent issue that needs to be solved in FL.
Furthermore, resource-constrained heterogeneous AIoT devices that participate in aggregation pose a considerable obstacle to the application of energy-constrained FL.
Inspired by the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> where the performance of model inference is affected by the number of successful aggregations for its device, we can deduce that the accuracy of heterogeneous models is proportional to the total number of aggregated models participating in each round.
However, since devices consume energy every time they participate in each round of aggregation, how to reasonably select aggregation devices in an energy-constrained environment to improve model accuracy has become a major challenge in the design of an FL framework.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In DR-FL, heterogeneous AIoT devices and a cloud server cooperate to achieve high performance of various layer-wise models deployed on edge devices. Before training, all devices participating in DR-FL will initialize and install a layer-wise model, which is a subset layer of the global model in the cloud server.
Then, the cloud server sends a part of the global model to AIoT devices for local training. At the end of local training, DR-FL performs layer-wise model aggregation on the cloud server. Note that hot-plug AIoT devices are permissible in DR-FL, where newly involved devices only inherit the parameters of the global model in the cloud server. Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1. Problem Formulation ‣ 4. Method ‣ Towards Energy-Aware Federated Learning via MARL: A Dual-Selection Approach for Model and Client" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the workflow of the DR-FL, which consists of five steps as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">

During the initialization step of DR-FL, each device intending to participate in FL should upload its device information to the cloud, which includes the power, computing, and storage capabilities of devices and the overclocking potential of models.
This collected information is used for energy-aware dual-selection for the layer-wise model and client in subsequent steps to optimize the entire system’s energy efficiency.</p>

After receiving the participating devices’ local model gradients, this step will layer-align averaging (<span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The same parts of the network will be aggregated.</span>) such gradients and use the previous round global model stored on the server to construct a new global model.</p>

Then, to prevent selected devices from dropping out of the FL process due to energy limitations, we design a MARL-based selector that can choose an appropriate model for each AIoT device based on its remaining energy and computing capabilities, which can not only improve the efficiency of the device resource usage but also ensure their active participation in FL (see more details in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3.

Method ‣ Towards Energy-Aware Federated Learning via MARL: A Dual-Selection Approach for Model and Client" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>).
Furthermore, apart from selecting a layer-wised model for each AIoT device, the selector can also adjust the computing capability of AIoT devices, aiming to achieve a trade-off between energy consumption and computing efficiency.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we implemented the DR-FL algorithm using PyTorch (version 1.4.0).
Similar to FedAvg, we assume that only 10% of AIoT devices were involved in each round of FL communication during the training period.
For DR-FL and other heterogeneous FL methods, we set the small batch size to 32.
The number of local training epochs and the initial learning rate were 5 and 0.05, respectively.
To simulate a variety of energy-constrained scenarios, we assume that each device is powered by a battery with a maximum capacity of 7,560 joules.
In other words, each battery capacity is 1500 mA at a rated voltage of 5.04V.
We conducted comprehensive experiments to answer the following four Research Questions (RQs).

This phenomenon shows that it can be used as an effective tuning knob to explore the trade-off between the proportion of cloud validation data and the entire DR-FL performance. We found that the setup validation data ratio of 4% provided a reasonable balance. We picked 4% and used it in all experiments.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is expected to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning among Artificial Intelligence
of Things (AIoT) devices. However, due to various heterogeneous settings (e.g., non-IID data, device models with different architectures) and device resource constraints (e.g., computing power and energy capacity),
existing FL-based AIoT design greatly
suffers from the problems of low inference accuracy, rapid battery consumption and
long training time.
To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel FL framework that enables efficient knowledge sharing between heterogeneous devices under specific energy constraints.
Based on our proposed layer-wise aggregation method and MARL-based dual selection mechanism, AIoT devices with different computational and energy capabilities can adaptively select appropriate local models to participate in global model training, where devices can effectively learn from each other through appropriate parts belonging to different layer-wise models.
Comprehensive experiments performed on well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DR-FL for inference performance, energy consumption, and scalability.</p>
