<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables clients (e.g., hospitals and banks) to jointly train machine learning models without a central orchestration server. In each global training round, each client trains a local model on its own training data and then they exchange local models for aggregation. In this work, we propose SelfishAttack, a new family of attacks to DFL. In SelfishAttack, a set of selfish clients aim to achieve <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">competitive advantages</em> over the remaining non-selfish ones, i.e., the final learnt local models of the selfish clients are more accurate than those of the non-selfish ones. Towards this goal, the selfish clients send carefully crafted local models to each remaining non-selfish one in each global training round. We formulate finding such local models as an optimization problem and propose methods to solve it when DFL uses different aggregation rules. Theoretically, we show that our methods find the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. Empirically, we show that SelfishAttack successfully increases the accuracy gap (i.e., competitive advantage) between the final learnt local models of selfish clients and those of non-selfish ones. Moreover, SelfishAttack achieves larger accuracy gaps than poisoning attacks when extended to increase competitive advantages.</p>

Specifically, each client maintains a <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local model</em>. In each <em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global training round</em>, each client trains its local model (called <em id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">pre-aggregation local model</em>) using its local training data, shares a model (called <em id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">shared model</em>) with other clients, and aggregates the shared models from all clients as a new local model (called <em id="S1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">post-aggregation local model</em>) according to an <em id="S1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregation rule</em>. For instance, when the aggregation rule is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a client’s post-aggregation local model is the mean of the shared models from all clients. In non-adversarial settings, a client’s shared model is the same as its pre-aggregation local model and all clients have the same post-aggregation local model in each global training round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">centralized federated learning (CFL)</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> which requires a central orchestration server to coordinate the training process, DFL has two key advantages. First, DFL mitigates the single-point-of-failure issue by eliminating the reliance on the central orchestration server. Second, in some scenarios, e.g., the clients are hospitals or banks, it is challenging for the clients to agree upon a central orchestration server that they all trust.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our work:</span>  In this work, we show that the decentralized nature of DFL makes it vulnerable to a unique family of attacks which we call <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">SelfishAttack</em>. In SelfishAttack, a set of clients called <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">selfish clients</em> collusively compromise the DFL training process to achieve two goals: 1) their final learnt local models are more accurate than those learnt via DFL solely among the selfish clients themselves (called <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">utility goal</em>), and 2) their final learnt local models are more accurate than those of the remaining <em id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-selfish clients</em> (called <em id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">competitive-advantage goal</em>). The utility goal means that, by joining the DFL training process, the selfish clients can learn more accurate local models; while the competitive-advantage goal aims to gain <em id="S1.p3.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">competitive advantages</em> over non-selfish clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, suppose multiple banks use DFL to train local models for financial fraud detection. A set of collusive selfish banks can use SelfishAttack to compromise the DFL training process so 1) they can still learn more accurate local models than DFL solely among themselves, and 2) their final learnt local models
can detect financial frauds much more accurately than those of the non-selfish banks, gaining competitive advantages. To achieve the goals, SelfishAttack carefully crafts shared models sent from the selfish clients to the non-selfish ones in each global training round. Note that a selfish client still sends its pre-aggregation local model as shared model to other selfish clients, while a non-selfish client still sends its pre-aggregation local model as shared model to other clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our SelfishAttack is qualitatively different from conventional poisoning attacks to CFL/DFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> with respect to both threat models and technical approaches. For threat model, poisoning attacks assume an external attacker who has control over some compromised genuine clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or injected fake clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, while SelfishAttack considers an internal attacker (i.e., insider of DFL) that consists of multiple selfish clients. Moreover, the goal of a conventional poisoning attack is that a poisoned model (e.g., poisoned local model of a non-selfish client when extended to our problem setting) misclassifies a large fraction of clean inputs indiscriminately.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>These are known as untargeted poisoning attacks. We also discuss targeted poisoning attacks in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Poisoning Attacks to CFL/DFL ‣ 2 Preliminaries and Related Work ‣ Competitive Advantage Attacks to Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>.</span></span></span> In contrast, SelfishAttack aims to increase the accuracy gap between selfish clients and non-selfish ones while guaranteeing that the selfish clients still learn more accurate local models by joining the DFL process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Poisoning attacks can be extended to gain competitive advantages (i.e., achieve the competitive-advantage goal) as follows: 1) a selfish client uses a conventional poisoning attack to craft shared models sent to the non-selfish clients so their learnt local models are inaccurate, and 2) the selfish clients only use their own shared models for aggregation so their local models are not influenced by the non-selfish clients’ inaccurate shared models, which is equivalent to performing DFL among the selfish clients themselves. However, as our experiments in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Competitive Advantage Attacks to Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a> show, such attack cannot achieve the utility goal. This is because selfish clients do not leverage any information of the non-selfish clients for aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Since the threat models are different, our SelfishAttack and conventional poisoning attacks also use substantially different technical approaches. Specifically, when extended to our problem setting, a conventional poisoning attack aims to craft shared models sent from selfish clients to a non-selfish one to deviate its post-aggregation local model the most in each global training round. In contrast, we formulate SelfishAttack as an optimization problem, which aims to minimize a weighted sum of two <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">loss terms</em> that respectively quantify two attack goals. Specifically, to achieve the utility goal, we aim to craft shared models sent from selfish clients to a non-selfish one such that its post-aggregation local model is close to its pre-aggregation one in a global training round. Therefore, the non-selfish client still sends a useful shared model to selfish clients in the next global training round, and selfish clients can leverage non-selfish clients’ shared models to improve their local models. Formally, we quantify the utility goal by treating the Euclidean distance between the post-aggregation local model and the pre-aggregation one of a non-selfish client as a loss term. Moreover, to achieve the competitive-advantage goal, we aim to deviate the post-aggregation local model of a non-selfish client. Formally, we quantify the competitive-advantage goal by treating the Euclidean distance between the post-aggregation local model after attack and the one before attack of a non-selfish client as the other loss term.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In a global training round, the selfish clients solve the optimization problem to craft the shared models sent to each non-selfish client. First, we derive the analytical form of the <em id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">optimal</em> post-aggregation local model for each non-selfish client that minimizes the weighted sum of the two loss terms. Second, for aggregation rules such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and Trimmed-mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, we further derive the analytical form of the shared models sent from the selfish clients to each non-selfish one such that its post-aggregation local model becomes the optimal one. In other words, when the non-selfish clients use these aggregation rules, we can derive the analytical form of the optimal shared models sent from selfish clients to non-selfish ones to achieve a desired trade-off between the two attack goals, which is quantified by a weighted sum of the two loss terms. When the non-selfish clients use other aggregation rules such as Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FLTrust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FLDetector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, it is hard to derive the analytical form of the optimal shared models. To address the challenge, the selfish clients use the optimal shared models derived for FedAvg, Median, or Trimmed-mean to attack them.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our SelfishAttack on three datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and Sent140) from different domains and extend poisoning attacks to our problem setting. Our results show that SelfishAttack can achieve the two attack goals. For instance, on CIFAR-10 dataset and when 30% of clients are selfish, the final learnt local models of the selfish clients are at least 11% more accurate than those of the non-selfish ones under SelfishAttack. Moreover, compared to conventional poisoning attacks, SelfishAttack learns more accurate local models for the selfish clients (i.e., better achieves the utility goal) and/or achieves a larger accuracy gap between the local models of the selfish clients and those of the non-selfish ones (i.e., better achieves the competitive-advantage goal).</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional poisoning attacks to FL can be divided into two categories depending on the goal of the attacker, namely <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">untargeted attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">targeted attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These poisoning attacks were originally designed for CFL, but they can be extended to our problem setting.
Specifically, an untargeted attack aims to manipulate the DFL system such that a poisoned local model of a non-selfish client produces incorrect predictions for a large portion of clean testing inputs indiscriminately, i.e., the final learnt local model of a non-selfish client has a low testing accuracy.
For instance, in Gaussian attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, each selfish client sends an arbitrary Gaussian vector to non-selfish clients;
while Trim attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> carefully crafts the shared models sent from selfish clients to non-selfish ones in order to significantly deviate non-selfish clients’ post-aggregation local models in each global training round.
A targeted attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> aims to poison the system such that the local model of a non-selfish client predicts a predefined label for the inputs that contain special characteristics such as those embedded with predefined triggers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Note that our SelfishAttack differs from these poisoning attacks in the following two dimensions.
First, conventional poisoning attacks assume that an external attacker controls some compromised genuine clients or injected fake clients. In contrast, in our attack, we consider an internal attacker composed of several selfish clients.
Second, conventional poisoning attacks focus on degrading the performance of final learned local models of non-selfish clients on either indiscriminate testing inputs or inputs with certain characteristics.
In contrast, in our SelfishAttack, selfish clients aim to gain competitive advantages over non-selfish clients while maintaining the utility of their local models.
Even though we can adapt the conventional poisoning attacks to our context (e.g., gain competitive advantages), they cannot achieve satisfying performance as evidenced by our experiments.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> aggregation rule is commonly used in non-adversarial settings.
However, a single shared model can arbitrarily manipulate the post-aggregation local model of a non-selfish client in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Byzantine-robust aggregation rules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> aim to be robust against “outlier” shared models when applied to DFL. In particular, when a non-selfish client uses a Byzantine-robust aggregation rule, its post-aggregation local model is less likely to be influenced by outlier shared models, e.g., those from selfish clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We formulate SelfishAttack as an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of two loss terms quantifying the two attack goals respectively.
The first loss term quantifies the utility goal, which aims to create shared models sent from selfish clients to a non-selfish client, ensuring that its post-aggregation local model remains close to its pre-aggregation local model. The second loss term quantifies the competitive-advantage goal, which aims to deviate the post-aggregation local model of a non-selfish client. However, the optimization problem is hard to solve because its objective function is non-differentiable with respect to the shared models. To address the challenge, we first derive the optimal post-aggregation local model of a non-selfish client that minimizes the objective function. Then, for aggregation rules such as FedAvg, Median, and Trimmed-mean, we propose methods to craft the shared models sent from selfish clients to a non-selfish client, such that the non-selfish client’s post-aggregation local model becomes the optimal one. In other words, our crafted shared models are optimal for these aggregation rules. When the DFL system uses other aggregation rules, selfish clients can employ the optimal shared models derived based on FedAvg, Median, or Trimmed-mean to attack them.
Finally, we propose a method for the selfish clients to determine when to start attack.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When the aggregation rule is coordinate-wise FedAvg, Median, or Trimmed-mean, we can derive the optimal shared models sent by selfish clients to non-selfish ones. However, it is hard to derive the optimal shared models to attack other non-coordinate-wise aggregation rules such as Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FLTrust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FLDetector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To attack such aggregation rules, the selfish clients can use the shared models crafted based on FedAvg, Median, or Trimmed-mean (we use FedAvg in experiments). Moreover, we tailor our attack to FLAME as detailed in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS4" title="A.4 Attacking FLAME ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Competitive Advantage Attacks to Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.4</span></a>. Although such attack may not be optimal for other aggregation rules, our empirical results indicate that it can achieve decent effectiveness. Note that selfish clients know the aggregation rule adopted by the DFL, so they can decide which method should be used to craft the shared models sent to non-selfish clients.</p>

<p id="S4.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, if selfish clients start to attack
at the very beginning global training rounds,
the non-selfish clients may not be able to learn good local models.
As a result, the selfish clients cannot obtain useful information from the shared models sent by non-selfish clients, making it hard to achieve the utility goal. Therefore, we design a mechanism for the selfish clients to determine when to start attack.
Our key idea is that the selfish clients start to attack in the global training rounds when clients have obtained decent local models.</p>

By default, we assume that a selfish client uses the same aggregation rule adopted by the DFL and all the clients’ shared models for aggregation.

“No attack” means selfish clients do not launch any attacks and just send their pre-aggregation local models as shared models to non-selfish clients.

This demonstrates that our proposed SelfishAttack achieves the utility goal.
For instance, the MTASs of Median and Trimmed-mean aggregation rules under SelfishAttack are larger than those of Two Coalitions on all three datasets.
Note that we do not have this observation for FedAvg and CIFAR-10/FEMNIST dataset. This is because FedAvg is not robust, in which the post-aggregation local models of non-selfish clients are negatively influenced by the shared models from selfish clients too much.</p>

SelfishAttack outperforms GaussianAttack because the latter is ineffective against robust aggregation rules such as Median and Trimmed-mean.
Additionally, when FedAvg is used, the MTAS of GaussianAttack is also very low, resulting in a low Gap.
SelfishAttack outperforms TrimAttack because the selfish clients can still leverage useful information in the shared models from the non-selfish clients to improve their local models in SelfishAttack. In contrast, a non-selfish client obtains an inaccurate local model in TrimAttack and further sends the inaccurate shared model to selfish clients.
As a result, both non-selfish and selfish clients have inaccurate local models, leading to smaller GAPs.</p>

By default, in Step III of DFL, we assume that a selfish client aggregates the shared models sent from both selfish and non-selfish clients. However, we observe from Table <a href="#S5.T1.sf3" title="In Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Competitive Advantage Attacks to Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1c</span></a> that when selfish clients craft the shared models using existing attacks (e.g., TrimAttack or GaussianAttack), the testing accuracy of the selfish clients’ local models is also influenced as well.
This is because non-selfish clients are unable to obtain accurate local models under these attacks.
As a result, when selfish clients take into account the shared models of non-selfish clients during the aggregation process, they also fail to obtain accurate local models.
Therefore, selfish clients can choose to only use the shared models from selfish clients for aggregation in order to enhance their own testing accuracy.
In Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Competitive Advantage Attacks to Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, “All" or “Selfish" means that when performing aggregation, selfish clients use the shared models of all clients or only the selfish clients.
Specifically, selfish clients use the FedAvg aggregation rule to enhance testing accuracy, while non-selfish clients employ the Trimmed-mean aggregation rule to enhance robustness.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We observe that our attack achieves a larger Gap when the selfish clients use all clients’ shared models for aggregation. This is because non-selfish clients still contribute to the local models of selfish clients under our SelfishAttack.
However, TrimAttack achieves a larger Gap when the selfish clients only use the selfish clients’ shared models for aggregation, compared to using all clients’ shared models for aggregation.
The reason is that the non-selfish clients contribute negatively to the local models of the selfish clients under TrimAttack.
Overall, the best attack strategy for selfish clients is to use SelfishAttack to craft the shared models sent to the non-selfish clients and use all clients’ shared models for aggregation.</p>

In our SelfishAttack, we mainly focus on the design of the shared models sent by selfish clients to non-selfish ones. In the experiments, we explored the impact of selfish clients using different aggregation rules and subsets of shared models for aggregation on the effectiveness of SelfishAttack. However, it is an interesting future work to explore how to combine the three strategies, i.e., shared model crafting, aggregation rule, and subset of shared models for aggregation, into a more effective combined strategy.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Defending against SelfishAttack:</span>  Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are defenses against “outlier” shared models, which can be applied to defend against SelfishAttack. However, we theoretically show that Median and Trimmed-mean cannot defend against our SelfishAttack, as the selfish clients can derive the optimal shared models to minimize a weighted sum of the two loss terms that quantify the two attack goals respectively. Moreover, we empirically show that other more advanced aggregation rules such as Krum, FLTrust, FLDetector, and FLAME cannot defend against SelfishAttack as well. It is an interesting future work to explore new defense mechanisms to defend against SelfishAttack. In SelfishAttack, a selfish client sends different shared models to different non-selfish clients. Therefore, one possible direction is to explore cryptographic techniques to enforce that a selfish client sends the same shared model to all clients. We expect such defense can reduce the attack effectiveness, though may not completely eliminate the attack since a selfish client can still send the same carefully crafted shared model to all non-selfish clients. Another direction for defense is to use trusted execution environment, e.g., NVIDIA H100 GPU. In particular, the local training and model sharing of each client is performed in a trusted execution environment, whose remote attestation capability enables a non-selfish client to verify that the shared models from other clients are genuine.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose SelfishAttack, the first competitive advantage attack to DFL. Using SelfishAttack, selfish clients can send carefully crafted shared models to non-selfish ones such that 1) selfish clients can still learn more accurate local models than performing DFL among themselves, and 2) selfish clients can learn much more accurate local models than non-selfish ones. We show that such shared models can be crafted by solving an optimization problem that aims to minimize a weighted sum of two loss terms quantifying the two attack goals respectively.
Our evaluation on three benchmark datasets shows that SelfishAttack achieves the two attack goals and outperforms conventional poisoning attacks.
Interesting future work includes 1) developing combined attack strategies, and 2) exploring new defenses against SelfishAttack.</p>
