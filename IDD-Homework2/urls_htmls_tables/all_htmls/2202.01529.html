<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy preserving machine learning scheme, where training happens with data federated across devices and not leaving them to sustain user privacy. This is ensured by making the untrained or partially trained models to reach directly the individual devices and getting locally trained “on-device” using the device owned data, and the server aggregating all the partially trained model learnings to update a global model. Although almost all the model learning schemes in the federated learning setup use gradient descent, there are certain characteristic differences brought about by the non-IID nature of the data availability, that affects the training in comparison to the centralized schemes. In this paper, we discuss the various factors that affect the federated learning training, because of the non-IID distributed nature of the data, as well as the inherent differences in the federating learning approach as against the typical centralized gradient descent techniques. We empirically demonstrate the effect of number of samples per device and the distribution of output labels on federated learning.
In addition to the privacy advantage we seek through federated learning, we also study
if there is a cost advantage while using federated learning frameworks. We show that federated learning does
have an advantage in cost when the model sizes to be trained are not reasonably large. All in all, we present the need for careful design of model for both performance and cost.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hand held gadgets like mobile phones and tablets have become part of every day life for most of the world population. Over the course of time, these small devices have also become a great source of data, as well as computationally robust units.
Together with the recent abundance of data, both quantitatively and quantitatively, data privacy has become one of the major area of concern. Users would love to have more engaging and personalized experiences with the gadgets, but at the same time will be privy in sharing their data for using it to build better applications. With more and more stricter rules like the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the usage of private data need to be handled with utmost care ensuring minimal privacy leakage. At the same time, the main part of developing any learning algorithm is the existence of data, from which
salient features pertaining to the use-case can be learned.
Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is a recent area of research, where the learning happens with the private data not leaving the
device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting, a shared global model under the supervision of a central orchestrator or server (called aggregator)<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Since the aggregator resides in the server, in the federated learning scenario, we will call it as server, aggregator or central aggregator.</span></span></span> gets trained
by a federation of participating devices.
In a typical FL training environment, a base model is initiated by a server, which is then pushed to the
participating devices. The devices updates the model parameters, individually, in a typical optimization process like
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or mini-batch gradient descent, involving batches and epochs, then returns the
parameter weight updates back to the aggregator. The aggregator then aggregates all the received weight updates and updates the
parameters of the base model. The process is repeated until the model converges satisfactorily with the desired performance criterion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The FL process briefly explained above is fundamentally not the same as the original gradient descent algorithm design. However special
cases of the schemes do match some of the gradient descent variants. Still, there are certain challenges that we face with respect to the learning of models, because of the non IID nature of the data. The typical federated nature of data may introduce new learning challenges like each device having single labeled data or even single sample. In addition, various other factors like number of samples per device, the feature space, the model complexity all have an effect on performance of models trained via federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While considering the infrastructure cost involved in federated learning training, we see that the main advantage of FL is because of its primary security design, that is we need not have to sync the data to a central server<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Syncing data to a central server involves a cost, which may not be negligible. In the case of FL training, the major chunk of the cost involved are related to sending/receiving the model parameter updates to/from the server
aggregator: the more complex the model, the more the number of parameters related to the model that need to be
send by the devices to the aggregator, and hence more the corresponding model update data that needs to be synced to the
central aggregator. More than the cost involved during training is the model deployment cost, which involves not just
the devices participating in the training, but all the devices to which the inference engines has to be deployed. Thus,
keeping the model size under control is essential for reducing the cost in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The another aspect of FL training is security. Although the data is ensured not to leave the devices, we also have to
make sure that the updates are also secure, so as to reduce the chances of inference of data from gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Typical
private AI schemes like differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have been employed in FL
in varying degrees for secure communication of the training updates. However, adding security to the process affects the model
performance or the training duration, thus impacting the cost. As we try to anonymise the data, the more the information loss is and hence lesser or slower would be the learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

The setting involving federation of many edge devices with relatively few data samples per device is called cross-device federated learning. The second setting involving few number of large organisations that themselves act as data centers is called a cross-silo federated learning. An example of cross-silo is medical image classification using hospital data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

In this section, we see the optimization schemes usually employed in federated learning. We see how it is
different from the normal gradient descent based optimization schemes. This will help in understanding the
practical difficulties in federated learning in comparison to centralized schemes.
But first, we will briefly overview the traditional gradient descent schemes, which will help in mapping the federated learning
gradient
descent based optimization schemes more clearly.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In centralized setting, each batch is processed sequentially to update the model. In the federated setting, the data is distributed over clients. As mentioned earlier, two types of gradient updates happen in federated optmization: one done locally at the client side, involving the data present at clients and one at the server side, which involves aggregation of individual client update to update the global model weights. Depending on how the two gradient updates work at clients and server, the optimization in a federated setting may match the centralized setting or could be quite different. However the final goal would still be the same; to minimize the loss of the whole training data.</p>

In other words, devices with unique labels learn weight updates very specific to their attached labels. The server aggregation would consist of aggregating many ”label overfitted” weight updates.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model complexity is an important parameter for any learning task. An optimal model for any problem would decrease both bias and overfitting, and hence generalizes well. The complexity of the models is largely governed by the complexity of the features to be learned from the input. Or in other words, when we have more features inherent in the data, more complex models would suit better. In central schemes, there is not much restriction of the model complexity, in terms of the cost involved in the training. The main cost of training is on the number of compute instances involved and the duration of training. The model complexity is not much of a factor although we could assume complex models to have lengthier training periods.
However there is no communication cost that is dependent on the model.</p>

With these figures, the centralized training cost is <math id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\$1967.90" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">$</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1967.90</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1">currency-dollar</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2">1967.90</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p5.1.m1.1c">\$1967.90</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main factors that affect the FL cost are the message payloads, the weight transfer payloads and training time. The training time determines the time for which the training related EC2 instances have to be kept live. To simplify the analysis, these three factors are captured using three metrics (a) Model size (b) Number of aggregation rounds (c) Number of aggregation rounds per day.
The model size affects data payload, both during training and deployment, number of aggregation rounds affects messages and data payloads, and the training time, the number of aggregation rounds per day affects the time for keeping the training EC2 instances live.</p>

The training cost is almost same in all the cases (525.68, 533.15, 540.85, 48.55 for model sizes ‘15KB’, ‘500KB’, ‘1000KB’, ‘15000KB’ respectively). However the deployment cost takes a huge hit when the model sizes are increased. This is because of the S3 reads that need to be done for all the devices to which the model needs to be deployed. Hence it would be advisable to look for alternative ways of deployment, that does not involve S3 reads, like a FOTA deployment or a release deployment.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The impact of model size on cost also leads to thinking of model size reduction techniques. There are two ways in which model size could be reduced: (1) careful model design including feature set reduction (2) model compression techniques. Many a times, the size of a feature set could have an impact on the model size. For instance, if we are considering bag of words or similar techniques with large vocabulary, then this would increase the size of the model. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> may not be applicable in federated setting, as the entire data is not available for the matrix analysis. Techniques like hashing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> could be utilized for this purpose and the performances are found to be close to the non-hashed features performance. There are also techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> for keeping neural networks compact which not only keeps the models small, but make the learning fast. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> discusses the various techniques in this front.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> proposed a well adopted pruning technique, in which the neural network evolves over time to converge to the best compact neural network.</p>

The cost decrease is because of the reduction in EC2 training instances live period. The more the number of aggregations per day, the less the number of days we need to keep the training instances running. This factor is affected by the per cycle timeout that can be specified by the FL engineer during training. Other factors could also play a role in restricting this number, like shortage of participating devices during certain periods of the day (like work time), the model complexity, which makes each gradient iteration at clients slower, etc.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have looked more closely into federated learning training for non-IID cases, where there is large skewness in labels. We showed a comparison between the different SGD schemes with federated SGD and federated averaging in different data distribution scenarios. We showed that single label per device scenario does not work similar to multi label cases, and care should be taken about the optimal samples used for training. Too many samples with same labels may actually hamper performance. We also showed the cost comparison of FL with centralized schemes and looked at factors that affect cost, viz, model size, number of rounds and number of rounds per day. We showed that in FL, model deployment has a huge affect on cost and product owners need to look how to efficiently manage deployment.</p>
