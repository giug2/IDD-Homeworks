<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage is an essential part of nearly all real-world systems that consume structured and unstructured data coming from different sources.
Typically no common key is available for connecting records.
Massive data cleaning and data integration processes often have to be completed before any data analytics and further processing can be performed.
Although record linkage is frequently regarded as a somewhat tedious but necessary step, it reveals valuable insights into the data at hand.
These insights guide further analytic approaches to the data and support data visualization.</p>
<p id="id3.id2" class="ltx_p">In this work we focus on company entity matching, where company name, location and industry are taken into account.
Our contribution is an end-to-end, highly scalable, enterprise-grade system that uses rule-based linkage algorithms extended with a machine learning approach to account for short company names.
Linkage time is greatly reduced by efficient decomposition of the search space using MinHash. High linkage accuracy is achieved by the proposed thorough scoring process of the matching candidates.</p>
<p id="id4.id3" class="ltx_p">Based on real-world ground truth datasets, we show that our approach reaches a recall of 91% compared to 73% for baseline approaches. These results are achieved while scaling linearly with the number of nodes used in the system.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Enterprise artificial intelligence applications require the integration of many data sources. In such applications, one of the most important entity attributes to be linked is often the company name. It acts as a “primary key” across multiple datasets such as company descriptions, marketing intelligence databases, ledger databases, or stock market related data. The technique used to preform such a linkage is commonly referred to as <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">record linkage</em> or <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">entity matching</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage (RL) has been extensively studied in recent decades. RL is in charge of joining various representations of the same entity (e.g., a company, an organization, a product, etc.) residing in structured records coming from different datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. It was formalized by Fellegi and Sunter in 1969 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and the tutorial by Lise Getoor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> provides an excellent overview of use cases and techniques. Essentially, RL has been used to link entities from different sets or to deduplicate/canonize entities within a given set. To this extent, several approaches have been envisaged ranging from feature matching or rule-based to machine learning approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, RL is performed in batch mode to link a large number of entities between two or more databases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. A challenge of enterprise applications is the ever-increasing amount of unstructured data such as news, blogs and social media content to be integrated with enterprise data. As a consequence, RL has to be performed between structured records and unstructured documents. This large amount of data may flow in streams for rapid consumption and analysis by enterprise systems. For example, if we consider the analysis of news articles, it is not uncommon to have to process about one million news articles per day. If we consider even only one company name per news, we will have to perform at least ten linkages per second in order to preserve the timeliness of the overall application. Therefore, RL needs to be executed on the fly and with stringent time constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we assume that the entities to be linked in unstructured data are identified as mentions by a ready-to-use named entity recognition (NER) module such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
These entities are then passed to RL in a structured fashion in the form of a record containing attributes that, for example, represent company names, locations, industries and others. RL is in charge of linking this record against one or multiple reference datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Reference datasets are typically large and contain several tens (or even hundreds) of millions of records. When matching an incoming record, it would be prohibitive to perform an extensive comparison to each individual entry in the reference dataset. The most commonly used approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is to decompose the reference dataset into blocks by means of a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH).</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Background</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various record linkage systems have been proposed in recent decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. As mentioned in the introduction, they can usually be divided into rule-based and machine learning-based systems. We will discuss a couple of these systems that are most relevant to our current and future work.
Konda <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have proposed a system to perform RL on a variety of entity types, providing a great flexibility in defining the linkage workflow. This system allows the user to select the various algorithms being used at various stages of the linkage process. Despite its flexibility, this approach does not address the performance problem at the center of the class of applications we are addressing.
The <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Certus</span> system proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> exploits graph differential dependencies for the RL task. Even though there is no need for an expert to create these graphs manually, an essential amount of training data is still needed to leverage the graphs automatically. However, we cannot apply such techniques as we consider cases where the amount of training data is very limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Locality-Sensitive Hashing Methods.</span>
In the domain of RL, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) methods are generally used to provide entities with signatures in such a way that similar entities have identical signatures with high probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These signatures are commonly referred to as <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">blocking keys</em>, which denote <em id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">blocks</em>. Blocks are used to limit the number of comparisons needed during the scoring phase, where candidate entities are compared in detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Typical LSH algorithms are <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">MinHash</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <em id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">SimHash</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. MinHash can be parametrized by decomposing the hashing functions in <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bands</em> and <em id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">rows</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The row-band parameter settings for a desired minimal similarity threshold can be determined by the “S-curve” calculation as described in the MinHash literature.
In our current setup, we chose MinHash in order to leverage this explicit computation of the parameters. Moreover it can be tuned for high recall (i.e., to maximize the number of relevant entities), which is a prime requirement for RL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Machine Learning for RL.</span>
A first approach to use machine learning techniques for record linkage was proposed in 2003 by Elfeky et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
A trained classifier approach is compared to unsupervised clustering and to probabilistic approaches. Although the trained classifier outperforms the other approaches, the authors emphasize the difficulty of obtaining training data. More recent studies assess the applicability of neural networks to record linkage, for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. In particular, Mudgal <em id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> show that, compared to “classical” approaches, deep learning brings significant advantages for unstructured and noisy data although it achieves only marginal improvements for structured data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The major limitation to using machine learning techniques for record linkage is the difficulty of finding sufficient annotated training data. This is especially true with company names. Moreover, for each new reference dataset introduced in the system, a specific new training dataset must be developed. To alleviate this problem, some promising approaches such as the use of active learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> have been proposed. However, the application of machine learning techniques to record linkage remains limited at the moment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, machine learning can be applied to sub-problems within record linkage. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning-based technique to extract a short name from a conventional company name. Full company names usually contain many accompanying words, e.g. “ Systems, Inc.” in “Cisco Systems, Inc.”, that contain additional information about a company’s organizational entity type, its location, line of business, size and share in the international market. The accompanying words often vary greatly from one data source to another. For example, some systems will have just “Cisco” instead of the conventional name “Cisco Systems, Inc.”. These are particularly popular in unstructured data sources such as media publications or financial reports, where many company mentions are aggregated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Short company names (sometimes also called colloquial or normalized company names) represent the most discriminative substring in a company name string.
In many cases, when a query company name is very generic, such as “Cisco”, there might be a large set of valid correct matches in a reference database. In order to retrieve all possible matching candidates, it is important to extract and compare corresponding short company names. Short names also allow matching candidates to be found when company names have certain variabilities in both one-to-one and one-to-many linking cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">It has been shown by Loster <em id="S2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> that taking short (colloquial) company names into account is greatly beneficial for company record linkage. However, the company entity matching system described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> used a manually created short company name corpus, whereas in this work we focus on automated short name extraction.
In our deployment, the availability of short company names improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of the RL system, as they lead to smaller and more descriptive blocks and help to give more attention or weight to the most discriminative part of a company name.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, we consider the problem of RL performed on the fly, i.e. dynamically linking an <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">incoming record</em> to records in one or more reference datasets.
A record is defined as a collection of attributes, each of which corresponds to a column in the dataset. Attributes typically include company name, street address, city, postal code, country code, industry, etc. Note that different reference datasets might not contain the same attribute types, and/or attributes might be referenced by different names. For the latter case, we assume that the attribute names are normalized.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The record linkage system essentially comprises three components. One component, <em id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">runtime pipeline</em>, is responsible for matching incoming records against candidate records and returning the best matches. The other two components are used in a an offline mode. These are the <em id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">short name extraction system</em> in charge of training the service to extract short company names and the <em id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">preprocessing pipeline</em>, which prepares the reference datasets.

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use company data from DBpedia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and from a commercial data source describing company hierarchies as our corpus for short name extraction. The commercial data contains information about companies and their hierarchy, where each company location has its own local identifier.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DBpedia.</span> DBpedia contains some 65 K company entities derived from the English version of Wikipedia.
The company entities contain a name, a label and a homepage of a company. We use all these fields to derive a company short name because, in most of the cases, it appears either in the label or on the homepage of a company. For example, a company called ’‘Aston Martin Lagonda Limited” has a label “Aston Martin”. In this and similar cases based on the handful of heuristically devised rules, we conclude that “Aston Martin” is a short name of a company. Similarly, a company called “Cessna Aircraft Company” has a homepage <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">http://www.cessna.com/</span>. Thus, “cessna” is used as a short name for training purposes. After obtaining the short name of a company using its name and homepage, we do additional cleaning in order to exclude the company entity type, such as “.inc”, “corp.” and others. We use the list of business entity types by country provided by Wikipedia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
In order to augment the ground truth data with more values, we use two kinds of transformations: from a name to a short name and from a label to a short name. Thus, we make sure that the system will be able to extract short names correctly not only from the long official name of a company but also from its shorter, sometimes trivial, versions that are often used in free-text sources such as news articles.</p>

This data contains company entities, such as branches, subsidiaries and headquarters, all having individual local and global identifiers. The set of all identifiers associated with a company can be represented hierarchically. Based on these hierarchies, we identify the families of companies which are represented as a tree structure. For each family of companies, we extracted the common tokens of the company names as a short name for the entire family.
After extracting common tokens, similarly to the previous case, additional checks were performed to exclude legal entity types of companies from the token list. The remaining tokens were combined and used as a short name for all the company names in the family. For example, from a family of companies that have two distinct names “ZUMU HOLDINGS PTY LTD” and “ZUMU FOODS PTY LTD”, we extracted “ZUMU” to be the representative short name. Given this data source, we were able to extract 950 K of long–short name pairs for training. In total, more than a million pairs of names were used as a corpus for automatic extraction of company short names.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of commercial company data, the distribution of the number of words within the short and long names is quite different from the DBpedia case (Figure <a href="#S3.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 Short Name Extraction ‣ 3 Record Linkage System ‣ Fast Record Linkage for Company Entities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>). Long names tend to contain more words (3–5 words comprise a large proportion of the probability mass), and short names of only two words are also much more frequent than in the DBpedia case. The task of extracting short names in the case of commercial data is more difficult because the variability of names within the family of companies is greater, and the short name is often the most discriminative part of the name, whereas some other quite discriminative words should be omitted.
For example, for the following family of companies:</p>
<ul id="S3.I1" class="ltx_itemize">

</li>
</ul>
<p id="S3.SS1.p5.2" class="ltx_p">only “SUNSELEX” should be extracted for each of the family members, even though “solar resources” and “solar constructor” are also quite discriminative words for the corresponding company names. On the other hand, there are cases when quite a “long” short company name should be detected. For example,
“Yunhe County Jincheng” from the family “Yunhe County Jincheng Arts &amp; Crafts Gifts Factory” and “Yunhe County Jincheng Wood Industry Co., Ltd.”, where the number of words that should be kept or omitted in order to obtain the short name is approximately the same. As can be seen from the support pie chart in Figure <a href="#S3.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Short Name Extraction ‣ 3 Record Linkage System ‣ Fast Record Linkage for Company Entities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a>, indeed, for the overall corpus, where the commercial company data portion is dominant, the number of words that should be omitted is slightly greater than the number of words that should be kept in a short name.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of the scoring function is to compute <em id="S3.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">(i)</em> the scores related to individual attributes composing the query and reference records and <em id="S3.SS3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">(ii)</em> the appropriate combination of those scores into a single representative score. The individual characteristics of a record require completely different scoring semantics. Moreover, the combination of individual characteristics follow different rules. For example, when combining scores of company name, address, and industry, a weighted sum of the scores is an appropriate approach. Whereas when combining scores of multiple addresses, a maximum over the individual scores is the right approach.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A naïve approach is simply to remove all the diacritics as part of the cleaning step. However, there are company names that are only differentiated by the presence of diacritics. For instance, again from the German language, <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic"> Wächter</em>, <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Wachter</em> and <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Waechter</em> all represent existing but different companies. To tackle this problem, we leverage a property of Unicode representation where diacritics are represented as special combining characters. The combining characters are given a lower weight in the scoring process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge is to deal with legal entity types of companies such as “inc.” or “ltd.”, which may or may not be included in the company name. In our initial attempt, we simply removed these legal entity type identifiers. However, we soon came across companies where the names differ only in the legal entity type but are actually distinct companies. This is one of several occurrences where cleaning had a negative effect on scoring, which confirms the observations made by Randall <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Generally, one approach to alleviate the problem related to special mentions (e.g. legal entity types) is to assign them a lower weight in the scoring process. Therefore we adopted the approach of assigning legal entity types the same weight as a single character minus a small value<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The choice of the actual “small” value is driven by the Levenshtein function implementation.</span></span></span> of <math id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon=1/256" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">ϵ</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">256</mn></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">italic-ϵ</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3"><divide id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3">256</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1c">\epsilon=1/256</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The words in company names can be permuted. For instance, <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IBM Zurich Research Lab</em> and <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IBM Research Zurich</em> denote the same company. This case is covered by the fact that the Jaccard similarity handles permutations.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In some situations, the city name can be included in the company name. For example, <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IBM Research Zurich</em> is sometimes indicated as <em id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IBM Research</em> if it is clear from the context that the geographic region is Switzerland. To handle this, we detect city name mentions in a company name and reduce its weight if the city is in the company’s vicinity. This allows more flexibility with regard to names. To look up city names, we use a fast trie described in the next section.</p>

Words that are part of the short name are weighted higher, namely three times the normal weight. This approach allows us to place more emphasis on the characteristic words of the company compared to other elements present in the name.</p>

The rationale behind this choice is that the Jaccard score allows for word permutations, whereas the Levenshtein score relies on the character sequence.
However, this fact is not well represented by a weighted average.
The reason we do not simply use the maximum between the two
similarities is that, in certain cases, the Jaccard similarity may return a similarity
of 1 for names that are different. This is to ensure that a match
with a Jaccard similarity of 1 is not chosen coincidentally over a
Levenshtein similarity of 1, which is only possible if the strings
are equal. The values of 0.9 and 0.1 have been chosen arbitrarily.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A geographical location is described by means of an address element. This element contains the street address, postal code, city and country code attributes. Each component is scored using a specific algorithm. The street address is currently scored using a tokenized string matching (e.g. Levenshtein tokenized distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>). This provides a reasonable measure between street address strings, especially if street number and street name appear in different orders. Postal codes are evaluated according to the number of matching digits or characters. The rationale behind this approach is that, to the best of our knowledge, the vast majority of postal code systems are organized in a hierarchical fashion. However, this scoring can be improved by using a geographic location lookup service. If the GPS location is available in the reference dataset, the city is scored using the Haversine distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To retrieve the GPS location of the city mentioned in the query record, we use a trie data structure, which contains the names and GPS position of some 195,000 cities worldwide obtained from <span id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">geonames.org</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To evaluate the score, we compute the Haversine distance between cities associated with an exponential decay in <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="[1,0[" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2b"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2.3">[</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2.4">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2.2">0</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2.5">[</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.2c">[1,0[</annotation></semantics></math>. As a fallback, if the GPS position is not available or the city in the query record cannot be found in the trie, we use the Levenshtein score (described in <a href="#S3.SS3.SSS1" title="3.3.1 Scoring Company Names ‣ 3.3 Runtime Pipeline ‣ 3 Record Linkage System ‣ Fast Record Linkage for Company Entities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3.1</span></a>) between city names. Finally, the country code is a simple comparison: If the countries match, the score will be 1. If not, the score is 0.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Industries are typically represented by four-digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Similar to postal codes, SIC industry codes are also hierarchical: The first two left-most digits represent a “Major Group” (e.g. Mining, Manufacturing and others), the following digit is the “Industrial Group” and the last digit is the specific industry within the industrial group. When representing an industry, codes of variable length can be used, depending on the level of generality of the representation. To evaluate the industry score, we use a measure similar to the one used for postal codes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The design of our RL system is driven by three main goals: versatility, speed and scalability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Versatility is given by the generality of the approach. As we have shown in the previous sections, the various components have been designed to be able to accommodate virtually any reference dataset and to perform RL on a large variety of entities. The scoring function set can be extended to other attribute types, e.g. product names, person names, and others. Also, the scoring tree can be adapted to accommodate these new attribute types with appropriate combining functions. The central element of the system is a generic “linker”, which can easily be configured to load a preprocessed dataset and perform linkage. To maximize performance in terms of speed, the linker has been written in C++ and loads the entity database into memory. Therefore, once the linker is started and initialized, all operations are performed in memory. In addition, the linker uses a multi-threaded approach such that asynchronous RL requests can be processed in a parallel fashion to exploit the cores available on the physical system. Each reference dataset and, therefore, the associated entity databases are loaded in a specific linker.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure scalability, we have adopted a containerized approach; each linker runs in an individual container. In conjunction with a container orchestration system, such as Kubernetes, it is possible to run and dispatch linkers on multiple physical machines. This approach allows linear scaling with the number of nodes that are added to the cluster as well as the ability to run linkages simultaneously against multiple datasets. Moreover, the overall system is resilient to node failures, which is an important characteristic for an enterprise-grade application.</p>

19% of the records that have not been matched by Solr, or in other
terms, 79% of the records not matched by the trivial approach. The
reason is that RLS is aware of matching semantics of
different artifacts that compose a company record. The relatively low
precision is explained by the fact that both, Solr and RLS, try to
find a match for every record. The precision for Solr is lower as

dataset mostly mirrors the Swiss dataset despite storing mostly bigger
and international companies that frequently use English words in their
names. Interestingly the trivial matching performs much worse. This
seems to be because the accounting database with 2m records is only
internally available and hence at times uses unofficial name
variations of the company. These variations are mostly trivial and
hence both, Solr and RLS, perform similarly to the Swiss dataset.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we presented the fast RL system for company matching. We showed that the proposed system is able to accurately match about 30% more records compared to the baselines. This improvement is due to two contributions: <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">(i)</em> the introduction of short company name extractions and their use both in the preprocessing phase as well as in the scoring phase and <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">(ii)</em> specific improvements of the scoring function, namely taking into account diacritic characters, legal entity type, and the ability to identify geographic locations in a company name.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, as deployed today in a cluster with three nodes, the system is capable of an aggregated processing time of 17 ms per record, which means that we are able to match approximately 5M records per day. These performance figures scale linearly with the number of nodes, making the system perfectly suited for analyzing high-volume streamed contents.</p>
