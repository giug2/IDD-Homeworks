<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning workflow related to mental health data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) gained popularity in the last few years due to technology advancement. ML and DNN infrastructures can analyse a vast amount of information to predict a certain case <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Canziani <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Holzinger <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. DNN is a part of ML that tries to replicate a human’s brain neurons’ functionalities to achieve a prediction. This analysis and prediction functionalities can deal with complex problems that were previously considered to be unsolvable. ML predictions become more valuable when the analysis involves highly sensitive private data such as health records. Consequently, data holders cannot simply share their private data with ML algorithms and experts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chen and Zhao (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. Many defensive techniques proposed in the past as countermeasures to the information leakage of sensitive data, such as anonymisation and obfuscation techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Other research focused on non-iterative Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches for data security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tkachenko and Izonin (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Izonin <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Nevertheless, due to the advancement of technology, similar techniques cannot anymore guarantee the privacy of the underlying data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hall <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Ahmad <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Malicious users are able to reverse and reconstruct, anonymised and obfuscated data, in order to identify the identities of the data subjects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is common knowledge that data is the most valuable asset of our century. Since ML algorithms require vast amounts of it, it is frequently targeted by malicious parties. Several attacks exist that can hack, reconstruct, reverse or poison ML algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Coordinated by TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. The common goal of these attacks is to identify the underlying data. Several of them require access during the ML algorithm training to succeed, while others are able to interfere later in the testing or publication phase. In the literature, there are several defensive methods and techniques proposed against the aforementioned mistreats. However, when reinforcing a ML algorithm with security and privacy features against adversarial attacks, there is an impact on efficiency, thus ending up with the produced predictions not related to the associated tasks and with often a lower accuracy. Hence, a balance between tolerable defence and usability is a critical point of interest that many researchers are trying to solve. Most of the aforementioned attacks are applicable and target centralised ML infrastructures, in which the model owners have access and acquire all the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Muñoz-González <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the importance of the ML field and the associated privacy risks, a new division of ML was created, namely Privacy-Preserving ML (PPML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Al-Rubaie and Chang (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. This area is focused on the advancement and development of countermeasures against information leakage in ML, by shedding light on the privacy of the underlying data subjects. When a few of these ML risks and attacks were introduced, they were purely theoretical; hence, due to the rapid advancement and evolution of ML, attackers led to the exploitation of those weaknesses in order to breach, steal, and profit from this data. Several techniques and countermeasures were proposed in the PPML field. It is a common belief that if data never leave their holders possession to be used from a ML algorithm, then the data privacy is higher. The most extended and researched area related to this is Federated Learning (FL)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Konečnỳ <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Bonawitz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Ryffel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In a FL scenario, the ML model owners are able to send their model to the data holders for training. From a high-level perspective, this scenario is secure; however, there are still many security flaws that need to be solved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. For example, the ML model owners could reverse their model and identify the underlying training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fredrikson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. A suggested solution is to use a secure aggregator, often an automated procedure or program, as a middle-ware, which aggregates all the participants’ trained models and then sends the updates to the ML model owners <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. This solution is robust against several attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fredrikson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>); Song <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Shokri <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Salem <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, but still involves issues, such as the possibility of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack that is able to interfere and trick both parties or even the scenario where one or more participants are malicious. In the latter scenario, malicious data providers can poison the ML model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bagdasaryan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Bhagoji <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> in order to miss-classify specific predictions in its final testing phase; thus, the ML model owner could never distinguish a poisoned model from a benign. This model poisoning scenario could happen in a healthcare auditing scheme, where the trusted auditing organisation uses a ML algorithm to audit other healthcare institutions to predict financial profits and losses in the future. A potential malicious healthcare institution is able to poison the ML model using indistinguishable data that could lead to false predictions from the final trained model by miss-classifying the economic losses of the healthcare institution and approve its operation, as usual.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned attacks share some common issues and concerns such as the lack of trust between the participating parties, or the lack of a secure communication channel to transmit private ML model updates. In this work, we redefine the privacy and trust in federated machine learning by creating a Trusted Federated Learning (TFL) framework as an extension of the privacy-preserving technique to facilitate trust amongst federated machine learning participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Abramson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. In our scheme, the ML participants need to get a certification before their participation, from a trusted governmental body such as the National Health Service (NHS) Trust in the United Kingdom. Following, the ML training procedure is distributed among the participants similarly to FL. The main difference is that the model updates are being sent through a secure communication end-to-end encrypted channel. Before learning commences, the respective parties must authenticate themselves against some predetermined policy. Policies can be flexibly determined based on the ecosystem, trusted entities and associated risk; this paper gives an example of using a healthcare scenario. The proof-of-concept developed in this paper is built using open-source Hyperledger technologies such as Aries/Indy/Ursa <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hyperledger (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">c</a>)</cite> and developed within the PyDentity-<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Aries FL</span> project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">OpenMined (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite> of the OpenMined open-source privacy-preserving machine learning organisation.

The implementation enables participating entities mutually authenticate digitally signed attestations (Credentials), issued by trusted entities specific to the use-case. The presented authentication mechanisms could be applied to any regulatory workflow, data collection, and data processing and are not limited solely to the healthcare domain.

DIDs can be controlled solely by their owners and grant a person the ability to be authenticated similar to a login system, but without relying on a trusted third-party company. Consequently, DIDs are often stored in distributed ledgers such as blockchain ledgers, which are not managed by a single authority. Distributed storage systems such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and Sovrin ledgers, or InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) are often used to store DID specifications, each with their own resolution method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">W3C Credential Community Group (<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.

Docker containers are lightweight, autonomous, virtualised systems similar to virtual machines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Smith and Nair (<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>. The main difference between virtual machines is that Docker containers use the host’s underlying operating system and bridge the network traffic in a virtual network card instead of being fully isolated. Moreover, Docker containers are being developed into deployable images that are executed and operate as expected invariably in any system that supports the Docker environment. Hence, applications that could be built using Docker containers are favourable for reproducibility and code replication purposes.

Opposed to centralised ML, in a FL scenario, the training data remain at their respective owners instead of transmitting to a central location to be used by a ML practitioner. There are several FL variations such as Vanilla FL, Trusted Model Aggregator, and Secure Multi-Party Aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Abramson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Bonawitz <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Kholod <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Consequently, the ML model is primarily distributed among the data holders, who train it using their private data, and then send it back to the ML model owner. ML training decentralisation permits data holders with sensitive data such as healthcare institutions to train useful ML algorithms to predict a cure or a disease. One of the FL advancements, namely Secure Multi-Party Aggregation, developed to further enhance the system’s security by encrypting the models into multiple shares and aggregating all the trained models to eliminate the possibility of a malicious ML model owner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Das <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Ryffel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

The credential schema and the DIDs of the credential issuers are written to a public ledger; we used British Columbia VON’s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Government of British Columbia (<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> development ledger.</p>

After the authentication is completed, the Researcher can initiate a FL mechanism, in which the ML model is being sent encrypted to each Hospital from the list of approved connections sequentially. Each Hospital trains this model using its mental health dataset and sends the model back to the Researcher. Then, the Researcher validates the trained model using its validation dataset and sends it to the next Hospital. The presented procedure continues until all the participants train the ML model. At the end of the training, the Researcher holds a ML model trained by multiple Hospitals that validated using its validation dataset to calculate the model’s accuracy and loss. The model’s parameters and updates are being sent using the DIDComm transport protocol, the security and performance evaluation of it have been presented and discussed in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

Each participating entity is configured as a Docker container instead of a real-world situation in which each participant would run on their own network. Communication between entities only happens using the DIDComm protocol adding an authenticated encryption layer (see Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Decentralised Identifiers Communication Protocol ‣ 2.2 Decentralised Identifiers ‣ 2 Background Knowledge and Related Work" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) on top of the underlying transport protocol, in this case, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) at a specified public port. Internally the entity can be represented as a controller and an agent; the controller sends HTTP requests to the agent defined by the admin-API. Received requests act as commands often resulting in the agent sending a DIDComm protocol message to an external agent, for example issuing a credential. Agents that receive a message from another entity post a webhook internally over HTTP, allowing the controller to respond appropriately. Note this can include requesting the agent to send further messages in reply. More details can be seen in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Communication Protocol ‣ 3 Implementation Overview" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Table <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Communication Protocol ‣ 3 Implementation Overview" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

Before the training, the Researcher holds a ML model and a validation dataset, and each Hospital holds its own training dataset. The datasets are from an open-source mental health survey that “that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD (<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, which are pre-processed into appropriate training data and validation data; the original dataset split into four partitions, three training datasets, one for each Hospital and one validation dataset for the Researcher.</p>

Hence, the training process involves only authenticated Hospitals and Researchers that communicate through encrypted channels. Our work does not prevent the aforementioned attacks from happening; however, it minimises the possibility of occurring by establishing a trust framework among the participants. Malicious entities could be checked on their registration to the system and removed on ill behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A potential threat in our test environment is the possibility of the participants’ computer systems getting compromised. In such scenarios, the trusted credential issuers could create legitimate credentials to malicious participants, or a compromised hospital could corrupt the ML training; both scenarios lead to a malicious participant controlling a valid VC for the infrastructure. Another concern is the possibility that a compromised participant may try a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lau <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite>, which can be mitigated by setting a timeout process within each participant, after several unsuccessful invitations. Several cybersecurity procedures could be in-place within the participants’ computer systems that make security concerns and breaches unlikely. OWASP provides several secure practices and guidelines in order to mitigate cybersecurity threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">OWASP (<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>; hence, further defensive mechanisms could be used to extend further the security of the system, such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hall (<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. However, this type of attack is out of the scope of this paper.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate our proof-of-concept’s security, we created malicious agents that attempt to take part in the ML procedure by connecting to one of the trusted credential issuers. Any agent without the appropriate VCs, either a verified Hospital or an audited Researcher credential, could not establish an authenticated channel with the other party, as seen in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 Establishing Trust ‣ 3 Implementation Overview" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The unauthorised connection requests and the self-signed VC are automatically being rejected. The reason is because they had not been signed by a trusted authority whose DID was known by the entity requesting the proof. The mechanism of the mutual authentication of the VC between participants is not domain-specific to ML and can be expanded to any context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Abramson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

Only in case that the Hyperledger Aries agent and controller reside within the same Docker container, then the information related to the connection establishment sent internally in plain <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">.json</span> format (Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Security Testing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>, Figure <a href="#A1.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ Appendix A Security Testing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>). However, this finding is irrelevant in production environments since each participant, its controller and agent would be physical machines or private networks and not Docker containers. We demonstrated this separation of controllers and agents, by executing each one in their own respective Jupyter Notebook <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kluyver <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, as described in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Communication Protocol ‣ 3 Implementation Overview" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, other critical findings were observed during the training procedure. All the traffic was fully encrypted between all the parties, in each stage of the FL training (Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Security Testing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>, Figure <a href="#A1.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Appendix A Security Testing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>). We used unsuccessfully various cybersecurity tools such as the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) CyberChef <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">GCHQ (<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite> in order to reverse the encrypted content and obtain some information about the training data or the ML model. That is re-assuring since the traffic related to the training procedure may contain information about the sensitive underlying training data.</p>

Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>a) shows the CPU usage of each agent involved in the learning workflow. The CPU usage of the Researcher raises each time it sends the model to the Hospitals, and the CPU usage of the Hospitals raises when they train the model with their private data. This result is expected and follows the execution of <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ 3.3 Federated Learning Procedure ‣ 3 Implementation Overview" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a></span> successfully.

The main difference is that since the Researcher averages and validates each model against the training dataset every time, the memory and network bandwidth increase over time.

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our work aims to demonstrate that since the proposed trust framework is distributed, it is possible to establish a FL workflow. Therefore, we do not focus on improving this FL process and tuning the hyperparameters for more reliable predictions, apart from developing the FL libraries designed for this purpose. The FL training procedure consists of the following hyperparameters: learning rate of 0.01 for 10 training epochs using one-third of the training dataset in batches of size 8. Moreover, we present the ML model’s confusion matrix using the Researcher’s validation data after each federated training batch, as shown in Tables <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a> and <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we extended our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Abramson <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> by merging the privacy-preserving ML field with VCs and DIDs while addressing trust concerns within the data industry. These areas focus on people’s security, privacy and especially on the protection of their sensitive data. In our work, we presented a trusted FL process for a mental health dataset distributed among hospitals. We proved that it is possible to use the established secure channels to obtain a digitally signed contract for ML training or manage pointer communications on remote data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ryffel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

More specifically, as described in Section <a href="#S4.SS1.SSS1" title="4.1.1 Security Testing ‣ 4.1 Security Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1.1</span></a>, each participant’s controller and agent entities are separated into their own isolated Docker containers. That separation is adjacent to a real-world scenario in which each controller and agent reside in different systems (Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Security Testing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>). Furthermore, in our technical codebase, we now use our novel libraries written in Python programming language and demonstrated thoroughly
using Jupyter notebooks. We further performed an extensive security and performance evaluation in each stage of our proposed infrastructure, which was lacking in our previous work, and our findings are presented in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The performance metrics identified that the performance of our trusted FL procedure and the accuracy of the ML model are similar, albeit the model is transmitted through the encrypted DIDcomm protocol. Additionally, using our designed FL libraries, the ML training process completes faster. It should be noted that there are no conflicts with other defensive methods and techniques, and they could be incorporated into our framework and libraries.</p>

<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While FL is vulnerable to attacks as described in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Security Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, the purpose of this work is to develop a proof-of-concept for the demonstration that distributed ML can be achieved through the same encrypted communication channels used to establish domain-specific trust. We exhibited how this distributed trust framework could be used by other fields and not FL explicitly. This will allow the application of the trust framework to a wide range of privacy-preserving workflows. Additionally, it allows us to enforce trust, mitigating FL attacks using differentially private training mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dwork (<a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Abadi <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Mironov (<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Various techniques can be incorporated to our framework in order to train a differentially private model; such as Opacus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">PyTorch (<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, PyDP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">OpenMined (<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, PyVacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Waites (<a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and LATENT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chamikara <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. To reduce the model stealing and training data inference risks, the SMPC can be leveraged to split data and model parameters into shares <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lindell (<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our proof-of-concept detailed the established architecture between three hospitals, a researcher, a hospital trust and a regulatory authority. Firstly, the hospitals and the researcher need to obtain a VC from their corresponding trust or regulatory authority, and then follow a mutual authentication process in order to exchange information. Further, the researcher instantiates a basic FL procedure between only the authenticated and trusted hospitals, we refer to this process as Vanilla FL, and then transmits the ML model through the encrypted communication channels using Hyperledger Aries framework. Each hospital receives the model, trains it using their private dataset and sends it back to the researcher. The researcher validates the trained model using its validation dataset to calculate its accuracy. One of the limitations of this work is that the presented Vanilla FL process acts only as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that FL is possible through the encrypted DIDComm channels. However, to incorporate it in a production environment, it should be extended and introduce a secure aggregator entity, placed in-between the researcher and the hospitals that would act as a mediator of the ML model and updates. In that production environment, the researcher entity would simultaneously send the ML model to all the authorised participants and not have a validation dataset. This is a crucial future improvement we need to undertake to help the research community further. Another potential limitation of our work is training a large-scale convolutional neural network, which left as out-of-scope, but needs to be tested.</p>
