<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">In contemporary rural healthcare settings, the principal challenge in diagnosing brain images is the scarcity of available data, given that most of the existing deep learning models demand extensive training data to optimize their performance, necessitating centralized processing methods that potentially compromise data privacy. This paper proposes a novel framework tailored for brain tissue segmentation in rural healthcare facilities. The framework employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment in tandem with a refinement model (RM) deployed locally at rural healthcare sites. The proposed DRL model has a reduced parameter count and practicality for implementation across distributed rural sites. To uphold data privacy and enhance model generalization without transgressing privacy constraints, we employ federated learning (FL) for cooperative model training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training the network with a limited data set and observing a substantial performance enhancement, mitigating inaccuracies and irregularities in segmentation across diverse sites. Remarkably, the DRL model attains an accuracy of up to 80%, surpassing the capabilities of conventional convolutional neural networks when confronted with data insufficiency. Incorporating our RM results in an additional accuracy improvement of at least 10%, while FL contributes to a further accuracy enhancement of up to 5%. Collectively, the framework achieves an average 92% accuracy rate within rural healthcare settings characterized by data constraints.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multiple prognostic assessments anticipate a nationwide deficiency in geriatricians and neurologists in the United States, with the most pronounced impact expected to be experienced within rural healthcare settings over the ensuing decades<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> present, 20 states have been designated as ’dementia neurology deserts,’ characterized by a projected availability of fewer than 10 neurologists per 10,000 residents by the year 2025<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In addressing the insufficiency of specialized medical practitioners for diagnostic purposes in rural sites. However, the efficacy of deep learning hinges on the availability of relevant training data. It has been documented that diagnostic prevalence remains lower in rural counties compared to urban counterparts, and the persistent challenge of low patient volume in rural communities further complicates the application of deep learning methodologies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, collecting data from rural healthcare sites at a central urban healthcare site can facilitate model training. However, the absence of data privacy would ensue if data were centralized within an urban location thereby contravening established data privacy protocols and concurrently augmenting expenditures attributable to the imperative need for physical transportation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One potential solution issue mentioned above issue involves the implementation of edge computing, wherein the machine learning model is trained locally at each rural healthcare institution using the data available at that specific site <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, it is essential to emphasize that achieving superior accuracy in model training necessitates access to a substantial volume of data. This resource may not be readily available at all healthcare institutions due to computational constraints. To address this challenge, an alternative approach involves the utilization of cloud computing, where the model is trained on a remote cloud server using data collected from various local sites. Cloud computing is utilized for applications and services over the Internet, along with the underlying software and hardware infrastructure that supports these services within data centers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge adoption of cloud computing introduces potential concerns related to data privacy and security, which warrant careful consideration in the context of healthcare applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For these issues currently afflicting rural hospitals in the United States, federated learning (FL) presents a potential remedy. The process of federated learning involves the periodic collection of locally trained models from individual healthcare sites or hospitals<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The objective is to derive shared global contributions from all participating sites<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. After the aggregation of these local models, the resultant global model is broadcast back to the individual sites for ongoing training. This decentralized approach facilitates collaborative model training across multiple sites while safeguarding the privacy of local data, thus effectively addressing privacy concerns<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This collaborative multi-site model training approach holds the potential to enhance model generalization compared to single-site models. This improvement stems from the inherent diversity in the data from various rural healthcare institutions. Consequently, this approach can provide substantial benefits to rural sites that may have limited patient training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To assist medical personnel, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is broadly applied for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes due to its information abundance and non-invasive technology approach. In MRI images, different modalities have been developed to capture specific anatomical characteristics. These modalities exhibit distinctions in terms of contrast and functionality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Three commonly referenced modalities are T1 (associated with spin-lattice relaxation), T2 (associated with spin-spin relaxation), and T2-flair (pertaining to fluid attenuation inversion recovery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Semantic segmentation does the crucial task of categorization and the identification of diseased tissues by assigning class labels to each pixel in an MRI image. Many algorithms and techniques have been developed so far for tissue segmentation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Deep learning has recently made significant strides in medical image segmentation, with successful outcomes observed in both 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for MRI image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. To achieve higher output accuracy, these models need to be trained on large data sets. Unfortunately, for individual institutions, the acquisition and processing of large data sets can be challenging due to cost constraints, computational complexity, and patient medical records privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we present an innovative MRI segmentation architecture for local healthcare sites using FL and DRL approaches. Unlike previous deep learning models, our proposed model can achieve improved results for rural healthcare sites even when trained with a limited number of subjects. Our approach involves a two-stage segmentation model comprising coarse segmentation and refinement model. The DRL environment enables segmentation and coarse segmentation generation with a reduced number of model parameters. DRL actions are defined as threshold levels that generate thresholds for the input MRI image, addressing the overlap between the intensity levels of WM and GM to produce coarse segmentation. The refinement network is capable of adjusting both local and global boundaries and then enhances the edges of the DRL output.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For subsequent rounds, the broadcasted parameters are once again employed for local training at each rural site and subsequently forwarded to the central cloud-based server. This iterative process continues for several rounds, ultimately yielding the final parameters utilized across all participating local sites. It is noteworthy that, in this framework, only the model parameters are shared with the cloud server, whereas the actual data from each local site remains unshared. This approach is devised to uphold the stringent data privacy policies enforced by institutional sites. Moreover, the models employed at the rural sites are characterized by their compact size, resulting in a reduced parameter footprint in contrast to the conventional deep learning models. This attribute renders the framework amenable to edge computing environments.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It should be emphasized that the data set has been partitioned in such a manner that certain rural institutional sites are furnished with significantly fewer training data points compared to the quantities typically employed in training deep learning models. The goal of this framework is to achieve heightened accuracy, even when dealing with sites possessing a limited volume of patient data. This emphasis on performance improvement is particularly pertinent given the primary focus of the framework on rural healthcare institutions.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce ThreshNet, a novel automated threshold generation system designed for threshold segmentation tasks. ThreshNet’s core component is a DRL agent as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Cloud-based Federated Learning Framework for MRI Segmentation This work is supported by West Virginia University, Faculty Startup Grant (PI: A. El-Wakeel)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, complemented by an off-the-shelf threshold segmentation process. The system operates as follows: an MRI image and a blank mask image are concatenated and input into the DQN model. The DQN then suggests new threshold levels based on these inputs (Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B2 ThreshNet ‣ II-B Proposed Framework ‣ II Framework and Methodology ‣ Cloud-based Federated Learning Framework for MRI Segmentation This work is supported by West Virginia University, Faculty Startup Grant (PI: A. El-Wakeel)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), which are used to compute upper and lower threshold values. Subsequently, a threshold-based segmentation is applied to generate a new binary mask. This binary mask serves a dual purpose: it is used to compute rewards by comparing it to the ground truth mask and also serves as an observation for the subsequent iteration. During training, ThreshNet iteratively performs this cycle, while during testing, only the threshold generation procedure is executed. The final segmentation masks are obtained by repeating the threshold generation process three times for each input MRI image and performing threshold segmentation accordingly.</p>

This architectural framework is distinguished by its adaptability, rendering it applicable across a spectrum of resolutions without necessitating the intricate task of fine-tuning its parameters. Furthermore, to render the cascadePSP architecture conducive to edge computing within the confines of rural healthcare facilities, we undertook a parameter reduction initiative. In the original architecture, the ResNet-50 module was employed; however, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B2 ThreshNet ‣ II-B Proposed Framework ‣ II Framework and Methodology ‣ Cloud-based Federated Learning Framework for MRI Segmentation This work is supported by West Virginia University, Faculty Startup Grant (PI: A.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We developed a system that encompasses three rural healthcare sites. The analyzed subjects were distributed among these rural sites. Our primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of these rural sites while training them with a smaller number of subjects, utilizing FL. We conducted two experiments involving varying numbers of subjects distributed across rural healthcare sites. In the first experiment, we allocated 10 subjects to site 1, 4 subjects to site 2, and 4 subjects to site 3. For the second experiment, we evenly distributed 6 subjects to each of the three sites. For this experiment, we extracted 2D images from the MRI scans and allocated 80 percent for training and 20 percent for testing. In the context of performance assessment, we employed the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as metrics.</p>

This environment simulates a scenario where no information or parameter is shared with other healthcare sites, allowing us to evaluate the model’s performance in isolation. At each rural site, the model is trained using local data. We employed the early stopping method to halt the training process at all sites.

Specifically, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the DSC scores predominantly range from 70% to 80%, signifying the necessity for refinement. In Experiment 1, the DSC score for Site 1, featuring 10 subjects, exhibited a notable enhancement from 76% to 94%, a pattern observed across other sites as well. Meanwhile, in Experiment 2, where subject numbers were equitably distributed (6 subjects per rural site), DSC scores demonstrated marked improvement, increasing from an average of 77% to as high as 93%. Consequently, it is reasonable to deduce that the proposed framework, combining DRL and a refinement model, is well-suited for healthcare sites with a limited number of patients. This finding implies that rural healthcare facilities need not share patient data for further processing or diagnostic purposes utilizing segmentation models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the second training method, during the training stage of FL, initial local model training takes place. Subsequently, the parameters undergo transmission to the server and are aggregated. The aggregated results are then broadcasted back to the local healthcare sites. This iterative process continues until saturation is observed in the aggregated training error. Specifically for our training approach, prior to transmitting the parameters to the server, we conduct model training for 10 epochs in each iteration. Following the reception of aggregated parameters, the training for 10 epochs is reiterated, and error monitoring takes place after each iteration of the parameters’ broadcast.</p>

Notably, the performance of the DRL model following FL training exhibits minimal alteration, with segmentation DSC maintaining a consistent range between 70% and 80%, while Sensitivity, Specificity, and MAE exhibit uniformity across all sites for the DRL model alone.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our study presents an innovative segmentation framework tailored for federated learning applications within healthcare settings characterized by a restricted pool of subjects. This framework incorporates a DRL model capable of executing adaptive threshold-based segmentation, which is subsequently refined using RM to enhance the precision of coarse segmentation. This novel approach exhibits promise in segmentation with accuracy up to 92% - 95% for healthcare sites in rural areas that contend with limited data resources, all while preserving data privacy. Importantly, our model contributes to the reduction of computational complexity with a three times reduction in parameters than other segmentation models in the context of brain tissue segmentation without compromising the accuracy of the segmentation process. As we look toward the future, the ongoing development of this research will entail expanding our analysis to encompass larger data sets and incorporating multiple rural healthcare sites, employing various federated learning frameworks, and extending the scope to encompass the segmentation of all three tissue types in brain MRI scans.</p>
