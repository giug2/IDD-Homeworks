<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To efficiently exploit the massive amounts of raw data that are increasingly being generated in mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning technique by collaboratively training a shared learning model on edge devices.
The number of resource blocks when using traditional orthogonal transmission strategies for FL linearly scales with the number of participating devices, which conflicts with the scarcity of communication resources. To tackle this issue, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged recently which leverages the inherent superposition property of wireless channels to perform <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one-shot</span> model aggregation. However, the aggregation accuracy in AirComp suffers from the unfavorable wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we consider the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to mitigate this problem and improve FL performance with AirComp. Specifically, a novel performance-oriented long-term design scheme that integrated design multiple communication rounds to minimize the optimality gap of the loss function is proposed. We first analyze the convergence behavior of the FL procedure with the absence of channel fading and noise. Based on the obtained optimality gap which characterizes the impact of channel fading and noise in different communication rounds on the ultimate performance of FL, we propose both online and offline schemes to tackle the resulting design problem. Simulation results demonstrate that such a long-term design strategy can achieve higher test accuracy than the conventional isolated design approach in FL. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical results exhibit a “later-is-better” principle, which demonstrates the later rounds in the FL procedure are more sensitive to aggregation error, and hence more resources are required over time.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as image recognition and natural language processing. Moreover, some delay-sensitive applications of AI like autonomous driving, require timely processing of real-time data. Conventional approaches require a data center to collect all the raw data for centralized model training. However, collecting massive amounts of data from distributed devices incurs high latency and very high energy and bandwidth cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the computation resources of edge devices are wasted in such a centralized model, and potential privacy violations exist since local data is collected and processed at the central server. This has thus motivated the migration of AI applications from the center of networks to the network edge, where implicit knowledge can be locally distilled to provide timely and economical intelligence as well as improved privacy. Chief among techniques for edge AI is federated learning (FL), in which local model parameters or gradients are exchanged instead of raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the training procedure in a state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) may involve millions of parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, uplink communication overhead incurred during the iterative model update process becomes a critical bottleneck for FL given the limited communication bandwidth in practice. To address this issue, there has been considerable interest in communication-efficient uploading strategies for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Conventionally, edge devices are orthogonally scheduled to upload their local model parameters/gradients, and the edge server sequentially decodes the received signals. However, the radio resources required in such orthogonal multiple access (OMA) protocols scale significantly with the number of participating devices and the model dimension.
Therefore, different strategies have been proposed to alleviate this communication overhead, e.g., device sampling based on the network topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, model sparsification through the time correlations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and gradient quantization via lossy compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, all of these schemes sacrifice performance in order to deal with the limited communication resources.
As an alternative, the recently aroused over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique has shown its efficiency in the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one-shot</span> aggregation of simultaneously transmitted local model parameters/gradients as compared to OMA protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. AirComp essentially turns the air into a computer by leveraging the inherent waveform superposition property of wireless channels. Particularly, it allows all the participating devices in FL to access all the radio resources simultaneously instead of only a fraction of them as in conventional OMA schemes.
Moreover, its capability for <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one-shot</span> function computation has been validated in a series of works, such as the foundational study from an information theoretic perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, performance analysis for various systems from the signal processing perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and prototype validation in practical implementation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">AirComp empowered FL systems have been comprehensively investigated recently, including how to accelerate the convergence of FL under tight resources constraints (e.g., communication and computation resources) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> or reduce resources consumption while maintaining satisfactory learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Specifically, there have been two main lines of research in existing works: one is system optimization from the communication perspective including device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, transceiver design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and parameter/gradient compressing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the other is the inherent design of hyperparameters in the learning procedure, such as the learning rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and batch size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a two-step framework for joint device scheduling and receive beamformer design to improve the test accuracy. The local learning rate at edge devices was optimized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to combat the distortion induced by fading channels. Although AirComp has been envisioned and further validated to be a promising scalable model aggregation solution in FL, a crucial defect obstructs its implementation in practice. Specifically, the devices whose channels are deeply faded dominate the aggregation error in AirComp-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. This is because the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one-shot</span> aggregation demands that the signals transmitted by different devices be equally superimposed at the receiver, and thus the remaining devices with better channel conditions have to reduce their transmit power in order to perform signal alignment at the receiver. To this end, the strength of the obtained signal is diminished, and the aggregation accuracy is more sensitive to the inherent noise.
Therefore, the unfavorable propagation environment inevitably limits the performance of AirComp-based FL. Fortunately, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), a promising technology for the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and the future sixth-generation (6G) network, has shown its potential to overcome this detrimental effect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. By intelligently tuning signal reflections via a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements, IRSs are capable of dynamically altering wireless channels to enable precise model aggregation, thus enhancing the FL performance.
Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of IRSs in improving the performance of AirComp-based FL, e.g., weak channels were enhanced by IRSs to involve more devices in collaborative model training while sustaining precise aggregation thus accelerating the model convergence in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Besides, IRS was utilized to flexibly adjust the decoding order of heterogeneous data to serve both the FL and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) users on the same time-frequency resource in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and minimize the energy consumption of engaged devices in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the communication system design in the existing literature has not been tailored to the inherent characteristics of FL. The existing system design schemes in AirComp-based FL mainly focused on the isolated system design in each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In fact, FL is a long-term process consisting of many progressive learning rounds that collaboratively determine the ultimate learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Different learning rounds may have varying significance toward the convergence rate and the final model accuracy due to this intrinsic nature. Hence, resources need to be balanced among different iterations in FL by analyzing the collective impact of successive communication rounds on the ultimate performance.
The isolated resource allocation strategy in the existing works equally treats each learning round, which inevitably results in performance loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider an AirComp-based FL system, in which an IRS is employed to configure a favorable wireless channel to provide precise model aggregation in each iteration.
For the first time, we propose a performance-oriented long-term design approach to fully unleash the available communication resources, thus obtaining higher test accuracy.
The first step toward resource allocation across different learning rounds is to evaluate the impact of resources on the overall learning accuracy and convergence. To this end, we characterize the optimality gap of the loss function in arbitrary communication rounds, which unveils the relationship between communication accuracy in each communication round and ultimate learning performance.
Accordingly, a long-term system design scheme is proposed to minimize the optimality gap via integrated design over multiple communication rounds. Different from existing works that focused on the isolated design in each communication round, it is interesting to find that such an integrated approach exhibits a <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">later-is-better</span> principle, which confirms that the later rounds in the FL procedure are more sensitive to the aggregation error, and hence more resources are required over time.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We derive the general optimality gap of the loss function, which characterizes the impact of gradient aggregation errors in different communication rounds on the convergence performance of AirComp-based FL. From the obtained optimality gap, it is observed that within a finite number of communication rounds, the aggregation errors in later rounds have a greater impact on the optimality gap than those in earlier rounds. Hence, the later rounds are more essential to the learning performance of FL, and more resources need to be allocated to them. This observation provides important guidance for practical system design. However, the conventional isolated system design approach neglects the significant property and treats all the communication rounds equally.</p>

The transceiver design and the IRS phase shift tuning are decoupled through the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Furthermore, we propose an element-wise successive refinement algorithm with low complexity to guide the practical implementation of an IRS with discrete phase shift constraint.</p>

Instead of uploading all the raw data to the server, each device processes its local data in parallel and uploads the correspondingly generated local parameters or gradients to the server. We adopt the gradient sharing strategy in the FL procedure, i.e., the edge devices compute their local gradients and upload them to the edge server, and then the edge server broadcasts the global gradient which is computed based on the aggregated gradients to the edge devices for synchronizing local models’ update.</p>

Then, the generalized optimality gap, which is suitable for generic wireless networks, is derived to characterize the learning efficiency between two arbitrary communication rounds. The obtained optimality gap sheds light on how the imperfect gradient updates affect the convergence of FL. Next, we focus on the IRS-assisted AirComp to provide precise gradients aggregation for FL, and formulate the corresponding performance-oriented design problems.</p>

Solving a series of high-dimensional SDP problems drastically increases the computational burden. Besides, the additional steps to extract a suboptimal solution are often with intolerable computation consumption, especially when facing an IRS with large-scale elements that are common in practice. Furthermore, the obtained continuous phase shifts are practically difficult to implement due to hardware limitations. Generally, the discrete phase shifts optimization problem is shown as an integer linear program problem that can be optimally solved via the branch-and-bound with the worst-case exponential complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. To reduce the computational complexity and provide the near-optimal solution for the IRS with discrete phase shifts constraint, we successively refine the phase shift of each element until converges. It is noted that the phase shifts of all elements are fully separable in the constraint, and only coupled in the objective function. Hence, we can successively optimize the phase shift of each element until converges.

This is due to that the performance of AirComp is determined by the devices with poor channels. Fortunately, the FL system can still maintain satisfactory performance with the help of IRSs which can configure the deep faded channel to a favorable one.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a performance-oriented long-term design framework based on the optimality gap for IRS-assisted FL systems. By analyzing the convergence behavior of FL, both offline and online design schemes were established. We adopted the BCD method to tackle the highly-intractable problems. Simulation results have demonstrated that such a long-term design scheme can precisely allocate the resources to different communication rounds, hence achieving a higher test accuracy and faster convergence behavior in FL than the conventional isolated design approach. Besides, we have confirmed that the online design approach based on the Lyapunov framework can achieve satisfactory performance without foreseeing the future which can be regarded as a practical and promising approach for FL system. Further, it has been seen that the employed IRS can assist AirComp in providing precise model aggregation in FL, especially when the lookahead information is limited or devices are widely distributed. The relationship between communication accuracy and learning performance presented in the paper has been rigorously determined via mathematical proof and simulation verification, which have revealed a <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">later-is-better</span> principle that can provide significant guidance for the FL system design.</p>
