<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We show that aggregated model updates in federated learning may be insecure. An untrusted central server may disaggregate user updates from sums of updates across participants given repeated observations, enabling the server to recover privileged information about individual users’ private training data via traditional gradient inference attacks. Our method revolves around reconstructing participant information (e.g: which rounds of training users participated in) from aggregated model updates by leveraging summary information from device analytics commonly used to monitor, debug, and manage federated learning systems. Our attack is parallelizable and we successfully disaggregate user updates on settings with up to thousands of participants. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate significant improvements in the capability of various inference attacks on the disaggregated updates. Our attack enables the attribution of learned properties to individual users, violating anonymity, and shows that a determined central server may undermine the secure aggregation protocol to break individual users’ data privacy in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a method for collaboratively learning a shared model across multiple participants and enhances privacy by limiting data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan &amp; Ramage, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Hard et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Konečný et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Participants’ data privacy is preserved by sending model updates rather than raw data, which limits the amount of information that is exposed to the central server. In the context of applications, federated learning participants are edge devices such as users’ smart phones or wearables, and maintaining the integrity of their data is a critical issue. Already, federated learning has been deployed by many major companies in various privacy sensitive applications including sentiment learning, next word prediction, health monitoring, content suggestion, and item ranking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hard et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Guaranteeing data privacy in these scenarios is becoming increasingly important as the topic of privacy becomes more heavily scrutinized by the greater public and by government regulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan &amp; Ramage, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; McCabe, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; FTC, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research has shown that model updates may unintentionally leak information about their respective training examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geiping et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Melis et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. A central server that obtains participants’ model updates may perform inference attacks to learn significant information about participants’ training data, violating the core privacy principles of the federated learning paradigm. To address this critical privacy flaw, researchers have introduced methods leveraging secure multiparty computation to limit the central server’s visibility into individual participants’ model updates. Notably, secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Segal et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; So et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> has emerged as a standard security protocol which ensures that the central server may see only the final sum of model updates, rather than any individual update by itself. Thus, information learned from the aggregated model update may not be attributed to a specific user, which offers a layer of privacy against the central server. Additionally, by aggregating updates over tens to hundreds or thousands of users, updates are obfuscated to a point where most inference attacks are rendered ineffectual <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Melis et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Geiping et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The secure aggregation protocol is secure only to the degree that it hides individual participants’ model updates. A procedure that disaggregates individual participants’ updates or gradients from their sum would undermine the secure aggregation protocol and unveil the aforementioned privacy vulnerability. In this work, we develop a method for gradient disaggregation, showing that secure aggregation offers little privacy protection against an adversarial server seeking to undermine individual users’ data privacy. Our key insight is that participant information (e.g: which rounds of training users participated in) is derivable from aggregated model updates, when observing multiple rounds of training and leveraging summary analytics. We can reconstruct this information and use it to recover participants’ individual model updates (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Gradient Disaggregation: Breaking Privacy in Federated Learning by Reconstructing the User Participant Matrix" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure aggregation is a method based on secure multiparty computation and is a key privacy measure deployed in federated learning systems. Secure aggregation ensures that the central server sees only the final aggregate of model updates across users while guaranteeing that no participants’ updates are revealed in the clear <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Segal et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. The secure aggregation protocol enhances privacy by obfuscating a user’s model update with many other users’ updates, limiting inference attacks such as those in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Melis et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Geiping et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. This obfuscation also ensures that information learned from the aggregated model update may not be attributed to an individual user. Concretely, on the issue of attribution, the secure aggregation paper states: ”Using a Secure Aggregation protocol to compute these weighted averages would ensure that the server may learn only that one or more users in this randomly selected subset wrote a given word, but not which users” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Segal et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Infrastructure to support, debug, and manage federated learning systems is critical to their functioning. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> outlines the design of Google’s federated learning systems and describes its core components and protocols. A key aspect of their infrastructure is the collection of device analytics. Notably, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> collect several important device metrics such as how often devices performed training, how much memory devices used during training, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. These metrics ensure that users’ devices are not oversubscribed (draining battery) and may be used to debug device performance issues. Device analytics play a critical role in maintaining user experience quality: ”Device utility to the user is mission critical, and degradations are difficult to pinpoint and easy to wrongly diagnose. Using accurate analytics to prevent federated training from negatively impacting the device’s utility to the user accounts for a substantial part of our engineering and risk mitigation costs.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite></p>

Under certain conditions (e.g: assuming that in the transaction history each item was purchased by itself at least once) their approach recovers these item prices with high precision and allows them to reveal customers’ spending habits. Specifically, given a corpus of sums of item prices from customers’ transaction histories, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fleder &amp; Shah, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> utilizes a subset sum algorithm to uncover the individual prices of the transaction and to identify the products themselves.</p>

However, even if devices log only the total number of times they performed training (with no timestamped data) and send these analytics back to the server once every few rounds of participation, the central server may piece together these constraints and incorporate them into the formulation above. In other words, just knowing the number of times particular users performed training and collecting this information periodically (both of which are reasonable based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>), the central server may obtain enough information to carry out the gradient disaggregation attack. Incorporating summary analytics into the gradient disaggregation attack is significant as it greatly reduces the problem space, allowing a solution to a previously intractable problem.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We experimentally validate the capabilities and limitations of our gradient disaggregation procedure across various parameter settings. Note that unlike prior works performing server side attacks on privacy in federated learning, our method leverages participant information and rounds of aggregated gradients. Hence in our experiments we generate this information (across various settings) to understand how our attack behaves under different conditions. We evaluate the following parameters:</p>

AUC score quickly degrades with more users; however, with gradient disaggregation high AUC score is maintained across increased numbers of participants as each user’s model update is disaggregated exactly, allowing the property inference attack to be performed on each user separately. We note that the requirement in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Melis et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> that only the target has the particular data distribution is a limiting assumption, as many participants’ data may exhibit the property of interest.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce gradient disaggregation, a method to disaggregate model updates from sums of model updates given repeated observations and access to summary information from device analytics. Our attack is capable of disaggregating model updates over thousands of users and we apply it to augment existing attacks such as gradient inversion and property inference. Our attack undermines the secure aggregation protocol.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our findings show that summary metrics such as participation frequency may, when combined with gradient information, be used as an attack vector to undermine individual users’ data privacy in federated learning systems. Ways to mitigate this attack include: injecting noise into model updates to reduce efficacy of disaggregation, using differential privacy on the collected device metrics to make reconstruction more difficult, and reducing or eliminating the collection of device analytics. These mitigation strategies may hinder the management of federated learning systems, and employing these techniques to increase privacy must be balanced with the costs to utility. We hope that bringing awareness to the privacy risks of side channel information in federated learning infrastructure will assist in designing secure federated learning systems.</p>

<div id="S1a.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1a.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Prior experiments assumed that the central server fixed the neural network model. In the following experiments, we eliminate this assumption and update the neural network model with model updates computed from participants (via FedAvg). In this scenario, the attack becomes honest but curious as the attacker no longer has to modify the learning protocol (specifically, via fixing the model), but instead only needs to observe the gradient information and summary analytics collected by the server.</p>

<p id="S2a.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We perform experiments showing our gradient disaggregation attack with partial sets of constraints. Specifically, constraint granularity determines the rounds across which number of participations is known (e.g: if granularity is 10, we know how many times each user participated between rounds 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc) and we drop a specific fraction of these constraints (e.g: in prior setting, only knowing participation counts between rounds 0-9, 40-49, etc). Testing this scenario shows the degree to which our method works when only partial summary analytics is given. We enforced a time limit of 10 minutes for solving each column</p>
