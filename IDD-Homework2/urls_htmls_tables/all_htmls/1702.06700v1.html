<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) has witnessed great progress since May, 2015
as a classic problem unifying visual and textual data into a system.
Many enlightening VQA works explore deep into the image and question encodings and fusing methods,
of which attention is the most effective and infusive mechanism.
Current attention based methods focus on adequate fusion of visual and textual features,
but lack the attention to where people focus to ask questions about the image.
Traditional attention based methods attach a single value to the feature at each spatial location,
which losses many useful information.
To remedy these problems, we propose a general method to perform saliency-like pre-selection on overlapped region features by the interrelation of bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM),
and use a novel element-wise multiplication based attention method to capture more competent correlation information between visual and textual features.
We conduct experiments on the large-scale COCO-VQA dataset and analyze the effectiveness of our model demonstrated by strong empirical results.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) comes as a classic task which combines visual and textual modal data into a unified system.
Taking an image and a natural language question about it as input,
a VQA system is supposed to output the corresponding natural language answer.
VQA problem requires image and text understanding, common sense and knowledge inference.
The solution of VQA problem will be a great progress in approaching the goal of Visual Turing Test,
and is also conducive to tasks such as multi-modal retrieval, image captioning and accessibility facilities.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">After the first attempt and introduction of VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>,
more than thirty works on VQA have sprung up over the past one year from May, 2015.
Over ten VQA datasets and a big VQA challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have been proposed so far.
Four commonly used datasets
(<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e. </em>DAQUAR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, COCO-QA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, COCO-VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Visual7W <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) feature different aspects.
The common practice to tackle VQA problem is to translate the words as word embeddings and encode the questions using bag-of-word (BoW)
or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network,
and encode the images using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).
The following important step is to combine the image and question representations through some kind of fusing methods for answer generation,
such as concatenation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,
element-wise multiplication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, parameter prediction layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>,
episode memory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, etc.
Current VQA works focus on the fusion of these two features,
yet no one cares about “where we focus” to ask questions on the image.
It is a common practice to treat the VQA problem as either a generation, classification or a scoring task,
and classification gains more popularity due to its simplicity and easiness for comparison.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These works treat VQA as a discriminative model,
learning the conditional probability of answer given the image and question.
From the generative view,
we emulate the behavior that before people ask questions about the given image they first glance at it and find some interesting regions.
In terms of a single person, he has unique taste for choosing image regions that interest him.
For a large amount of people, there are statistical region-of-interest (RoI) distributions.
These region patterns are task-driven,
<em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g. </em>the picture in Figure. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Task-driven Visual Saliency and Attention-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
for VQA task people may focus mostly on the beds, the chairs, the laptop and the notebook regions (namely the RoI patterns) as captured in the weighted image,
but for image captioning task they pay attention to more areas including the striped floor.
It is very valuable to intensify the interesting region features and suppress others,
and this image preprocessing step provides more accurate visual features to the follow-up steps and is missing in current VQA works.
By analogy with visual saliency which captures the standing out regions or objects of an image,
we propose a region pre-selection mechanism named task-driven visual saliency which attaches interesting regions (more possibly questioned on) with higher weights.
Taking advantage of the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>
that the output at an arbitrary time step has complete and sequential information about all time steps before and after it,
we compute the weight of interest for each region feature which is relative to all of them.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs and analyzes BiLSTM in VQA models for task-driven saliency detection,
and this is the first contribution of our work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As a simple and effective VQA baseline method,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> shows that question feature always contributes more to predict the answer than image feature.
But image is as equally important as question for answer generation.
It is necessary to further explore finer-grained image features to achieve better VQA performance,
<em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g. </em>attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Current attention based models generally use the correlation scores between question and image representations as weights to perform weighted sum of region features,
the resulting visual vector is concatenated to the question vector for final answer generation.
The recent “multi-step” attention models (<em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e. </em>containing multiple attention layers) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
dig deeper into the image understanding and
help achieve better VQA performance than the “regular” attention models.
However, the correlation score obtained by inner product between visual and textual features is essentially the sum of the correlation vector obtained by element-wise multiplication of the two features.
Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> shows that element-wise multiplication of these features achieves more accurate results than concatenation of them in the baseline model.
Hence we propose to employ element-wise multiplication way in the attention mechanism,
the fused features are directly feed forward to a max pooling layer to get the final fused feature.
Together with the saliency-like region pre-selection operation,
this novel attention method effectively improves VQA performance and is the second contribution of this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
We first briefly review saliency and the attention mechanism.
Then, we elaborate our proposed method.
We present experiments of some baseline models and compare with state-of-the-art models and visualize the pre-selection saliency and attention maps.
Finally we summarize our work.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Saliency generally comes from contrasts between a pixel or an object and its surroundings,
describing how outstanding it is.
It could facilitate learning by focusing the most pertinent regions.
Saliency detection methods mimic the human attention in psychology,
including both bottom-up and top-down manners <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Typical saliency methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> are pixel- or object-oriented,
which are not appropriate for VQA due to center bias and are difficulty in collecting large scale eye tracking data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We think task-driven saliency on image features could be conductive to solving VQA problem.
What inspires us is that BiLSTM used in saliency detection has achieved good results on text and video tasks.
In sentiment classification tasks,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> assigns saliency scores to words related to sentiment for visualizing and understanding the effects of BiLSTM in textual sentence.
While in video highlight detection,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> uses a recurrent auto-encoder configured with BiLSTM cells and extracts video highlight segments effectively.
BiLSTM has demonstrated its effectiveness in saliency detection,
but to the best of our knowledge it has not been used in visual saliency for VQA task.</p>

and gained performance improvement from traditional methods using holistic image features.
Attention mechanism is typically the weighted sum of the image region features at each spatial location,
where the weights describe the correlation and are implemented as the inner products of the question and image features.
It explores finer-grained visual features and mimics the behavior that people attend to different areas according to the questions.
Focusing on “knowing where to look” for multiple-choice VQA tasks,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> uses 99 detected object regions plus a holistic image feature to make correlation with the question encoding,

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with image captioning which generates general descriptions about an image,
VQA focuses on specific image regions depending on the question.
On the one hand, these regions include non-object and background contents which are hard for object detection based VQA methods.
On the other hand, although people may ask questions at any areas of a given image,
there are always some region patterns that attract more questions.
On the whole, there are statistical region-of-interest (RoI) patterns which represent human-interested areas that are important for later VQA task.
We propose a saliency-like region pre-selection and attention-based VQA framework illustrated in Figure. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Attention in VQA Models ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Task-driven Visual Saliency and Attention-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

Hence, the output at each location is influenced by the region features before and after it,
which embodies the correlation among these regions.
Note that, although the DMN+ work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> uses similar bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) in the visual input module,
their purpose is to produce input facts which contain global information.
Besides, their BiGRU takes the features embedded to the textual space as inputs.
In contrast, the BiLSTM used in our model takes directly visual CNN features as input,
and the main purpose is to output weights for region feature selection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The output values of the BiLSTM are normalized through a softmax layer,
and the resulting weights are multiplied by the region features.
We treat the weights as degree of interest which are trained by error back-propagation of the final class cross entropy losses,

in other words, these region patterns may get higher attention values in the latter interaction with question embeddings in a statistical way.</p>

We follow the common practice to evaluate models on two tasks on the real image dataset,
which includes 248,349 training questions, 121,512 validation questions and 244,302 testing questions.
There are many types of questions which require image and question understanding, commonsense knowledge, knowledge inference and even external knowledge.
The answers are roughly divided into 3 types, <em id="S4.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e. </em>“yes/no”, “number” and “other”.</p>

The COCO-VQA dataset provide human-labeled answers for the training and validation sets,
and the results of testing set can only be tested on the evaluation server.
The whole testing set is named test-standard and can be evaluated once per day and 5 times in total,
and a smaller development set named test-dev can be tested 10 times per day and 9999 times in total.
In short, the COCO-VQA dataset is large and hard enough for evaluating models and hence we choose to evaluate our model on it.</p>

From the columns, we can see that:
(1) holistic is better than TraAtt, proving the effectiveness of element-wise multiplication feature fusion compared with concatenation of features.
(2) RegAtt is better than holistic, indicating our novel attention method indeed enriches the visual features and improves the performance.
(3) SalAtt is better than RegAtt, demonstrating the strength of our region pre-selection mechanism.
(4) ConAtt is worse than SalAtt, showing that BiLSTM is important for the region pre-selection part.
From each row, we find the consistent improvement by the ResNet features,
showing the importance of good CNN features to VQA.</p>

For the question “Is the boy dressed for the weather?”,
the attention map focuses on the boy, his clothes and the surrounding regions to get a positive answer.
While for question “What is the boy doing?”, it attends the boy and the snowboard, thus giving answer “snowboarding”.
The third sample gives inaccurate but explainable answers,

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a general VQA solution which integrates region pre-selection and a novel attention method to capture generic class region and richer fused feature representation.
These two procedures are independent, meanwhile they both contribute to better VQA performance.
Although the model is simple, it achieves comparative or higher empirical results than state-of-the-art models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Possible future works include adopting finer-grained grids which capture more precise regions,
employing stacked attention layers for multi-step reasoning and more accurate answer location,
and applying the general pre-selection method to other attention-based VQA models.
The pre-selection mechanism is valuable and applicable to similar task, such as image captioning.</p>
