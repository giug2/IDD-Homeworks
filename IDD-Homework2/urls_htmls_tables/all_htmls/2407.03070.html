<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">Deploying Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on top of 5G and Beyond networks (5GB) makes them vulnerable to increasing vectors of security and privacy attacks. In this context, a wide range of advanced machine/deep learning-based solutions have been designed to accurately detect security attacks. Specifically, supervised learning techniques have been widely applied to train attack detection models. However, the main limitation of such solutions is their inability to detect attacks different from those seen during the training phase, or new attacks, also called zero-day attacks. Moreover, training the detection model requires significant data collection and labeling, which increases the communication overhead, and raises privacy concerns.
To address the aforementioned limits, we propose in this paper a novel detection mechanism that leverages the ability of the deep auto-encoder method to detect attacks relying only on the benign network traffic pattern. Using federated learning, the proposed intrusion detection system can be trained with large and diverse benign network traffic, while preserving the CAVs’ privacy, and minimizing the communication overhead. The in-depth experiment on a recent network traffic dataset shows that the proposed system achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate, and the detection delay.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fifth generation (5G) and beyond (5GB) networks promise to revolutionize the transportation industry by enabling ultra-reliability with ultra-low latency and high bandwidth communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These advances will significantly empower many verticals, such as smart agriculture, health, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). As part of ITS, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have been taken significant and careful considerations in 3GPP 5G standards  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Specifically, integrating V2X communications into the 5G ecosystem has enabled innovative use cases and applications, such as advanced driving, vulnerable road user protection, and vehicle platooning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Yet this progress is expected to be extended with 5GB, contributing thus to reducing traffic accidents and dramatically saving road users’ lives. However, CAVs at all automation levels will face a massive vector of cyberattacks coming from 5GB technologies and leading to hazardous situations for road users. For example, Distributed and Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have already been demonstrated to break 5G services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. But the impact of these attacks are likely to be more expansive with the integration of CAVs. More than this, cyberattacks are working continuously to develop novel tactics for breaching and breaking such systems. Facing all these challenges, Machine Learning (ML) appears as a key cybersecurity enabler to protect 5GB-enabled CAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Various Machine Learning (ML)/ Deep Learning (DL) based Intrusion Detection Systems (ML/DL-based IDSs) have been proposed to protect vehicular networks against attacks. Most of them rely on supervised and centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Centrally training the detection model requires significant data collection and labeling, which increases the communication overhead, and may raise privacy concerns. To mitigate centralized learning limitations, collaborative ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has been used, enabling thus continuous accuracy evolution and flexibility. Nevertheless, several limitations exist in early collaborative ML-based IDSs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Specifically, they generate a significant communication overhead during ML model updates and may violate data privacy, since learning nodes might share private information. To cope with the aforementioned issues, recent research  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> leveraged the potential of federated leaning (FL) paradigm, which has shown promising results in many applications. FL is a distributed ML paradigm allowing several nodes to train a global model cooperatively without sharing their datasets, avoiding thus overhead and mitigating privacy risks  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Interestingly, all existing FL-based IDSs for 5GB-enabled CAVs rely on supervised learning techniques. One important limitation of using such techniques is their inability to detect attacks different from those seen during the training phase (unseen attacks), and zero-day attacks. Another challenging issue is data imbalance, i.e., the numbers of benign and malicious traffic samples are not in the same range. Benign network traffic samples are easily available. On the other hand, malicious samples are scarce or unavailable. The lack of a thorough dataset of attack samples limits the usage of supervised techniques. Finally, most existing detection approaches assume that FL clients maintain labeled datasets that may use at each round. This assumption may not be realistic, as CAVs cannot label the network flow on every turn.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a CAV runs a set of well-known applications (safety, convenience, commercial, etc), their communication pattern should present a high degree of regularity so long as they are not under attack or faulty. Similarly, an attack must alter its communication pattern. Therefore, we believe it is possible to use anomaly detection techniques to model the CAV’s benign (or expected) communication pattern and detect attacks as anomalous occurrences. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of the existing IDSs, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised federated learning based IDS that leverages a deep auto-encoder model to train the detection model, relying only on benign network traffic. Thanks to federated learning, the proposed IDS can be trained with large and diverse benign network traffic, while preserving the CAVs’ privacy. The proposed IDS aggregates the detection model updates within the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) server to enhance the learning efficiency and minimize latency. The in-depth experiment on a recent network traffic dataset shows that the proposed system achieves a high detection rate while
minimizing the false positive rate, and the detection delay.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several distributed ML-based IDSs have been proposed for detecting attacks in 5GB-enabled CAVs. Negi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> presented a DL-based IDS to detect anomalies in ITS based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In this work, time series data are collected by CAVs and sent to the cloud to enable the training and retraining of a global model using a cluster of servers instead of one server. Shu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a collaborative IDS based on supervised DL, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Software Defined Networking (SDN). The proposed system enables distributed SDN controllers managing sub-networks of CAVs to train a global model for the whole network without directly exchanging their sub-network flows. However, both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> raise privacy issues since datasets are shared between learning nodes. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a distributed ML-based IDS that enables CAVs to directly communicate to train a global model based on supervised learning without sharing their datasets. However, peer-to-peer distributed learning generates a large overhead, degrading communication performance. Uprety et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a FL-based privacy-preserving collaborative IDS for CAVs. This work enables CAVs (FL clients) to train DL models on a locally labeled dataset and share their parameters with the central FL server to build a global model. Boualouache et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a FL-based privacy-preserving collaborative IDS based on supervised learning that leverages a set of FL servers to train the global model. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed FL for collaborative IDS. This work suggests offloading the training to distributed vehicular edge nodes. Specifically, CAVs act as FL clients for building models based on their locally labeled datasets and Roadside Units (RSUs) for aggregating global models. Hbaieb et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed SDN-FL-based IDS for CAVs. In this work, SDN controllers train local models based on labeled datasets built using data collected from CAVs, while the aggregation of global models is performed on the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, existing FL-based IDSs for 5GB-enabled CAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have specifically two main limitations: (i) they are based on supervised learning which limits their effectiveness against unseen and zero-day attacks, and (ii) they assume that FL clients have labeled datasets, which in practice might be unrealistic. Considering these gaps, we propose a novel network-based IDS trained using a deep auto-encoder model. Relying only on benign network traffic, our system can detect unseen or zero-day attacks so long as they alter the benign communication pattern of the CAV. Additionally, our solution does not compromise the CAV’s privacy since it is built through federated learning.</p>

Each CAV computes local updates on top of both the AE model and its local data. Once done, each CAV sends its local model’s parameters (weights) to the MEC server.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, VDoS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is the only publicly available dataset that includes benign and malicious traffic generated based on a realistic testbed. The network traffic was gathered in three different settings: urban, rural, and highway. The experimental environment included two vehicles, 3 physical machines, 4 virtual machines, 2 access points, a 4G modem, and two Cisco antennas. Common user applications such as Google Maps, YouTube, social networks, and other real-time applications (video/audio calls) have been run to generate benign network traffic. To generate malicious traffic, three Kali-Linux machines run three scenarios of DoS attack: UDP Flood, SYN Flood, and Slowloris packets alternately. In this research, we do not consider the third scenario, because we believe it is quite unusual that a CAV may hosts a web server. For further details about the testbed and the dataset generation please refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">New attack vectors have emerged from the integration of V2X communication in the 5G ecosystem, which may lead to hazardous situations for road users. Most of the existing IDSs in 5G-V2X are either unable to detect emerging zero-day attacks because they rely on supervised learning, or do not meet privacy requirements due to data collection required for centralized learning. To tackle these limits, we proposed in this paper a new IDS based on a deep auto-encoder model, which leverages the predictability of benign network traffic to detect attacks. Relying on federated training orchestrated by the MEC server, the proposed IDS did not require any data collection or labeling. Through in-depth experiments on a recent dataset, we have shown that the proposed IDS provides high performance even with few communication rounds and a short TW sampling, which allows fast training and low detection delay.
In future work, we plan to evaluate the proposed IDS on other non-Identical Independent Distribution (non-IID) datasets including more sophisticated and recent attacks.</p>
