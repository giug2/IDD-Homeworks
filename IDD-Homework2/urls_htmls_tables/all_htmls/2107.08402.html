<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a prominent framework that enables
clients (e.g., mobile devices or organizations) to train a collaboratively global model under a central server’s orchestration while keeping local training datasets’ privacy. However, the aggregation step in federated learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks as the central server cannot manage clients’ behavior. Therefore, the global model’s performance and convergence of the training process will be affected under such attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability issue, we propose a novel robust aggregation algorithm inspired by the truth inference methods in crowdsourcing via incorporating the worker’s reliability into aggregation. We evaluate our solution on three real-world datasets with a variety of machine learning models. Experimental results show that our solution ensures robust federated learning and is resilient to various types of attacks, including noisy data attacks, Byzantine attacks, and label flipping attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising new collaborative learning framework to build a shared model across multiple clients (e.g., devices or organizations) while keeping the clients’ data private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The latter is also known as cross-silo FL, which we focus on in this paper. Such a framework is practical and flexible and can be applied in various domains, such as conversational AI and healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Training a generalizable model for these domains requires a diverse dataset. Accessing and obtaining data from multiple organizations and centralizing them in a third-party service provider can be impractical considering data privacy concerns or regulations. Yet, we still wish to use data across various organizations because a model trained on data from one organization may be subject to bias and poor generalization performance. FL makes it possible to harness the data for joint model training with better generalization performance without the requirement to share raw private local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a cross-silo FL framework (as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ RobustFed: A Truth Inference Approach for Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), there is a semi-honest global coordinating server and several participating clients. The global server controls the learning process and aggregates the model parameters submitted by clients during multiple communication rounds. The clients train the same model locally using their local datasets. Then, they share their updated local model parameters, not their raw data, with the server, which aggregates all their contributions and broadcasts back the updated global model parameters.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The most commonly used aggregation algorithm is called Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that takes a weighted average of the local model parameters. This aggregation method is vulnerable to adversarial attacks or unintentional errors in a system. Due to strategic adversarial behavior (e.g., label-flipping and Gaussian noise attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>) or infrastructure failures (e.g., Byzantine faults <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> where client nodes act arbitrarily), the clients can send malicious (manipulated) or arbitrary values to the server. Thus, the global model can be affected severely. Therefore, robust FL against such potential behaviors or failures is essential.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several methods have been proposed to mitigate attacks in FL or distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The statistical methods such as median or trimmed mean based aggregation (instead of weighted averaging)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> perform well under Byzantine attack. However, they fail under other types of attacks such as label-flipping and Gaussian noise attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes using a truth inference approach for robust aggregation against such attacks in FL. Truth inference is a key component of crowdsourcing that aggregates the answers of the crowd (i.e., workers) to infer the true label of tasks (e.g., traffic incidents, image annotation) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. We make this connection for the first time that the model parameter aggregation can be formulated as a truth inference problem, i.e., each client is a worker, the local parameters (answers) by the workers need to be aggregated to estimate the global parameter (label). The key idea is to explicitly model the reliability of clients and take them into consideration during aggregation. Such an approach has shown promising results in crowdsourcing compared to simple aggregation approaches such as majority voting (or averaging). However, there are several challenges and opportunities in applying the truth inference approach for robust FL (compared to crowdsourcing). First, an attacker can manipulate the local training data (e.g., adding noise or flipping the labels) to affect the model parameters (versus directly changing the model parameters). The server only observes the model parameters without access to the data. Hence, a direct application of the truth inference approach on the model parameters cannot detect the malicious clients reliably. Second, FL requires multi-round communication of the local model parameters to the server. This dynamic information creates both challenges and opportunities in detecting unreliable clients. Finally, as in many practical settings, the server does not have access to any golden validation set for validating the local parameter models in order to detect unreliable clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we derive the clients’ reliability score by solving an optimization problem over multiple iterations of FL. We then incorporate the reliability of each client in the aggregation. Our approach is based on two main insights. First, the existing truth inference approaches rely entirely on the derived reliability of the workers for aggregation. In our case, since the model parameters may not accurately reflect the reliability of the workers due to the different kinds of attacks (e.g., label-flipping), we use a pruning algorithm that removes clients with outlier reliability, which mitigates the impact of the malicious clients during aggregation.
Second, we exploit the multi-round model parameters submitted by the clients for evaluating the client’s reliability in a more robust way. We briefly summarize our contributions as follows.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL), all the participants agree on a common learning objective and model structure. The attacker aims to compromise the global model by uploading the malicious data to the global server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The adversary can control the whole local training dataset, local hyper-parameter of a model, and local model parameters in this system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper mainly considers the data poisoning attack scenario, in which malicious clients create poisoned training samples and inject them into their local training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Then, the local model is trained on the dataset contaminated with such poisoned samples. The purpose of this attack is to manipulate the global model to misclassify on test datasets. These attacks can be further divided into two categories: 1) label-flipping attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and 2) noisy features attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The label-flipping attack occurs where the labels of training examples of one class are flipped to another class while the data features remain unchanged. For example, an attacker can train a local model with cat images misclassified as a dog and then share the poisoned local model for aggregation. A successful attack forces a model to incorrectly predicts cats to be dogs. In the noisy features attacks, the adversary adds noise to the features while keeping the class label of each data point intact <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Noisy data and the backdoor attacks fall in this type of attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> show that just one or two adversarial clients are enough to compromise the performance of the global model. Thus, developing a robust method against these attacks is essential. Fung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a defense method, called FoolsGold, against data poisoning attack in FL in a non-IID setting. Their solution differentiates the benign clients from the adversary ones by calculating the similarity of their submitted gradients. Other techniques use the recursive Bayes filtering method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to mitigate the data poisoning attack.
In some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, researchers assume that the global server has access to a golden validation dataset that represents data distribution from clients. The server can detect adversaries by assessing the effectiveness of provided updates on the global model’s performance. If the updates do not improve the global model’s performance, the client is flagged as a potential adversary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, this method requires the validation dataset which is difficult to achieve in practice.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Byzantine clients aim to prevent the global model’s convergence or lead the global model to converge to a poor solution. In some scenarios, the Byzantine clients choose to add Gaussian noise to the gradient estimators, then send these perturbed values to the server. The Byzantine gradients can be hard to distinguish from the benign clients since their variance and magnitude are similar to the benign gradient submissions. Byzantine-Robust methods have been studied in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A common aggregation method against the Byzantine attack is based on the median of the updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This method aggregates each model parameter independently. It sorts the local models’ jth parameters and takes the median as the jth parameter for the global model. Trimmed mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is another method that sorts jth parameters of all local models, then removes the largest and smallest of them, and computes the mean of the remaining parameters as the jth parameter of the global model.
Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> selects one of the local models that are similar to other models as the global model. Krum first computes the nearest neighbors to each local model. Then, it calculates the sum of the distance between each client and their closest local models. Finally, select the local model with the smallest sum of distance as the global model. Aggregation methods such as Krum and trimmed mean need to know the upper bound of the number of compromised workers. Other methods extend Krum, such as Multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and Bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Multi-Krum combines Krum and averaging. Bulyan combines Krum and trimmed mean. It iteratively applies Krum to local models then applies trimmed mean to aggregate the local models.</p>

Effective truth inference, especially given sparse data, requires assessment of workers’ reliability. There exist various approaches to infer the truth of tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, including direct computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, probabilistic graphical model (PGM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and neural network based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. The simplest method is majority voting, which works well if all workers provide answers to all of the tasks. However, it fails when data is sparse and workers may be unreliable, as in many practical settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, two experimental studies compared state-of-the-art truth inference methods in a ”normal” setting and ”adversarial” setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The ”adversarial” environment is where workers intentionally or strategically manipulate the answers. In the ”normal” setting, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> concluded that truth inference methods that utilize a PGM have the best performances in most settings where the type of tasks are binary and single label. The study in the ”adversarial” settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> focusing on binary tasks showed that neural networks and PGM based methods are generally more robust than other methods for the binary type of tasks.
In our FL setting, since we are dealing with model parameters that are numeric and updates that are dense (i.e. a subset of participants submit their model parameters in each round), we use an optimization based truth inference method PM as a baseline method.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we mainly consider the data poisoning attack and Byzantine attack. The data poisoning attack is applied in the local training phase and divided into label-flipping and noisy data attacks. In each round, the attacker trains a new local model (based on the global model from the previous round) on the poisoned training data and uploads the new model parameters to the server. Byzantine attack directly changes the model parameters to be uploaded to the server. For the adversarial model, we follow two assumptions: (1) The number of adversaries is less than 50% of whole clients; (2) the data is distributed among the clients in an independent and identically (IID) fashion.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present our proposed robust aggregation method in this section. The key idea is to explicitly model the reliability of clients inspired by truth inference algorithms and take them into consideration during aggregation. We first introduce the truth inference framework and utilize it in FL to estimate the reliability of provided updates by clients in each round. We further improve it by removing the outlier clients before aggregation to address its limitations of correctly detecting malicious clients in data poisoning attacks. Finally, we incorporate the multi-round historical model parameters submitted by the clients for more robust aggregation.
The high-level system model is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4 Proposed Robust Model Aggregation ‣ RobustFed: A Truth Inference Approach for Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The server comprises two modules: (1) the reliability score calculator; and (2) the aggregator. The server calculates each client’s reliability based on three proposed methods that is improved upon each other.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.3" class="ltx_p">We can map the model aggregation at the server in FL into the truth inference problem by considering the model’s weight parameters as tasks.
In both crowdsourcing and FL, we deal with unlabeled data. In crowdsourcing, the true label of tasks are not available; in FL, the true parameters of the model are unknown (the server does not have access to any validation dataset). The parameter aggregation can be considered as a numeric task (as versus binary task).

The loss function measures the distance between the aggregated parameters (estimated truth) and the parameters provided by client (observation). When the observation deviates from the estimated truth, the loss function return a high value. To constrain the clients’ reliabilities into a certain range, the regularization function is defined and it reflects the distributions of clients’ reliabilities.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, a reliable client is penalized more if their observation is quite different from the estimated truth. In contrast, the observation made by an unreliable client with low reliability is allowed to be further from the truth. To minimize the objective function, the estimated truth relies more on the clients with high reliability. The estimated truth and clients’ reliabilities are learned together by optimizing the objective function through a joint procedure. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We note that a straightforward method is to remove the clients with lowest reliability scores. Intuitively, we expect the server to assign a higher reliability to honest clients and a lower score to the malicious ones. In our experimental studies, we indeed observe this when no attack happens or under specific types of attacks such as Byzantine or data noise attacks. However, under label-flipping attack, we observe that the RobustFed method assigns higher reliability to the malicious clients. This is because the gradients of the malicious clients can be outliers under such attacks and significantly dominates (biases) the aggregated model parameters, and hence has a high reliability because of its similarity to the aggregated values. Therefore, in our approach, we disregard the clients with reliability deviating significantly from the others.</p>

Ignoring this temporal relationship might miss important insights of the parameters shared by clients at each rounds. Intuitively, under data poisoning or label flipping attacks, considering the parameters over multiple rounds will more effectively reveal the malicious clients. To take advantage of temporal information, we propose RobustFed<sub id="S4.SS4.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">t</span></sub> to incorporate the statistical information of the previous rounds during the reliability estimation.

<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Static Setting:</span> The server selects the same set of clients at each round to participate in training global model. Therefore, we add the statistics of the model parameters from previous rounds as new tasks in addition to the vector of weights. These statistics are the number of large weights, number of small weights, median of weights and average of weights. The reliability is then evaluated based on all statistics and the parameters submitted in current rounds.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dynamic Setting</span>: The server dynamically selects a set of clients to join FL and participate in training global model.

We observe that RobustFed assigns higher reliability to benign workers and vice versa under Byzantine attack and noisy data attack as we expected. However, the opposite behavior is observed under flipping attack. As we discussed, this is likely because the gradients of the malicious clients are outliers under such attacks and significantly dominates (biases) the aggregated model parameters, and hence has high reliability due to the Euclidean distance based evaluation. Therefore, in our Robust<sub id="S5.SS2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_sub">+</sub> approach, we disregard the clients with both high or low reliabilities, which will help mitigate the impact of the malicious clients.</p>

It’s worth noting that it separates the two types of clients extremely well under Byzantine attack and successfully recognizes malicious clients in all attacks, i.e., assigning close to 0 reliability for them.</p>

We study the impact of the number of malicious clients on the proposed aggregation method.

By increasing the number of malicious clients, the performance of the global model slightly drops.

However, in the CIFAR_10 dataset that has a poor performance on clean data, RobustFed<sub id="S5.SS2.p3.3.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.3.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">t</span></sub> could not improve the performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the vulnerability of the conventional aggregation methods in FL. We proposed a truth inference approach to estimate and incorporate the reliability of each client in the aggregation, which provides a more robust estimate of the global model. In addition, the enhanced approach with historical statistics further improves the robustness. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that RobustFed<sub id="S6.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sub">+</sub> and RobustFed<sub id="S6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S6.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">t</span></sub> are robust to malicious clients with label flipping, noisy data, and Byzantine attacks compared to the conventional and state-of-the-art aggregation methods. This study focuses on data with IID distribution among clients; future research could consider non-IID distribution.</p>
