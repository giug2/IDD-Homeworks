<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication systems, can facilitate data transmission for users all over the world, especially in some remote areas where vast amounts of informative data are collected by Internet of remote things (IoRT) devices
to support various data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) services.
However, training AI models centrally with the assistance of SAGIN faces the challenges of highly constrained network topology, inefficient data transmission, and privacy issues.
To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel topology-aware federated learning framework for the SAGIN, namely Olive Branch Learning (OBL).
Specifically, the IoRT devices in the ground layer leverage their private data to perform model training locally, while the air nodes in the air layer and the ring-structured low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in the space layer are in charge of model aggregation (synchronization) at different scales.
To further enhance communication efficiency and inference performance of OBL, an efficient Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment (CNASA) algorithm is designed by taking the data class distribution of the air nodes as well as their geographic locations into account.
Furthermore, we extend our OBL framework and CNASA algorithm to adapt to more complex multi-orbit satellite networks.
We analyze the convergence of our OBL framework and conclude that the CNASA algorithm contributes to the fast convergence of the global model.
Extensive experiments based on realistic datasets corroborate the superior performance of our algorithm over the benchmark policies.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of aerospace, deep-sea exploration, and unmanned technologies, Internet of remote things (IoRT) devices have been widely adopted in remote areas (e.g., isolated islands, desert hinterlands, and the deep sea) for remote sensing and environmental monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These informative sensing data can be further utilized for artificial intelligence (AI) model training to support a large number of data-driven intelligent applications, like natural hazard analysis and vegetation extent monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, with the absence of terrestrial communication facilities such as fifth-generation (5G) base stations in remote areas, it is challenging for the dispersed IoRT devices to transmit the collected data to a centralized server for further processing and training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, serving as a complement and extension of terrestrial communication networks, offers seamless wireless access to wide geographical areas and provides a promising solution to facilitate IoRT data transmission. Specifically, SAGIN is based on a hierarchical network architecture that integrates satellite constellation in the space layer, air nodes (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, airships, balloons, etc.) in the air layer, and end devices (e.g., IoT devices) in the ground layer. The satellite constellation introduced in SAGIN is responsible for global coverage, while the air nodes flying at a low altitude can provide flexible ubiquitous accessibility with low propagation latency, thus supporting the data transmission of IoRT applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Taking advantage of the wide coverage and large communication capacity of SAGIN, many established satellite operators are deploying their SAGIN projects (e.g., Starlink, Telesat, OneWeb, etc.) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To reap the benefits of the massive data from the IoRT devices, a predominant approach is to collect the scattered IoRT data to a cloud server for centralized machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, this kind of approach
requires a central server to continuously collect the massive volume of sensing data scattered around the IoRT devices over expensive satellite networks in SAGIN scenarios, which will lead to heavy communication costs and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
To cope with these problems, a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method termed Federated Learning (FL) is proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. FL enables collaboratively training a shared global ML model under the coordination of a central server by aggregating locally-computed updates while keeping the sensitive data in local clients (e.g., IoRT devices). In addition, the communication cost depends on the customizable model size and does not scale up with the increase of local data size. Thus, FL model learning is able to guarantee a reduced communication cost considering the massive device data in SAGIN scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Leveraging the privacy-preserving collaborative learning power of FL, we advocate a novel topology-aware framework, namely Olive Branch Learning (OBL), tailored to the inherent characteristics of SAGIN such as system hierarchy and specific topologies of different layers.
Nevertheless, such SAGIN based federated learning framework still faces the following challenges. First, despite of the data heterogeneity (i.e., not independently and identically distributed data, or non-IID data) inherent in the dispersed IoRT devices, the hierarchical mechanism of OBL may introduce new dimensions of data heterogeneity (e.g., in the space layer), which may further lead to degraded model accuracy and slow convergence speed for OBL. Second, long model delivery time will occur if an air node communicates with its associated remote satellite by using several relay satellites as intermediates.
To deal with the above challenges, we devise a Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment (CNASA) algorithm to boost the training process of OBL by considering both geographical distance and data class distribution of the air nodes into account. Furthermore, we also extend the OBL framework to the multi-orbit SAGIN and devise an efficient enhanced version of CNASA algorithm for the air node-satellite assignment in the complicated multi-orbit SAGIN network.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the global-area coverage of the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), data scattered across ubiquitous end devices can be brought together to support data-driven artificial intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Nei et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose a deep learning-based method to improve the traffic control performance of SAGIN considering the satellite traffic balance.
Cheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> present a deep reinforcement learning-based computing offloading approach considering the network dynamics as well as the energy and computation constraints.
Tan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> propose a multi-modal emotion recognition model for autonomous vehicles based on a 5G-enabled SAGIN.
These works achieve great performance in terms of network throughput or model accuracy, but the data of devices are exposed to the server, which may violate the user’s privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an emerging distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) preserves privacy by leaving the training process to the users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
FL has achieved great success in many applications such as the next-word prediction on mobile phones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
As the number of devices increases, the server suffer from excessive communication overhead inevitably, thereby deteriorating the learning performance.
To address this issue, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> propose the client-edge-cloud hierarchical FL system where edge servers perform partial model aggregation to reduce the server’s communication overhead.
However, no matter in standard FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the model performance would degrade severely when the local datasets are highly imbalanced (widely known as not independently and identically distributed, non-IID).
To cope with this challenge, Mhaisen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> propose a heuristic-based approach to facilitate the convergence of the global model by greedily equalizing the class distribution among edge devices.
Nonetheless, the authors ignore the communication delay within the client-edge network, which in some cases can greatly increase the overall delay.
Other promising research directions for hierarchical FL include the resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the above FL approaches do not take into account the unique characteristics of SAGIN such as the network topology properties, and directly adopting such FL schemes would lead to poor performance.
Thus, how to efficiently deploy FL into SAGIN remains to be carefully considered.
Existing works on the deployment of FL focus on the air and ground segments of SAGIN.
For example, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> propose an FL-based air quality sensing framework in the aerial-ground integrated network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) collaboratively monitor the air quality index (AQI) without sharing the raw data.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> present a UAV-aided image classification approach for area exploration.
In their scheme, FL is considered for training collected images in each UAV locally, and a ground server is in charge of model aggregation.
Dong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> propose a novel architecture called UaaIS (UAVs as an intelligent service) for the air-ground integrated network and verify the efficiency of UaaIS in the scenario of UAV-enabled FL.
All of these works focus on the deployment of FL in the air-ground integrated network but pay no attention to the space layer, an essential component of SAGIN.
Instead, we attach importance to the space layer of SAGIN and leverage the Ring Allreduce algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> for fast model aggregation to make full use of the ring topology of the satellite orbit.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a collaborative model training scenario in the SAGIN, which naturally possesses a hierarchical architecture with three layers: space layer, air layer, and ground layer. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A Model Training Scenario in SAGIN ‣ III Olive Branch Learning Framework ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the IoRT devices in the ground layer conduct environmental monitoring and generate massive information-rich data for AI model training.
The air nodes in the air layer hover over the equator to provide flexible ubiquitous accessibility with the satellites in the space layer for the IoRT devices in their coverage areas, which can be classified into two different types, that is, high-altitude platforms (HAPs) (e.g., airships and balloons) that operate at the stratospheric altitudes in typically quasi-stationary locations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and low-altitude platforms (LAPs) (e.g., helicopter and multicopter) that can also stay stationary in the air <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. For the air node (e.g., UAV) which moves within the coverage area of its associated satellite (which is usually very large), the connectivity and link quality between the air node and its associated satellite or IoRT devices do not change with its mobility.
The satellites are evenly distributed in the equatorial low earth orbit to provide wide coverage.
To benefit from the massive data from the IoRT devices, the centralized model training requires IoRT devices to upload raw data to a cloud server via SAGIN, but this leads to data privacy leakage risks and significant communication costs. To address these issues, we propose to leverage the popular federated learning to train a global shared model for SAGIN without compromising data privacy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the inspirations above, we advocate a novel privacy-preserving learning framework named Olive Branch Learning (OBL), due to its similar structure with the olive branch, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-B Framework Overview of Olive Branch Learning ‣ III Olive Branch Learning Framework ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. OBL well captures the hierarchy and specific topologies of different layers in SAGIN. Specifically, IoRT devices in the ground layer are prone to send model updates to the satellites in the space layer with the air nodes in the air layer serving as intermediates. Hence, the ground-air-space communication naturally forms a star architecture with the satellite acting as the central node (aggregator). Accordingly, we can integrate the standard synchronous federated learning (e.g., the canonical FedAvg approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) for satellite model aggregation. For inter-satellite model synchronization in the same orbit, a common way is to reform these satellites into a star structure by assigning one satellite as the master to coordinate model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which leads to an increasing multi-hop communication cost within the space layer. Differently, the proposed OBL framework leverages the Ring Allreduce algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which fully unleashes the benefits of the ring topology formed by the satellites in the same orbit, for fast and efficient additive model aggregation among satellites.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We should emphasize that the movement of satellites does not impact the learning performance of OBL from the perspective of IoRT devices. Following the virtual node strategy in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we can assume that there are many fixed logical satellite positions with the same number of satellites, with each logical satellite position filled by the nearest satellite. Thus, the topology including the logical satellite positions, the air nodes, and the IoRT devices is fixed.
The above assumption naturally holds in SAGIN due to the following facts:
1) in reality, the time needed for satellite model aggregation through ground-air-space communication can be negligible for the slow-moving satellite to leave the current position; 2) when the satellite of each logical satellite position is switched, all air nodes only need to establish links with the newly arrived satellites and send the models to the satellites for aggregation, which does not change the air nodes corresponding to each logical satellite position.
Therefore, the exact position of the satellites does not matter. From a long-term perspective, the IoRT devices are loosely coupled with the satellites, meaning that the IoRT devices can be dynamically assigned to the nearest satellite according to the movements of satellites.

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the hierarchy of OBL, together with the non-IID data distribution among IoRT devices, may introduce new dimensions of data heterogeneity (e.g., in the space layer), leading to degraded global model performance. This negative impact can be dampened by carefully deciding the assignments between air nodes and satellites, which will be elaborated in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The feasibility of our OBL framework in the SAGIN scenarios can be fully guaranteed. Firstly, the hierarchical federated learning architecture can reduce the communication overhead, and delivering models instead of the raw data can help reduce the communication cost, which is compatible with the communication and storing capability of links in SAGIN. Moreover, model aggregation performed on the air nodes and satellites has low computing complexity and can be well adapted to the computing capability of the air nodes and satellites. Besides, model compression techniques, including quantization and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, can be easily adapted to our OBL framework to further reduce the communication, computation, and storage overhead.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To well suit the ring structure of satellites, the inter-satellite model synchronization can be realized by some decentralized alternatives to federated learning (e.g., the gossip protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> or the Ring Allreduce Algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>) that do not require a central control (e.g., a master satellite) to coordinate the synchronization, which can be triggered by the first satellite to complete the satellite model aggregation. Nevertheless, the gossip protocol requires all the satellites to frequently deliver models to their neighboring satellites such that each satellite’s model can be propagated through the whole satellite network, which incurs excessive communication overhead.
While Ring Allreduce algorithm reaps the benefits of model segmentation to deliver model parameters via one-hop communications between nearby satellites<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>For the cases where two neighboring satellites do not possess a direct link, we can use the ground station between them as the relay.</span></span></span> in parallel so that all the satellites can obtain a weighted average model in a fast manner.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In SAGIN, the assignment between air nodes and satellites is a dominant factor for the total communication time cost due to the limited inter-satellite link bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
For example, if an air node is assigned to the satellite far away from it, it may require a huge amount of relay satellites to help upload the model, resulting in expensive communication time costs.
To clearly depict the impact of the air node-satellite assignment on the communication time cost, we investigate the overall time cost of each global training round throughout the learning process.
In each global training round, the overall time cost includes the time cost of satellite model aggregation and inter-satellite model synchronization.
Within each satellite model aggregation, the time cost can be divided into two parts, namely communication time cost and computation time cost.

Specifically, we first divide the satellites and air nodes into several isolated partitions based on geographical locations to ensure that the model uploading from air nodes to satellites within each partition is communication-efficient, then assign the air nodes with diverse class distribution vectors to each satellite using a clustering-based approach.
The CNASA algorithm is expounded as follows.

Eventually, we obtain <math id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N_{geo}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1a"><msub id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mrow id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.2.cmml">g</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.3.cmml">e</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1a" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.4" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.4.cmml">o</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3"><times id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.2">𝑔</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.3">𝑒</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.4">𝑜</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.5.m5.1c">N_{geo}</annotation></semantics></math> clusters for each partition and each cluster contains <math id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N^{(i)}_{A}/N_{geo}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1a"><mrow id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.cmml"><msubsup id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.2.cmml">N</mi><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.3.cmml">A</mi><mrow id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.1.cmml">/</mo><msub id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.2.cmml">N</mi><mrow id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.2.cmml">g</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.3.cmml">e</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1a" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.4" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.4.cmml">o</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1b"><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2"><divide id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.1"></divide><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.2.2">𝑁</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.2.3">𝐴</ci></apply><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.2">𝑁</ci><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3"><times id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.2">𝑔</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.3">𝑒</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1.2.3.3.4">𝑜</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.6.m6.1c">N^{(i)}_{A}/N_{geo}</annotation></semantics></math> air nodes with large differences in class distribution to achieve high global model accuracy.</p>

Each partition can be treated as a graph, where clusters and satellites can be regarded as vertices in the graph, and the weight of the edge between each cluster vertex and each satellite vertex is the total model delivery time from the air nodes in each cluster to each satellite.
Our goal is to find a cluster-to-satellite mapping that minimizes the total time overhead of model uploading.
Thus, the cluster-to-satellite mapping is equivalent to the minimum weight matching in bipartite graphs.
We solve this problem using the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, a faster variant of the Hungarian algorithm.</p>

In practical deployment, the CNASA algorithm can be executed offline prior to the model training process by a ground station in a centralized manner. Following the virtual node strategy in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the network topology including the logical satellite positions, the air nodes, and the IoRT devices is fixed, so the air node-logical satellite position assignment can be computed first, then we just need to fill the logical satellite positions with the nearest satellite in real-time to obtain
the air node-satellite assignment. It is worth noting that the motion of satellites is not only highly dynamic but also periodic, so the network topology is also periodic. Therefore, the air nodes can send their geographic locations as well as the class distribution vectors to the ground station through the satellite network, and the air node-satellite assignments can be pre-calculated for a period and sent to all satellites over the satellite network by the ground station before the model training starts. For cases with the swift motion of satellites or a bigger inter-satellite model synchronization frequency (i.e., <math id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">τ</mi><mn id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.2">𝜏</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.4.m4.1c">\tau_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>), the connection link quality between the air nodes and their associated actual satellites may change greatly, we need to periodically apply the CNASA algorithm to improve the air node-satellite assignments.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-orbit satellite network is a satellite network composed of multiple orbital planes at the same altitude, which can provide wider network coverage.
To make our OBL framework more generally applicable, we introduce an extension of OBL that can adapt to the multi-orbit satellite network.
However, the introduction of the multi-orbit satellite network confronts the challenges of more complex network topology, model synchronization among different orbits, and harder-to-measure model delivery time.
These problems mainly emerge in three parts, the determination of each satellite’s coverage area, the inter-satellite model synchronization mechanism, and the geographical-distance-based division and cluster-to-satellite mapping in the CNASA algorithm.
Therefore, we elaborate our solution from these three parts.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recall that in a single-orbit satellite network, we divide the coverage area of all satellites equally according to the geographical locations of all satellites to determine the access satellite of each air node.
However, in a multi-orbit satellite network, the coverage of satellites become more complicated as the air nodes may be covered by multiple satellites in different orbits.
To fairly identify the air nodes that each satellite can directly connect to, we first construct a Voronoi diagram <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> based on the position of all satellites.
Perpendicular-based division in the Voronoi diagram allows air nodes to be divided to the closest satellites, thus ensuring fairness.
Specifically, we calculate the positions of the satellites’ projections on the earth’s surface and draw the Voronoi diagram based on the positions, where each satellite corresponds to a region called a Voronoi cell, and the boundaries of all regions in the Voronoi diagram serve as the fair boundaries.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In a multi-orbit satellite network,
the Ring Allreduce algorithm can still be used to synchronize the models within one orbit
due to the ring structure.
The key problem is, how to synchronize the models among different orbits after model synchronization within each orbit.
To address this issue, we first point out that at any time, there are inter-satellite links between any two orbits in the satellite network.
As an inherent characteristic, the satellite orbits are centered at the center of mass of the Earth and have equal radii, which ensures that there are intersections between any two satellite orbits, and the inter-satellite links between different orbits will exist around the intersections.
Although the satellites that establish inter-satellite links between different orbits at different times may change, as long as the inter-satellite links exist, model synchronization between orbits can be realized.
The Ring Allreduce algorithm can be used to efficiently synchronize the models of satellites around these intersections.
In fact, there is always more than one inter-satellite link between any two satellite orbits, but the model synchronization only needs to be performed once to avoid redundant synchronization.
In addition, if there are more than two satellites from different orbits around the intersection like the polar orbit satellite constellation, the Ring Allreduce algorithm can also be used to synchronize the models among all these satellites.
After model synchronization among different orbits, each orbit gets models from all the other orbits, so satellites within each orbit can perform the Ring Allreduce algorithm again to finish the inter-satellite model synchronization.
It is worth noting that the satellites not joining the model aggregation among different orbits just need to replace the chunks received when performing the Ring Allreduce algorithm.

That is, an air node will be assigned to the partition that its access satellite belongs to according to the Voronoi diagram in Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Determination of Each Satellite’s Coverage Area in Multi-Orbit Satellite Network ‣ V Extension to Multi-Orbit Satellite Network ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a> above.
Then, since the step of class-distribution-based clustering of the CNASA algorithm is not affected by the number of satellite orbits, this step does not need to be changed.
For the step of cluster-to-satellite mapping, the model delivery time from a source air node to a target satellite can be obtained based on the distance between the target satellite and the satellite that covers the source air node in the inter-satellite link graph, which has been computed in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ V-C The CNASA Algorithm in Multi-Orbit Satellite Network ‣ V Extension to Multi-Orbit Satellite Network ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

For ease of exposition, we target on the convergence analysis of OBL (with single or multiple orbits) after the CNASA algorithm is applied such that the associations between the IoRT devices, air nodes, and satellites are fixed until the global FL model is obtained. We will consider the challenging scenario that during the training process, the associations between the IoRT devices, air nodes, and satellites can dynamically change in future work.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Remember that the calculations of the local model, the satellite model, and the global model are stated in Definition <a href="#Thmdefinition1" title="Definition 1 (Olive Branch Learning). ‣ III-C Training Process of Olive Branch Learning ‣ III Olive Branch Learning Framework ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
We need to emphasize that the partial aggregation on the air nodes does not change the result of satellite model aggregation (because of the distributive law of multiplication), and the Ring Allreduce algorithm’s convergence to a consistent weighted average model in the distributed setting has been proven in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Thus, we omit the description of the partial aggregation and the Ring Allreduce algorithm here. The gradient divergence of the local model and the satellite model is defined in Definition <a href="#Thmdefinition2" title="Definition 2 (Gradient Divergence). ‣ VI Convergence Analysis of Olive Branch Learning ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which reflects the impact of differences in data distribution across devices (i.e., IoRT devices or satellites) on Olive Branch Learning.</p>

The LEO satellites are distributed in an equatorial orbital plane at an altitude of about 330 km, the air nodes are evenly distributed at a height of 100 m above the equator, and each air node is responsible for the model aggregation of two IoRT devices without overlapping.
The connectivity data between satellites and air nodes is obtained from Satellite Tool Kit (STK) simulation software.

Since our OBL framework does not impose any restrictions on training models for practical applications, it can meet the actual demands of SAGIN. Due to the page limit and the lack of the datasets of space applications, we will consider evaluating more relevant training tasks in future work. Each dataset consists of a training set for model training and a test set for model evaluation, and the specific explanation are as follows:</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed OBL framework is the first attempt to deploy FL into SAGIN scenarios by leveraging the unique characteristics of SAGIN such as system hierarchy and the specific topologies of different layers. Current popular FL algorithms (e.g., FedAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and Astraea <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>) can not be directly applied to the SAGIN scenarios due to the complex topology structure of SAGIN. Hence, we design OBL+GDO and OBL+CDO methods, deriving from FedAT and Astraea, respectively, to adapt to SAGIN scenarios, for comparison with our proposed OBL+CNASA algorithm. Our evaluation metrics include overall time cost of model training and final global model accuracy. The comparison methods are listed as follows:</p>

As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ VII-A2 Training settings ‣ VII-A Experiment Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the models trained by different methods (e.g., GDO, CNASA and CDO) on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets converge fast in the early stages of learning and stabilize to a stationary point after dozens of rounds. As a more challenging classification dataset, CIFAR-10 consumes more global training rounds to achieve a relatively stable model accuracy, and the final model accuracy is significantly lower than that on the other two datasets. Among these methods, the CDO method achieves the highest test accuracy throughout the learning process on all datasets, which is because, in the CDO method, each satellite can perform model aggregation for air nodes with the most diverse class distributions around the world, neglecting the air nodes’ geographic distance. However, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII-A2 Training settings ‣ VII-A Experiment Setup ‣ VII Performance Evaluation ‣ Olive Branch Learning: A Topology-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, CDO method requires more training time for model convergence, while our proposed CNASA algorithm can strike a nice balance between model accuracy and training efficiency.

both GDO and CNASA algorithms achieve the highest accuracy in IID case. As the degree of non-IID increases, the test accuracy of both the GDO method and our CNASA algorithm has decreased. However, the test accuracy of our CNASA algorithm is always higher than that of the GDO method, and as the degree of non-IID increases, the accuracy gap between our CNASA algorithm and the GDO method is getting bigger and bigger (e.g., in non-IID-1 case, the test accuracy of CNASA is 21% higher than that of the GDO).
Therefore, our CNASA algorithm is more robust to the data heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We further investigate the effect of the number of IoRT devices, air nodes and satellites in the SAGIN network on OBL algorithm with non-IID-2 case. As illustrated in Fig. <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:device</span>, the test accuracy of OBL continues to improve with the increase of the number of participating IoRT devices, as our OBL algorithm can leverage the rich data generated on more devices.

This is because that when the number of air nodes increases, each air node will cover a smaller number of IoRT devices, which can be seen as a finer-grained division of device data. Thus, our CNASA algorithm can conduct more elaborate air node-satellite assignment to mitigate the data heterogeneity and boost the model accuracy. Meanwhile, as the number of air nodes increases, so does the communication burden between satellite and air node, which will increase the time cost.</p>

The slight performance degradation at the case with 250 satellites is due to the serious non-IID data distribution at each satellite, as each satellite only in charge of two IoRT devices, indicating that the data samples for each satellite are from at most four classes (the data samples processed on each IoRT devices are from two classes in non-IID-2 case). Meanwhile, as the number of satellites grows, the communication load between satellites and air node decreases, allowing for greater bandwidth for each air node and hence lowering the time cost.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the efficiency of the Ring Allreduce algorithm in the inter-satellite model synchronization, we adopt the gossip protocol, a widely used aggregation algorithm in distributed systems, as the comparison algorithm. Specifically, in FL based on gossip protocol, each node sends its local model to its neighbor nodes, and the model is propagated node by node among the entire network. As illustrated in Fig. <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:Ring_vs_gossip</span>, the time cost of the gossip protocol is higher than that of the Ring Allreduce algorithm. This is because the frequent model delivery between satellites in the gossip protocol incurs excessive communication overhead, while the Ring Allreduce algorithm distributes computation and communication evenly over all satellites by making good use of the ring topology formed by the satellites, thus shortening the model delivery times effectively.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose OBL, a topology-aware federated learning framework for SAGIN, where the IoRT devices collaborate to train powerful models utilizing their local data with their privacy protected, and the nodes in the space layer and air layer serve as aggregation nodes.
To weaken the impact of non-IID data on IoRT devices and reduce the time cost of training a global model, we introduce the CNASA algorithm for OBL, which takes both the geographic distance and class distribution into account.
To adapt the OBL framework to the multi-orbit satellite network, we re-design the determination of each satellite’s coverage area, the inter-satellite model aggregation mechanism, and the CNASA algorithm.
We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the OBL framework.
Experiment results demonstrate that models trained using our proposed OBL framework can achieve satisfactory accuracy while reducing the time cost in both single-orbit and multi-orbit satellite networks, which can also be applied to tasks with diverse requirements for accuracy and time cost.
Additionally, the OBL framework is robust to the heterogeneity of local data and can efficiently aggregate the global model.
