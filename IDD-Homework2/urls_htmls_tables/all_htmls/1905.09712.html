<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Training task in classical machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, is generally implemented at a remote cloud center for centralized learning, which is typically time-consuming and resource-hungry. It also incurs serious privacy issue and long communication latency since a large amount of data are transmitted to the centralized node. To overcome these shortcomings, we consider a newly-emerged framework, namely <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</span>, to aggregate local learning updates at the network edge in lieu of users’ raw data. Aiming at accelerating the training process, we first define a novel performance evaluation criterion, called <span id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">learning efficiency</span>. We then formulate a training acceleration optimization problem in the CPU scenario, where each user device is equipped with CPU. The closed-form expressions for joint batchsize selection and communication resource allocation are developed and some insightful results are highlighted. Further, we extend our learning framework to the GPU scenario. The optimal solution in this scenario is manifested to have the similar structure as that of the CPU scenario, recommending that our proposed algorithm is applicable in more general systems. Finally, extensive experiments validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time and improve the learning accuracy simultaneously.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With AlphaGo defeating the world’s top Go player and the troika Y. Bengio, G. Hinton, and Y. LeCun winning the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">artifical intelligence</span> (AI) becomes one of the most cutting-edge techniques in both academia and industry communities and is envisioned as a revolutionary innovation enabling a smart earth in the future <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The implementation of AI in wireless networks is one of the most fundamental research directions, leading the trend of communication and computation convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The key idea of implementing AI in wireless networks is leveraging the rich data collected by massive distributed user devices to learn accurate AI models for network planning and optimization. Various conceptual and engineering AI breakthroughs have been applied to wireless network design, such as channel estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, signal detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In spite of the substantial progress in AI techniques, current learning algorithms demand enormous computation and memory resources for data processing. However, the training data in wireless networks is unevenly distributed over a large amount of resource-constrained user devices, whereas each device only owns a small fraction of data. Therefore, learning at devices suffers from isolated data island and will induce long training latency, making it hard to implement AI algorithms at user devices. Conventional solution generally offloads the local training data to a remote cloud center for centralized learning. Nevertheless, this method suffers from two key disadvantages. On the one hand, the latency for data transmission is often very large because of the limited communication resource. On the other hand, the privacy information involved in the training data may be leaked since the cloud center is inevitably attacked by some malicious third parties. Hence, traditional cloud-based learning framework is no longer suitable for the scenarios where data privacy is of paramount importance, such as intelligent healthcare systems and smart bank systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the first issue, an innovative architecture called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mobile edge computing</span> (MEC) has been developed by implementing cloud computation capability at the network edge and migrating learning tasks from the cloud center to the edge server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. By this means, the communication latency can be significantly reduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the mobile energy consumption can be extensively saved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and the core network congestion can be notably relieved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To overcome the second deficiency, a novel distributed learning framework, namely <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> (FL) has been proposed. The key idea of this framework is to aggregate locally computed learning updates (gradients or parameters) in a centralized node while keeping the privacy-sensitive data remained at local devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Toward this end, the benefit of the shared models trained from the rich data can be reaped and the computation resources of user devices can be exploited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Motivated by this, effective collaboration between MEC and FL, referred to as <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</span> (FEEL) has the great potential to facilitate the implementation of AI in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As an important branch of FL, FEEL implements the centralized node at the wireless edge to relieve core network congestion. It requires the joint design of machine learning and wireless communication. This paper makes use of FEEL to accelerate the training task of general deep neural networks (DNN). We are inspired by the prior studies on applying FEEL to learn AI models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a federated averaging algorithm for distributed learning was developed, while both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets were used for performance evaluation. Two approaches called structured updates and sketched updates were proposed to reduce communication cost between edge server and user devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In particular, substantial studies devoted great effort to reducing the communication overhead by developing effective compression methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Moreover, via creating a shared subset of data gathered from user devices, a collaborative learning strategy for non-IID data distributed system was developed to improve the learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In addition, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> investigated the multi-task system and proposed a system-aware optimization framework to balance the communication cost, stragglers, and fault tolerance. Besides, a block-chained FEEL architecture was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, where the optimal block generation rate was derived to minimize the end-to-end latency. Last but not least, a broadband analog aggregation scheme based on over-the-air computation was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, where two communication-and-learning trade-offs were developed to achieve a low-latency FEEL system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The prior works on FEEL mainly focus on accelerating the training task from the communication perspective, i.e., reducing the communication overhead between centralized node and user devices. However, the major characteristics of wireless communications (e.g., channel fadings and resource scheduling) have not been considered, which may greatly affect the learning performance. A joint user selection and resource allocation policy towards minimizing the loss function was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> by taking into account the impact of packet errors over wireless links. However, the optimization for the training task itself is also important and has not been investigated therein. To make progress, we consider the joint communication and computation resource allocation in this paper. In particular, both CPU and GPU scenarios are considered since DNN training is executed on either CPU or GPU. The major hyperparameter, i.e., the training batchsize is also optimized, which is of paramount importance to the learning performance improvement. This work is most related to the prominent FEEL works of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> developed a control algorithm to achieve the trade-off between local update and global aggregation under fixed resource budget and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a joint communication and computation resource allocation policy to balance the training time and energy consumption. We go one further step towards the training batchsize optimization from the learning perspective. Our main result shows that the training batchsize should dynamically adapt to the wireless channel condition to achieve the most desirable learning performance.

A novel criterion, namely <span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">learning efficiency</span> is developed as the ratio of the global loss decay to the end-to-end latency, which can well evaluate the system learning performance.</p>

Considering the heterogeneous data structure, we assume that local datasets are statistically independent across user devices. A shared DNN model (e.g., convolutional neural network, CNN) is distributed over all devices, which needs to be collaboratively trained across the devices using their local datasets. To leverage the rich data as well as preserve data privacy, we adopt the federated learning technique by iteratively aggregating the locally computed gradients at the edge server.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We focus on the gradient-averaging implementation in the subsequent exposition as the gradients can be significantly compressed by some compression methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span> We introduce the learning mechanism by describing the steps that the communication parties take.

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.4" class="ltx_p">The durations of uplink and downlink time-slots are relatively short (e.g., the frame duration of LTE protocol is 10 ms), during which the channel gains keep fixed. However, the duration of one communication round is often in the time-scale of second. It is because of the high computational complexity in running the backpropagation algorithm and the limited computation resource of user devices. Toward this end, each communication round will experience multiple time-slots. Since this work focuses on accelerating the training task from the long-term perspective, the channel dynamics would not affect the learning performance too much. Thus, we employ the average uplink and downlink data rates instead of the instantaneous ones, which are respectively evaluated as</p>

In particular, the batchsize of each device varies across different communication rounds because of the channel dynamics. This result is intuitive and plays an important role in hyperparameter tuning. On the one hand, it theoretically guides devices to increase the batchsize when the local training speed increases or the channel condition becomes better. On the other hand, the device with a higher training priority ratio is suggested to choose a larger batchsize since it is superior to speed up the model convergence.

<p id="Thmrem3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Theorem 1 indicates that the optimal uplink resource allocation depends not only on the uplink data rate and the local training speed, but also on the training batchsize. Specifically, this solution guarantees that the edge server can receive all local gradients simultaneously. Therefore, the end-to-end latency of each device can be equalized and thus facilitate the update synchronization needed for gradient aggregation. This result also guides devices to balance the communication and computation costs, and thus can be regarded as a communication-and-computation trade-off. Concisely, the amount of time-slot resource decreases with the uplink data rate since the device with better channel quality requests less communication resource. In addition, when the local training speed decreases, the device should occupy more time-slot resources to reduce its end-to-end latency.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the serial mode of CPU, GPU execute in the parallel mode. Therefore, the local gradient calculation latency is no longer proportional to the training batchsize. Specifically, when the training batchsize is small, GPU can directly process all data simultaneously, leading to a constant training latency. In contrary, it grows once the training batchsize exceeds the maximum number of data that it can process at a time. With this consideration, we propose a new function to capture the relation between the local gradient calculation latency and the training batchsize, as presented in the following assumption and shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ V-A GPU Training Function ‣ V Extension to GPU Scenario ‣ Accelerating DNN Training in Wireless Federated Edge Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>.</p>

In this case, the data samples are inadequate such that the computation resource (e.g., the video memory) is not fully exploited. Therefore, we name it as the <span id="Thmrem6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data bound</span> region. On the other hand, the local gradient calculation latency grows linearly when the training batchsize exceeds the threshold. It is because in this case, the computation resource cannot support processing all data samples simultaneously. We note that the local gradient calculation latency does not increase in a ladder form. The reason is rather intuitive that the operations of data reading and transferring between memory modules and processing modules need additional time, leading to a comprehensive linear trend. Consequently, we name this region as the <span id="Thmrem6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">compute bound</span> region.

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We test both the convergence speed and the learning accuracy of each DNN model with different learning rates. To be more realistic, we implement the non-IID case and the results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-B CPU Scenario: Generalization Ability with Different DNN Models ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Accelerating DNN Training in Wireless Federated Edge Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. It can be observed that the proposed scheme is capable of attaining a desired learning accuracy with fast convergence speed for all models. Moreover, the ultimate learning accuracy can be well guaranteed with different learning rates. This result demonstrates the strong generalization ability of the proposed algorithm, which promotes its wide implementation in practical systems.</p>

The results are illustrated in Table II(b). It can be observed that the proposed scheme can still achieve the fastest training speed as well as attain a desired learning accuracy among all schemes, which demonstrates its superiority and scalability. Moreover, as the number of devices increases, the training speed improvement of the proposed scheme become more evident than that of the individual learning scheme. It is because with more devices, the proposed scheme can exploit more computation resources to train the DNN model. In particular, the accuracy gap between IID and non-IID cases in the individual learning scheme is larger than those in other schemes. As we can imagine, the individual learning scheme cannot grasp the characteristic of the non-IID data because it performs local training without collaboration. Conversely, other three schemes periodically aggregate the local learning updates, making the accuracy gaps between IID and non-IID cases much smaller. This result also suggests the superiority of the proposed scheme to deal with the non-IID data in FEEL systems.</p>

We can observe from all plots that the proposed scheme can achieve the fastest convergence speed while attaining the highest learning accuracy at the same time. The reason is that the proposed scheme can optimally allocate the time-slot resource and select appropriate training batchsize to balance the communication and computation costs. Further, the learning accuracy of the proposed scheme in the IID and non-IID cases are almost the same. It is because the edge server can aggregate the gradient information from all devices in each communication round. Therefore, the global gradient is approximately an unbiased estimate of the stochastic gradient in both IID and non-IID cases. Toward this end, the learning accuracy in the non-IID case will not deteriorate as compared with that in the IID case. This also demonstrates the applicability of the proposed scheme in practical systems with non-IID data.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims at accelerating the DNN training task in FEEL. The key idea is to jointly optimize local training batchsize and communication resource allocation to achieve fast training speed while maintaining learning accuracy. In the common CPU scenario, we formulate a training acceleration problem and develop a joint batchsize selection and communication resource allocation policy in closed form. Some insightful results are also discussed to provide meaningful guidelines for hypeparameter adjustment and network planning. We further extend the training acceleration problem to the GPU scenario. The optimal solution in this case can be derived by fine-tuning the result in the CPU scenario, recommending that the proposed algorithm is applicable in more general systems. Our studies in this work provide an important step towards the implementation of AI in wireless communication systems.</p>
