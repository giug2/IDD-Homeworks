<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning shows promise as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning technique. Existing heterogeneous federated learning mainly focuses on skewing the label distribution across clients. However, most approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and concept drift, mainly when the global distribution of all classes is extremely unbalanced and the data distribution of the client dynamically evolves over time. In this paper, we study the new task, i.e., Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL), which addresses the practical scenario where heterogeneous data distributions exist among different clients and dynamic tasks within the client. Accordingly, we propose a novel federated learning framework named Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) and design federated multi-level regularizations. To mitigate concept drift, we construct prototypes and semantic prototypes to provide fruitful generalization knowledge and ensure the continuity of prototype spaces. To maintain the model stability and consistency of convergence, three regularizations are introduced as training losses, i.e., prototype-based regularization, semantic prototype-based regularization, and federated inter-task regularization. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various settings.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a significant research area that addresses the challenges of collaborative machine learning in decentralized and privacy-sensitive settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
Instead of centralizing data on a single server, FL models are trained locally on distributed devices such as smartphones to preserve data privacy.
Parameters from local models of clients are aggregated to create a global model that represents the collective knowledge of all participating edge devices.
This paradigm enables collaborative learning without compromising data privacy and security.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity is an inevitable issue as different edge devices participating in collaborative learning collect data based on personal preferences.
There are significant differences in the underlying data distribution among the participants, resulting in their models being optimized according to local empirical risk minimization and further causing inconsistency in global optimization.
To address this problem, most previous methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Afonin and Karimireddy <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>; Gao et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduce global information to adjust the optimization direction of participants’ local models, aiming to obtain a generalized global model.
Meanwhile, some other approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li and Wang <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Liang et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Collins et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>
argue that it could be better for some clients to use their limited local data to train a personalized local model.
However, these approaches model in the static scenario of data heterogeneity and assume that the global class data is uniformly distributed while data within clients is fixed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In practical scenarios, the data distribution is unbalanced or even long-tailed, and the client dynamically receives new data.
For instance, smartphones generate data throughout the day, and hospitals in the healthcare system periodically collect patient records. To accommodate this situation, we introduce a novel challenging problem, i.e., Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL), as illustrated in Figure <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Multi-Level Prototypes" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. For this task, there are diversified and unbalanced data distributions across clients and dynamic incremental tasks within the client.
The limited number of samples for rare classes leads to bias in both the local and aggregated global models.
The incremental arrival within the client causes <em id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local catastrophic forgetting</em>, i.e., local model updating to overfit the current data distribution and forget the knowledge of previous data distributions.
The aggregated model would quickly get into a local optimum and incur <em id="Sx1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global concept drift</em> as the updated local model can be heavily biased toward majority classes in the current task distribution.
Existing FL methods typically perform poorly for this task due to a lack of consideration for prevalent long-tail and dynamic data distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address this problem, we introduce the Federated Multi-Level Prototype (FedMLP), which leverages intrinsic relations to build federated multi-level regularizations, enabling model stability training to achieve convergence consistency.
To mitigate the global concept drift exacerbated by the inconsistency of class distribution across clients and the imbalance of global class distribution, we introduce both prototype-based regularization and semantic prototype-based regularization.
These federated regularizations ensure that minority classes can leverage features from balanced semantic prototypes, thereby rectifying their own prototype representations. Consequently, local models are less biased towards dominant classes and show consistent performance in disadvantaged domains, thereby reducing the bias of the aggregated global classifier.
To address the local forgetting caused by dynamic incremental tasks within the client, we design the federated inter-task regularization, whose goal is to synchronize the recognized class prototypes of the current task with the class models of previous tasks. This regularization further reduces the bias introduced by inconsistent data samples and promotes feature similarity within the same class in different tasks.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning with Data Heterogeneous.</span> Federated learning aims to facilitate collaborative model training across distributed devices or clients while preserving data locality.
The heterogeneity among edge devices introduces data heterogeneity, leading to the global concept drift and consequently affecting overall performance. Following the seminal work FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, which trains a global model by aggregating local model parameters, typical models such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, pFedME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Durmus et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> mitigate the heterogeneity problem by relying primarily on the global penalty or aim to control the variance by calculating the global parameter stiffness.
Furthermore, since the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is mainly concentrated in the labels, some other methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Collins et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> propose learning shared data representations across clients. The MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li, He, and Song <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, FedProto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, and FedProc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mu et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> aim to maximize feature-level consistency between local and global models.
These methods focus on resolving the data heterogeneity across clients while ignoring that, in reality, the global class distribution is extremely skewed or long-tailed, which would exacerbate the impact of this problem.
To address this issue, GRP-FED <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">2021GRP</span>)</cite>, Ratio loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Afonin and Karimireddy <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, FEDIC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shang et al. <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>)</cite>, and CReFF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shang et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> propose distillation using logits adjustment and calibration gate networks. However, these approaches require additional discriminators and public data, burdening participants or the server side. Moreover, they ignore that realistic federated learning environments typically involve multiple participants, each of which may experience different task increments and data changes.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Continual Federated Learning.</span> Catastrophic forgetting is a significant problem for continual federated learning. To alleviate this problem, existing works usually use the client to store the data of the old class internally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, or apply the loss function to compensate for the forgetting of the old class, or extract the cross-task consistent inter-class relationship <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dong et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, or use an independent unlabeled proxy dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ma et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
However, these methods focus on the forgetting caused by the incremental learning of classes within the client and ignore the incremental learning of different tasks, i.e., the forgetting problem caused by the inconsistent class distribution between tasks.
The closely related method FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yoon et al. <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> uses client-side network parameter decomposition to reduce interference between different tasks. However, it involves cross-client migration, and each round of communication requires computational resources and time to handle weight adjustment and information transfer, resulting in increased training time.
The FedNTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> uses the global model to predict the locally available data to solve the forgetting caused by the data heterogeneity but requires the global model to be unbiased to avoid similar trends in the trained local model. In this paper, we introduce a consensus optimization of global semantic prototypes, i.e., knowledge complements for similarity classes and local prior prototype knowledge to learn a generalizable global model as well as robust and stable local models during federated learning.</p>

These approaches facilitate training customized models tailored to each distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caldarola et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. The CPCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Huang et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> uses clustering strategies to select representative prototypes and addresses the FL problem with the domain transfer. In our approach, we use prototype clustering to mine relationships between minority classes and their similar classes, thereby addressing the bias in the global classifier. In addition, we perform initialization for newly introduced classes to reduce the introduced bias and enable faster convergence to their optimal representation.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the problem of local catastrophic forgetting, the primary goal is to ensure that prototypes of old classes do not exhibit significant biases in the current task while effectively training prototypes of new classes.
For newly introduced classes, we deem that the initialization of a well-generalized representation should not only have clear decision boundaries but also be as general as possible to the similar old class feature space. Thus, it can provide a stable direction of convergence to quickly adapt the model to new tasks.</p>

This reduces communication overhead and improves privacy. Compared with existing methods that utilize the global model to construct regularization terms, the size of the prototype is much smaller than the model parameters, which reduces the computational cost for participants. In addition, model updates use prototype knowledge stored from previous tasks without compromising privacy. The semantic prototype remains privacy-preserving by undergoing two averaging operations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

Notably, the FEMNIST dataset contains 62 classes, each containing 600 samples.
For fair comparisons with existing works, we use a 5-layer CNN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> for the MNIST datasets and utilize the ResNet-18 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kaiming He and Sun <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> for the CIFAR datasets.</p>

We take the accuracy average over the last ten communication epochs as the final performance. To verify whether the proposed method mitigates the forgetting problem when maintaining continual learning, the test set of the current task includes the corresponding test sets of all previous tasks. In addition, a balanced test set containing all samples is used to evaluate both the private models of individual clients and the global model.

The results indicate that FedMLP exhibits faster convergence and more prominent results than other methods, despite the extreme imbalance in the global class distribution. Notably, the CreFF approach is designed to address federated global class imbalances but exhibits poor performance. Due to the incremental task within the clients, the local models tend to forget previously learned information, resulting in poor generalization of the trained balanced federated features.
The performance of the FedProto method remains static across epochs due to the inherent deviation between computed and expected prototypes for limited data.</p>

In Figure <a href="#Sx4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Model Analysis ‣ Experiments ‣ Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Multi-Level Prototypes" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we compare the average accuracy of the local models after introducing a new task within the client. It can be seen that catastrophic forgetting in local models is inevitable due to the inconsistent distribution of local models across tasks. Compared to other methods, the proposed FedMLP exhibits a more gradual decay, indicating a smoother state of forgetting. FedNTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> shows promising results as it is specifically designed to counteract forgetting caused by diverse distributions.

a similar decline in the accuracy of the minority class as new tasks are introduced. The proposed FedMLP also displays a more gradual attenuation trend compared to other methods, implying that classes with limited samples can achieve comparable performance to those with abundant samples.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a novel task named Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL) and thoroughly investigate the associated issues, which encompass local catastrophic forgetting and global concept drift. To address these challenges, we present a novel Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) framework coupled with federated multi-level regularizations.
We conduct a comprehensive study on the DHFL using various experimental settings on four important benchmarks. Our proposed method significantly beats the recent state-of-the-art federated learning methods, while ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each regularization.
FedMLP could effectively train a robust and generalized federated model with excellent results while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead.</p>
