<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a client selection method for federated learning (FL) when the computation and communication resource of clients cannot be estimated; the method trains a machine learning (ML) model using the rich data and computational resources of mobile clients without collecting their data in central systems.
Conventional FL with client selection estimates the required time for an FL round from a given clients’ computation power and throughput and determines a client set to reduce time consumption in FL rounds.
However, it is difficult to obtain accurate resource information for all clients before the FL process is conducted because the available computation and communication resources change easily based on background computation tasks, background traffic, bottleneck links, etc.
Consequently, the FL operator must select clients through exploration and exploitation processes.
This paper proposes a multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based client selection method to solve the exploration and exploitation trade-off and reduce the time consumption for FL in mobile networks. The proposed method balances the selection of clients for which the amount of resources is uncertain and those known to have a large amount of resources.
The simulation evaluation demonstrated that the proposed scheme requires less learning time than the conventional method in the resource fluctuating scenario.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Collaborative machine learning (ML), which leverages the data and computational resources of mobile devices to train ML models, has attracted substantial attention.
Currently, there are nearly 7 billion connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices worldwide <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and 3 billion smartphones.
These devices have increasingly advanced sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, and these resources can be used to empower modern artificial intelligence (AI) products via cutting-edge ML techniques.
Federated learning (FL), which is a framework of collaborative ML, trains an ML model using the rich data and computational resources of the mobile clients without collecting their data in central systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In FL, an edge server or a cloud server assigns ML tasks to mobile clients and gathers the models updated by the mobile clients using their own data, instead of gathering data and training models by itself.
Because the data is kept in the local storage of mobile clients, private data can be used to train the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One bottleneck for FL is the latency caused by wireless transmission and local computation on clients, especially when the number of participating clients in the FL process is large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
This is because mobile clients with differing wireless-link qualities and computational capabilities must update and communicate a several-gigabyte ML model.
One important approach to reducing the training latency in FL is client selection.
The FL operator must determine how much bandwidth should be allocated to each client in order to determine which clients should participate in FL.
Many client selection methods in FL have been proposed in existing studies.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, client selection algorithms that maximize the number of selected clients in each round were studied to increase accuracy improvement per round.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a client scheduling algorithm to jointly consider the staleness of the received parameters and the instantaneous channel qualities.
A joint scheduling of wireless resources and client scheduling was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
These studies assume that accurate resource information (e.g., throughput, channel state, and available computation power of clients) is given, and it is assumed that the amount of resources is stable in a round.
However, to obtain the resource information before conducting FL processes, resource measurements are required (e.g., beaconing, throughput prediction, and computation load estimation), which consume computation and communication resources.
Moreover, the obtained resource information may not always be accurate and stable in the FL processes due to background computation tasks, background traffic, unstable wireless link quality, and network congestion.
Therefore, the existing client selection approach based on the ideal assumption for resource information could suffer from large performance degradation induced by mismatch between the mathematically obtained optimal selection and the actual optimal selection in practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a trial-and-error based client selection algorithm based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm for use in situations in which the client resources are not exactly determined.
We achieve more efficient scheduling by performing exploration, which selects clients that are selected less frequently, and exploitation, which selects clients with rich resources, and balancing them effectively.
The MAB problem is a sequential decision problem, where the player selects an arm in each timeslot and observes the reward (payoff).
The aim of the MAB problem is to determine the arm so as to maximize the total reward obtained in sequential selections.
The application of MAB to resource scheduling in wireless networks has been widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Our main contribution is providing a FL protocol that incorporates MAB as a method for solving the client selection problem in realistic environments wherein the client resources are uncertain and fluctuate.
The proposed client selection algorithm finds and leverages resource-rich clients by trial and error based on MAB to improve the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the FL.
We evaluate our method using realistic large-scale training simulations involving neural networks for image classification, with a cellular network as the simulation environment.
The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves higher classification accuracy than the existing protocol when the client resources are highly variable.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The system model follows a model described in a previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
We consider a certain platform, which is located in a cellular network and consists of an edge server and a base station (BS).
The FL server manages the behaviors of the server and clients in the FL protocol.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We assume that there is a fixed number of resource blocks (RBs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> available in the cell and that they are shared among the clients.
In addition, if multiple clients communicate with the server simultaneously, the throughput for each client decreases accordingly.
We also assume that the modulation and coding schemes for radio communication are determined suitably for each client, while considering its channel state and packet-loss rate to be negligible.
This leads to different throughput for each client communicating with the server, although the number of allocated RBs is constant.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This work considers that the client resource information consists of two values: the time needed for the client to update the model, and the time needed to upload the model to the FL server.
In addition, we assume that all clients’ model update times and throughputs fluctuate based on a certain distribution that is unknown to the FL operator.
Some clients consume communication and computational resources owing to tasks unrelated to FL.
Therefore, it is natural to assume that the resources are variable.
A client’s model update time and model upload time are set to the actual times consumed by participating in FL.
When a client is selected and participates in FL, the resource information is updated with the new values.
The client notifies the server of the values until the client is selected again.
Note that clients participating in FL for the first time notify the server that their model update time and model upload time are <math id="S2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math> s.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Here, we consider naively applying MAB to the client selection problem.
The typical application of MAB is slot machine selection, in which a player selects an arm of slot machine from multiple slot machines.
The player selects and plays an arm, after which they obtain a reward.
By repeating this trial-and-error process, the player learns a strategy to optimally select an arm to maximize the expected reward.
In MAB, the selection problem is formulated as a problem of selecting an arm from among multiple arms so that the cumulative reward is maximized.
In the UCB algorithm, the player selects an arm based on the following UCB score:</p>

By applying the MAB naively to the client selection, the arms of the MAB correspond to sets of clients.
The MAB algorithm struggles to converge because the number of arms increases combinatorially as the number of clients increases.
Specifically, in FL, the number of arms reaches on the order of ten to the tenth power or more, since about ten clients are selected in each round from among approximately a thousand clients.</p>

The right-hand side is the UCB score.
The less frequently a client is selected, the smaller the amendment term of the client will be.
Therefore, clients with a small number of selections are more likely to be selected, even if the client’s round times are long.
This algorithm aims to directly reduce the round time by utilizing the reward setting.
However, convergence is not guaranteed by this UCB adaptation because the reward depends on the other clients’ payoff.</p>

Therefore, clients with a small number of selections are more likely to be selected, even if the client’s model upload time and model update time are relatively long.
In this algorithm, the payoffs are determined independently for each client;
consequently, it is expected that resource-rich clients can be selected more efficiently.</p>

Further, we set the model parameters as follows.
The carrier frequency was 2.5 GHz; the antenna heights of the BS and clients were 11 and 1 m respectively; and the transmission power and antenna gain of the BS and clients were 20 and 0 dBi, respectively.
As a practical bandwidth limitation, we assumed that 10 RBs, which corresponded to a bandwidth of 1.8 MHz, were assigned to a client in each time slot of 0.5 ms.
The throughput model was based on the Shannon capacity with a certain loss used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> with <math id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Delta=1.6" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">Δ</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1.6</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">Δ</ci><cn type="float" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">1.6</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\Delta=1.6</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rho_{\mathrm{max}}=4.8" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">ρ</mi><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">max</mi></msub><mo id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">4.8</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝜌</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3">max</ci></apply><cn type="float" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">4.8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1c">\rho_{\mathrm{max}}=4.8</annotation></semantics></math>.

This result shows that the evaluation values of the clients converged to a certain value.
It shows that MAB-based selection algorithms can obtain certain policies.
In addition, because the two algorithms assigned their largest evaluation values to different clients, it is clear that they follow different client selection policies.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presented a MAB-based client selection method that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation caused in the client selection problem in which the client resources fluctuate and are uncertain until the FL round is conducted.
Our formulation and algorithm design, which fits with FL client selection, enables reduction of the FL latency induced by selecting resource-poor clients.
Subsequently, we conducted simulations by performing realistic ML tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol.
Our simulation results revealed that our proposed algorithm achieved shorter learning times than FedCS when resources fluctuated widely.
Future work should consider a setting in which clients’ average resource usage will fluctuate during an FL operation.</p>
