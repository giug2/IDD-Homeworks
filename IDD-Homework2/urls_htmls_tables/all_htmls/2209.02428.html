<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text">As an edge intelligence algorithm for multi-device collaborative training, federated learning (FL) can reduce the communication burden but increase the computing load of wireless devices. In contrast, split learning (SL) can reduce the computing load of devices by using model splitting and assignment, but increase the communication burden to transmit intermediate results. In this paper, to exploit the advantages of FL and SL, we propose a hybrid federated split learning (HFSL) framework in wireless networks, which combines the multi-worker parallel update of FL and flexible splitting of SL. To reduce the computational idleness in model splitting, we design a parallel computing scheme for model splitting without label sharing, and theoretically analyze the influence of the delayed gradient caused by the scheme on the convergence speed. Aiming to obtain the trade-off between the training time and energy consumption, we optimize the splitting decision, the bandwidth and computing resource allocation. The optimization problem is multi-objective, and we thus propose a predictive generative adversarial network (GAN)-powered multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the Pareto front of the problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in finding Pareto optimal solutions, and the solutions of the proposed HFSL dominate the solution of FL.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the booming development of Internet of things (IoT), abundant data is produced by IoT devices every day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Based on the large amount of distributed data, edge machine learning algorithms are flourishing to realize intelligent applications in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To enable multiple wireless devices to collaboratively train a machine learning algorithm with their local data, federated learning (FL) is proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Compared with traditional centralized learning that transmits huge amounts of raw data to the cloud server for training, FL can effectively protect the privacy of data without exchanging the local data. Meanwhile, since only the global model is uploaded and downloaded in each round of FL training, FL generally reduce the communication load compared to transmitting raw data. However, the IoT devices, also called workers, are required to perform a local update of the training model with local computing power in FL. This can greatly increase the computation burden of the workers, especially for training deep neural networks with high computational complexity. When the computing power of workers is low, the training time of FL is greatly extended, which affects the practical application of FL. In addition, local updating entirely by the own computing power of workers increases their energy consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike FL, split learning (SL) can split a deep neural network into multiple parts and deliver them to different computational nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, such as workers and edge servers. Through multi-tier computing, the computation burden and energy consumption of a single node can be significantly reduced. However, the intermediate output or gradient of the neural network needs to be transmitted between different computational nodes in SL, yielding a huge communication burden. Besides, due to the data dependency in the forward and backward propagation of neural network training, the computation of the later node has to wait for the required data to be transmitted from the previous node. These two issues can prolong the training time of SL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Through the above comparison, we can find that FL and SL are complementary in terms of the communication resource consumption of the learning system and computing power requirement of workers. FL requires few communication resources to transmit global models infrequently, but requires workers with powerful computing power to complete local updates.In contrast, SL does not require workers with strong computing power but requires lots of communication resources to frequently transmit intermediate results of neural networks. Inspired by this, if we reasonably combine FL and SL, a trade-off between the training time of the learning system and the energy consumption of workers can be achieved under limited communication and computing resources.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For utilizing the multi-worker parallel update of FL and the low computational requirement for workers of SL to improve training speed, the combination of FL and SL has been considered in many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, all the workers split the neural network into the worker-side part and the server-side part. The server updates the parameters of the server-side part in parallel after receiving the intermediate output of the worker-side part from all users, while the parameters of the worker-side part need to be transmitted to the server for global averaging. For large-scale workers in a learning system, workers are divided into multiple groups in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where the server-side part of each group and each worker-side perform a global average respectively to obtain the global model. For reducing the frequent communication between workers and the server, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> use an auxiliary light-weight neural network and a loss function to update the parameters of the worker-side part without the participation of the server-side part. FL and SL are combined to train a large natural language processing model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, where the model can be split and distributed to multiple workers and then updated one by one for sequentially partitioned data. The combination of FL and SL is extended to multi-task learning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> with the shared server-side part and task-specific worker-side part. However, existing works combining FL and SL take the same splitting decision for all workers, without optimizing the splitting decision based on heterogeneous computing and communication resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent works have realized parallel computing between different computational nodes through a reasonable arrangement of communication and computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to reduce the waiting time in SL caused by the data dependency of neural networks. With the neural network split and assigned to different workers, workers can asynchronously train with multiple minibatches of data at the same time in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> based on the careful arrangement of multiple computing flows, thereby reducing computational idleness. For accelerating training, the multiple computing flows in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> are assigned different priorities according to the urgency level of the parameter. A layer-wise communication scheduler is designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to make parameter transmission and computation overlap as much as possible. Similarly, the computation and communication of neural network training are partitioned with a greedy algorithm to overlap gradient communication with backward computation and parameter communication with forward computation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. However, these parallel mechanisms are designed for split learning with label sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and cannot be directly applied to the case without label sharing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain a trade-off solution of a multi-objective problem, a common method is to weight the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem with variable parameters, which requires prior information about the objective preference. Besides, many classic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are proposed, such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Moreover, numerous model-based MOEAs are proposed using the decision variable clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Gaussian process-based inverse modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, dominance relationship classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, Pareto rank learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, etc. In general, the performance of these model-based MOEAs degrades as decision variables increase due to the increase of computational complexity and data requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the generative adversarial network (GAN) with strong learning ability is applied to multi-objective optimization for generating potential solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> are proposed to deal with multi-objective optimization problems with sequential decision making.</p>

In the forward propagation of model splitting, the output feature of <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> needs to be uploaded to the server for the calculation of <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part b</em>, and the execution of <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part c</em> depends on the output of <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part b</em>. Similar data dependency exists in the backward propagation because the gradient calculation of the current layer requires the gradient of the previous layer based on the chain rule. Besides, as the backward propagation requires the output value of the hidden layer obtained by the forward propagation, the backward propagation of a minibatch of data can be performed after completing the forward propagation of this minibatch.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The data dependency in the forward and backward propagation of DNN training leads to the worker idleness in vanilla model splitting as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B.

For example, during the period from the completion of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> to the start of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part c</em> in the forward propagation, the worker has to wait for uploading the output of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em>, the calculation of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part b</em> by the server and downloading the output of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part b</em>. This idleness causes the inefficient execution of model splitting. To alleviate this problem, we design a parallel computing mechanism for model splitting as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B. Yin, Z. Chen and M. Tao are with the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, P. R. China. Email: {yinbsh, zhiyongchen, mxtao}@sjtu.edu.cn. (Corresponding author: Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (b). In the vanilla model splitting, the worker cooperates with the server to perform sequential iterations, that is, the next minibatch of data is processed after the forward and backward propagation of the previous minibatch is completed. In the proposed parallel computing schemd, to improve the execution efficiency, when the forward propagation of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> of the first minibatch is completed, the worker starts to calculate <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> of the second minibatch. When the output of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part b</em> of the first minibatch is downloaded to the worker, the worker uploads the output of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> of the second minibatch while starting to calculate the forward and backward propagation of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.10" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part c</em> of the first minibatch. Subsequent iterations follow a similar arrangement, resulting in stage 1 to 4 in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B. Yin, Z. Chen and M. Tao are with the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, P. R. China. Email: {yinbsh, zhiyongchen, mxtao}@sjtu.edu.cn.

In each stage, a forward and a backward propagation of <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.11" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part a</em> or <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.12" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">part c</em> is calculated locally. Each stage starts with the uploading to the server, and ends with the completion of downloading from the server or local computing. By this method, the worker-side calculation of other minibatches is inserted into the idle time of the worker in the vanilla model splitting.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the mismatch between the time consumption of worker computing and edge computing also causes the worker to be idle or waiting. For example, in the stage 1 of Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B. Yin, Z. Chen and M. Tao are with the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, P. R. China. Email: {yinbsh, zhiyongchen, mxtao}@sjtu.edu.cn.

In this case, the CPU frequency of the worker is too high, which leads to idleness and increases the energy consumption of the worker. So the CPU frequency of the worker can be reduced to save unnecessary energy consumption in this case. In another case, such as stage 3 of Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B. Yin, Z. Chen and M. Tao are with the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, P. R. China. Email: {yinbsh, zhiyongchen, mxtao}@sjtu.edu.cn.

So in this case, the CPU frequency of the worker can be increased to reduce the waiting time. Considering these two cases, we adopt an adaptive local computing frequency as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Parallel Computing for Model Splitting ‣ II System Model ‣ Predictive GAN-powered Multi-Objective Optimization for Hybrid Federated Split Learning B.

This is because optimizing these variables in each round requires full knowledge of the channel conditions in each round, which is difficult in the practical system.

<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The optimization problem is multi-objective, which is based on the trade-off between time and energy consumption. Increasing the number of workers with model splitting can reduce the energy consumption of the splitting workers, but it can also reduce the computing power allocated by the server to each worker and increase the training time. Thus, we can try to find as many Pareto optimal solutions as possible, instead of a single optimal policy. Meanwhile, the optimization problem is non-convex, and it is generally hard to obtain the set of Pareto-dominating solutions for such a problem. Therefore, a predictive GAN powered multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem in the following sections.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first analyze the convergence rate of the proposed HFSL because the delayed gradient update may affect the convergence rate. Although the existing convergence analyses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> consider the delayed gradient, the cause of their delayed gradient is different from this paper. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, workers start the next round of local updates at the same time as global averaging, causing a delay between the arrival of the averaged gradient to workers and the local update. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, gradients uploaded by workers to the server can be delayed due to asynchronous parameter aggregation. In this paper, the delayed gradient is due to the parallelism between different minibatches of data. Another difference is that we consider the heterogeneous workers, and the delayed gradient only exists on the workers with splitting. We then theoretically derive the number of global rounds required to reach the desired performance in this section.</p>

Similar to many MOEAs, NSGA-III generally has three steps: offspring generation, solution evaluation and solution selection. To generate offspring solutions, genetic operators (i.e., crossover and mutation) are used based on the parent solutions. Then the offspring solutions are evaluated with the optimized function. After evaluation, the parent and offspring solutions are combined to select new parent solutions for the next generation. These steps are repeated for many generations until the termination criterion is satisfied. To select new parent solutions, the definition of Pareto dominance is necessary.</p>

Next, the discriminator is trained to learn the relationship between the dominated solutions and the dominating solutions using the dominance pairs. Finally, the generator is trained with the parameters of discriminator frozen to produce better solutions based on the dominating solutions. These steps are repeated until the termination criterion is satisfied. The details about the dominance pair and the training of GAN are introduced in the following subsections.</p>

For a fair comparison, the generator of GMOEA has the same number of nodes as the proposed algorithm. The discriminator of GMOEA is also a two-layer FCNN, and the number of the input nodes, intermediate nodes, and output nodes is 64, 64, and 1, respectively. The solution selection method of NSGA-III is applied to classify solutions in GMOEA. For the NSGA-III, the SBX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> and the polynomial mutation (PM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> are used to generate offspring solutions with the distribution index of crossover and mutation both set as 20.

We can see that the performance of the Pareto front obtained by the proposed algorithm is better than the other two algorithms, which is reflected in the less energy consumption for the same training time, and less training time for the same energy consumption. Moreover, we compare the Pareto dominating solutions of the designed HFSL with the solution with no model splitting, i.e., FL. We can observe from the figure that the point without splitting is dominated by some solutions obtained by the three algorithms.</p>

For the training time of these three algorithms, the time required for the proposed algorithm, GMOEA, and NSGA-III to train for 2000 generations (almost converged) is 515.7, 483.6, and 44 seconds, respectively. The time consumption of the proposed algorithm and GMOEA are approximate, and their training time is mainly spent on the training of the neural network.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a hybrid federated split learning framework to utilize the multi-worker parallel update and low communication burden of FL and the low computational requirement for workers of SL to reduce the training time and energy consumption. To reduce the computational idleness of workers with model splitting, we designed a parallel computing scheme for model splitting without label sharing. Convergence analysis shows that the delayed gradient update introduced by the parallel computing scheme does not affect the convergence rate. Then we formulated a multi-objective optimization problem to find the Pareto-optimal solution set of splitting decisions and resource allocation for the proposed HFSL. To solve the problem, we proposed a predictive GAN-powered multi-objective optimization algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed HFSL enables various trade-offs between training time and energy consumption, and the solutions of HFSL strictly dominate the solution of FL. Moreover, the Pareto front found by the proposed multi-objective algorithm outperforms other methods, e.g., GMOEA, and NSGA-III.</p>
