<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is designed to preserve data privacy during model training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak private information about the local training data, and they can also be maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our experiments show the efficacy of our framework and demonstrate its ability to improve system robustness against Byzantine attacks while achieving a strong privacy guarantee.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, vast volumes of data are continuously generated and collected by myriad devices embedded in our everyday environments. In conventional centralized machine learning (ML) systems, data from various users (or their edge devices) are gathered and processed on a central server for model training, which raises significant concerns about data privacy. Federated learning (FL), a novel distributed ML paradigm, presents an appealing solution to protect users’ privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In FL, edge devices collaboratively learn a shared ML model while keeping their data locally, thereby mitigating privacy leakage and reducing the need for data transmission. The enhanced privacy and efficiency offered by FL have prompted its application in various data-sensitive IoT scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, including communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, business <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, vanilla FL has been demonstrated to be susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, with <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Byzantine attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy inference attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> standing out as two of the most prevalent. In Byzantine attacks, a number of devices (or clients) participating in FL can act maliciously and disrupt the training of the shared ML model. In a typical training round of FL, devices download the shared global model maintained by a central server and update it locally using their own data, after which the server collects and aggregates these local model updates to obtain the global model update. This process, however, exposes a vulnerability to malicious devices. Such devices can subtly manipulate their local model updates to prevent or mislead the convergence of the shared global model. Notably, it has been shown that even a single malicious device can alter the trained global model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In the privacy inference attack, both devices and the server involved in FL can infer information about the local data of the devices by observing these model updates, thereby posing a privacy risk. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> shows that the malicious server and device can infer whether a particular individual data record was included in the training dataset with high accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Current countermeasures for Byzantine attacks and privacy inference attacks in FL mainly focus on two distinct directions: 1) improving the robustness of the global model against malicious model updates and 2) providing privacy protection for each device’s local dataset. To provide Byzantine robustness, existing works emphasize designing Byzantine-robust aggregators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to filter out or moderate suspicious local updates uploaded by Byzantine devices at the central server. For privacy protection, the differential privacy (DP) mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is a common practice that adds calibrated noise to the model updates before sharing, achieving a rigorous privacy guarantee for each device in FL. Besides, a few works attempt to orchestrate Byzantine robustness and privacy; however, they typically struggle to excel in both aspects simultaneously or operate under the assumption of a trusted central server. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> demonstrates that incorporating “weak” differential privacy can mitigate poisoning attacks in distributed systems and enhance model robustness. However, the applied differential privacy noise in their work is deemed “weak” and does not provide a meaningful privacy guarantee. Flame <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> is a state-of-the-art defense method against poisoning attacks. It utilizes clustering and adaptive clipping strategies, combined with client-level differential privacy, to enhance system robustness. However, it falls short of achieving a balance between privacy and robustness. Secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is co-designed with Byzantine robustness aggregators, but secure aggregation assumes the server is trusted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, our objective is to design a federated learning system that is both Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving. We assume that both the clients and the server are semi-honest. Specifically, the central server and clients are ”honest-but-curious,” which means they honestly follow the training protocol but may be curious about the private local datasets; and a fraction of clients (less than 50%) are also malicious/Byzantine, who do not honestly follow the local model training protocol and can generate arbitrary malicious local updates. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we explore the potential advantages of using the DP mechanism for Byzantine robustness, particularly when a strong privacy guarantee is required. We target the cross-device FL system with client-level DP and aim to improve its robustness against Byzantine attacks without violating its privacy guarantee. The main challenge here is the high variance of the aggregated model update introduced by local stochastic gradients of benign clients, Byzantine attackers, and DP noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address this challenge, we introduce a novel FL scheme that combines sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction techniques with the client-level DP mechanism. We first reduce the variance of the local stochastic gradient training process using local momentum, which is proved to be essential for improving the robustness. Then, we integrate top-<math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> model sparsification into the commonly used client-level DP mechanism without violating its privacy guarantee. This integration allows us to reduce the impact of Byzantine and DP perturbations on the aggregated model update. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, our method demonstrates remarkable performance in terms of both robustness and privacy. Particularly, our approach surpasses existing Byzantine-robust aggregators, showcasing its superiority. When applied to the Fashion-MNIST dataset with 20% Byzantine clients, our approach achieves an impressive testing accuracy improvement of up to +67.34%, while ensuring that the privacy loss of each client is bounded by 1.01 after the training. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</p>

This result indicates that while adding DP noise protects privacy, it also causes a noticeable rise in system error.

From this point onwards, DPFed outperforms FedAvg up to a PBC of 25%, beyond which both FedAvg and DPFed completely diverge. Although DPFed provides robustness against the Byzantine attack when the PBC is small, its performance decreases quickly as the PBC increases.

The dataset consists of 37784 data samples from 715 clients, each representing a speaking role with at least two lines. We use a recurrent neural network (RNN) model for this dataset, which takes a sequence of characters as input and employs an embedding layer to transform each character into an 8-dimensional feature representation. These embedded characters are then processed through two LSTM layers, each consisting of 256 nodes. Finally, a densely connected softmax output layer is applied. We adopt a vocabulary size of 90 in our experiments. Our model is trained to predict a sequence of 80 characters by taking in a sequence of 80 characters, where the input sequence is shifted by one position. Consequently, the model has an output dimension of 80 × 90, totaling around 0.8 million parameters.</p>

We implement two Byzantine attacks, namely the Fang attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and the AGR attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Fang attack is an aggregator-known attack method that requires the knowledge of the server’s aggregator. On the other hand, the AGR attack provides a general framework for Byzantine attacks, making it applicable to optimize attacks for any given aggregation rule, regardless of whether full knowledge or partial knowledge is available. Both attack methods formulate the attack as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the deviation of the global model update in the opposite direction of the benign updates. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we consider the most powerful versions of the attacks based on the principles of the Cannikin Law (or Wooden Bucket Theory). For instance, we utilize the Fang attack specifically designed for Krum to evaluate the Krum and Bulyan defense methods, and we use the AGR attack designed specifically for Median to evaluate the performance of Median. In short, we always select the Fang/AGR attack with the best-attacking performance to evaluate the robustness of these defending methods.</p>

We first evaluate the effectiveness of our method in defending against the Fang attack and AGR attack, aiming to demonstrate its superiority over existing defense approaches. Table <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Experimental Results ‣ V EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION ‣ Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Variance Reduction and Differential Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a> presents the test accuracy results obtained when subjecting our method to a Byzantine attack on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We consider a powerful attack setting where 20% of the clients in the FL system are Byzantine. We also note the experiment’s runtime (i.e., the duration) and report averaged results from 5 trials.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the results, we can observe that among the defense baselines, only the Bulyan shows some resistance to the Fang attack, potentially benefiting from its multi-iteration model cleaning approach. However, Bulyan is limited to scenarios with less than 25% compromised clients, and it will become ineffective beyond that threshold. Regarding the AGR attack, the Trimmed Mean, Median, and SparseFed methods exhibit behavior similar to that of a random classifier, with an accuracy of around 10%. In comparison, our method outperforms Bulyan and Krum by +15.43% and +10.81%, respectively. In terms of running time, our method demonstrates an average increase of 6.6 and 5.4 minutes per round compared to the No Defense setting and SparseFed, respectively. These results highlight the advantages of our approach over Bulyan, which requires significantly longer times of 69.9 and 68.7 minutes.</p>

When facing AGR attack, our method achieves comparable results to Bulyan, with only a slight difference of 0.1% in test accuracy. It is worth noting, however, that the total training duration of Bulyan is approximately three times longer than our approach. Furthermore, our method prioritizes privacy preservation, whereas Bulyan does not offer any privacy guarantee. As a result, Bulyan may not be suitable if system efficiency and client privacy are important considerations.</p>

However, it lacks resilience against Byzantine attacks when a significant number of clients exhibit malicious behavior, resulting in outputs that are nearly random. On the other hand, Flame demonstrates robustness against Byzantine attacks only when the level of differential privacy noise is trivial. It becomes vulnerable to compromise when the magnitude of the noise is substantial, leading to a failure to provide a satisfactory privacy guarantee. In contrast, our method excels in achieving excellent performance in both privacy protection and Byzantine robustness across both the image classification and word generation tasks.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">The byzantine-robust aggregators have garnered considerable attention in recent years as an effective defense mechanism against various distributed attacks in federated learning systems.

The method proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposes utilizing the mean values of each model coordinate on trimmed model candidates, demonstrating stable performance in the face of overwhelming Byzantine attacks.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents FedVRDP, a novel FL scheme that combines sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction techniques with the client-level DP mechanism. FedVRDP is designed to defend against both Byzantine attacks and privacy inference attacks. The scheme maintains the privacy guarantee of state-of-the-art FL with client-level DP scheme while enhancing robustness against Byzantine clients. Thus, FedVRDP achieves Byzantine-robustness and rigorous privacy protection simultaneously.
