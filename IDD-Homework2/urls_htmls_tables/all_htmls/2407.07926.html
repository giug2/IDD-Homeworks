<p id="7.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data has been considered a better privacy-preserving alternative to traditionally sanitized data across various applications. However, a recent article challenges this notion, stating that synthetic data does not provide a better trade-off between privacy and utility than traditional anonymization techniques, and that it leads to unpredictable utility loss and highly unpredictable privacy gain. The article also claims to have identified a breach in the differential privacy guarantees provided by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. When a study claims to refute or invalidate prior findings, it is crucial to verify and validate the study. In our work, we analyzed the implementation of the privacy game described in the article and found that it operated in a highly specialized and constrained environment, which limits the applicability of its findings to general cases. Our exploration also revealed that the game did not satisfy a crucial precondition concerning data distributions, which contributed to the perceived violation of the differential privacy guarantees offered by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. We also conducted a privacy-utility trade-off analysis in a more general and unconstrained environment. Our experimentation demonstrated that synthetic data achieves a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off compared to the provided implementation of <span id="7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization, thereby reaffirming earlier conclusions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the importance of data in various fields has increased exponentially. For various data analytics and machine learning applications, a thorough analysis and a robust model training require a large amounts of high-quality data which provides a diverse and comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios. In many cases, obtaining such data can be difficult or even impossible due to cost limitations, privacy concerns, or simply the lack of available data. Regulatory laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and the the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA often restrict the sharing and publishing of certain privacy-sensitive data in their original form. Restrictions like these led to the research area of privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">fung2010privacy </a></cite>. Over the decades, many data-sharing models have been proposed and practised. From the early statistical disclosure control to the more recent development of differential privacy, the goal of various privacy-preserving data publishing models is to provide practical utility while protecting individuals’ privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">nist2023deid </a></cite>. A well-implemented PPDP technique is supposed to significantly reduce the risk of re-identification (where data is abused to identify individuals who contributed to that dataset). However, it is challenging to achieve complete anonymity while maintaining the usefulness of data. Additionally, as technology evolves, so do methods for de-identification and re-identification, highlighting the need for ongoing research and best practices in data privacy.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent breakthroughs in machine learning techniques such as the generative adversarial networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">goodfellow2020generative </a></cite> and variational auto-encoders (VAEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">kingma2013auto </a></cite> have reignited the interest in synthetic data generation. Synthetic data generation (SDG) is now considered to be of significant potential in both data augmentation and privacy preservation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">jordon2022synthetic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">cai2022GANs </a></cite>.
SDG involves creating an artificial dataset that captures the statistical properties of the original data while ensuring that the actual records remain undisclosed. Synthetic data, by design, does not directly expose sensitive information, making it a compelling solution for privacy preservation. As a potential solution to data sharing limitations, it has garnered significant attention from academia and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">hernandez2022synthetic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">elemam2020practical </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcclure2012differential </a>; <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022synth </a></cite>. SDG has been examined and assessed as a potential contender for high-quality privacy-preserving data publishing in multiple studies.
For example, El Emam et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">elemam2020eval </a></cite> introduced and applied a methodology to assess identity disclosure risks in fully synthetic data using a COVID-19 cases database from Canada, concluding that SDG substantially mitigates the risks of revealing meaningful identities. Zhang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2021privsyn </a></cite> developed a differentially private tabular synthetic data generation technique that captures the correlations and can handle 100 attributes with a large domain size <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(&gt;2^{500})" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"></mi><mo id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><msup id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">2</mn><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">500</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"><gt id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"></gt><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">absent</csymbol><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2">2</cn><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3">500</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">(&gt;2^{500})</annotation></semantics></math>.

</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, a recent paper presented at USENIX-2022 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">stadler2022synthetic </a></cite> (henceforth referred to as ‘SDR’, named after the accompanying code repository <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">ground2021git </a></cite>) claimed that “<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synthetic data either does not prevent inference attacks or does not retain data utility</span>”, “<span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synthetic data does not provide a better trade-off between privacy and utility than traditional anonymization techniques</span>”, and synthetic data causes <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“unpredictable”</span> utility loss and <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“highly unpredictable”</span> privacy gain. In their article, the authors introduced a new membership-privacy game and conducted a comparative analysis focusing on the privacy-utility trade-off between a custom <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization approach versus synthetic dataset generation (based on the real data) leading to those contradicting conclusions. They also claimed to have found a violation of the differential privacy guarantee in the implementation of PATE-GAN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">jordon2018pate </a></cite> and PrivBayes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2017privbayes </a></cite>. If these findings are valid, it means that much of the effort invested in leveraging synthetic data for privacy protection is in vain, as it may be just as effective to release the original data after applying simple <span id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymity and outlier capping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contributions.</span> The trade-off between data utility and privacy remains a key consideration when adopting the synthetic data publishing approach. While synthetic data provides a layer of data protection, it is essential to evaluate its utility in specific analysis or machine learning tasks to ensure that meaningful insights are still attainable. In this evolving data privacy and utility landscape, striking the right balance has become imperative for responsible and effective data management. As it is a relatively new domain, researchers are continuously introducing newer privacy and utility metrics. It is important that whenever new metrics or methods are introduced, the research community investigates and validates their correctness and effectiveness. This is especially important if the newly introduced metrics and methods claim to refute or invalidate prior findings and claims. In this regard, our contributions are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Firstly</span>, we thoroughly investigated the novel privacy metric and the utility measurement approach introduced in SDR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">stadler2022synthetic </a></cite>. We identified several important privacy and utility measurement characteristics of their experimentation that limited the scope and applicability of their results. In particular, the experimental setup of the privacy game in SDR is very unique. When creating member and non-member seed datasets for the membership privacy game in their experiment, the member and non-member datasets came from two distinctly different distribution. Moreover, while testing the performance of the membership attacker, the test datasets representing the ’non-member’ cases were devoid of any non-member outliers. Consequently, generalizing any privacy and utility conclusions from this experimental setting should be done with proper reservation. We demonstrated that when the existence of representative non-member outliers are considered, the attacker’s success of the specific outlier-focused membership-inference game drops significantly, giving the target much room for deniability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Secondly,</span> SDR’s new privacy game claimed to find a violation of the “differential privacy guarantee” provided by PATE-GAN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">jordon2018pate </a></cite> and PrivBayes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2017privbayes </a></cite>. SDR was uncertain about the cause of this violation and speculated that it may stem from the implementation aspects of PATE-GAN and PrivBayes. We found the cause. The execution of SDR’s privacy game does not satisfy a crucial precondition (Yeom et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">yeom2018privacy </a></cite>), resulting in the supposed violation of the privacy guarantee promised by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. We have provided the evidence of this violation in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Overview of SDR ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Finally</span>, we performed a new privacy and utility evaluation of synthetic data under a general environment so that the findings are generally applicable. We ensured that the competing anonymization techniques are operating under the same environment. Using the same dataset (the Texas healthcare dataset), we evaluated the trade-off between utility and privacy using existing statistical metrics, machine learning applications, and MIA attacks. Our results show the privacy-utility trade-off across different levels of privacy and utility requirements in the context of synthetic data creation and SDR’s custom <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization approach. In this evaluation, both the privacy and utility aspect showed a generally predictable trend.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, although <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trade-off</span> is mentioned in previous studies, any figure for visualizing the privacy-utility trade-off for different levels of protection offered by various configurations of anonymization was missing. For example, in SDR, the utility and the privacy of <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization were measured for only one value of <span id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> (i.e., <span id="S1.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>=10), leaving the comparison incomplete (e.g., is there a <span id="S1.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> where a competing method performs better/worse?). We have included a visual reporting template which depicts the quantitative interpretations of the privacy-utility trade-off simultaneously, which can aid the data publishers in selecting the proper sanitization technique at the desired privacy level (Section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="6.3 Trade-off Visualization ‣ 6 Results ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.3</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is typically generated to replicate the characteristics and patterns of real data. Unlike traditional anonymization, there is no one-to-one relationship between real and synthetic data. Synthetic data generation is not a new concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">rubin1993statistical </a></cite>; however, it has gained renewed interest in the post deep learning era. Various methods are available for creating synthetic data, which can be broadly classified into two groups: statistical methods and deep learning-based methods. Statistical techniques aim to replicate the statistical properties and relationships found in actual datasets (e.g., Bayesian networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">young2009using </a></cite>, Hidden Markov models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">ngoko2014synthetic </a></cite>). On the other hand, deep learning models acquire the ability to determine the relevant attributes through a stochastic training process (e.g., GANs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">goodfellow2020generative </a></cite>, VAEs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">kingma2013auto </a></cite>).</p>

The goal is to reveal the actual identity of specific individuals. Another attack named linkage attack is closely related to the re-identification attack.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main objective of data publishing is to share information while safeguarding individuals’ privacy. Therefore, before releasing data, it is crucial to evaluate the utility of these datasets. Failing to check the utility aspect after ensuring privacy can be very problematic and even life-threatening (e.g., warfarin dosing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">fredrikson2014warfarin </a></cite>). Various utility metrics have been developed to assess the utility of the processed data. In a broader categorization, these metrics can be divided into two ways: special purpose metrics and general purpose metrics.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Special purpose metrics:</span>
A special-purpose utility metric measures the utility or usefulness of released data for a particular, often narrowly-defined, purpose or application. These metrics are designed to assess how well the data serves a particular use case or meets the requirements of a specific user or system. For example, in healthcare data publishing, a special-purpose utility metric might focus on how well the data supports a particular predictive modeling task. If the data is intended to be used in a machine learning model, usually ”train on synthetic/anonymized, test on real” is a commonly practiced approach to measure the utility of the synthetic/anonymized data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">hernandez2022synthetic </a></cite>. In this case, usually metrics such as the classification/prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, the area under the curve (AUC), etc. are used to quantify the utility of synthetic/anonymized data. Sometimes, the researchers also try to modify or adapt an anonymized or synthetic technique focusing on a particular task that needs to be accomplished using the published data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">lefevre2008workload </a>; <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">fung2007anonymizing </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">General purpose metrics:</span>
When data publishers lack knowledge about the specific use cases for the published data, they employ general-purpose metrics to evaluate the similarities and data distribution between the original and sanitized datasets. These metrics vary from simple statistics such as the range, mean, median, standard deviation, to more involved tests such as the Pearson’s correlation test, Chi-squared test, to corresponding variable’s distribution tests such as the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, total variation distance (TVD) and many more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">hernandez2022synthetic </a></cite>. There is not any one metric that captures all the aspect of resemblance to the raw data.

<div id="S3.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">An example execution of the game is as follows. At first, the target outliers are removed from the raw dataset, and then 10K records are randomly selected as the reference dataset. Then, 10 datasets of 1K records for 10 synthetic data generators are randomly sampled from the 10K records. Then, 10 synthetic data generators are trained using one sample dataset (i.e., 1K records) for one generator each. Then, each generator is sampled 10 times (each time for 1K records); that is, 10 generators produce 100 synthetic datasets in total. These 100 datasets are the ‘non-member’ cases.</p>

The subsequent steps are similar to the non-member case. Finally, 10 generators produce 100 synthetic datasets in total. These 100 datasets are the ‘member’ cases (because the outlier was a part of their generation). Lastly, features were extracted from these 100 Member and 100 non-Member datasets. Then, the features and the corresponding membership labels are used to train the membership classifier (e.g., a Random Forest classifier).</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the factors that limited the scope in the novel privacy game in SDR. We demonstrate how changing different aspects of the privacy experiment influence the privacy state of the target record. In Subsection <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Accounting for Non-member Outliers ‣ 4 Reassessment of SDR ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, we showed that the privacy experiment in SDR did not consider the cases for population representative outlier in the ’non-member’ labeled sets even though the raw dataset contained them. We discuss the theoretical necessity as well as the experimental evidence of this issue in detail. Subsection <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Limitation of the Test Dataset ‣ 4 Reassessment of SDR ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a> discusses how a limitation in the test dataset can inflate the attacker’s success. It also experimentally shows how the SDR’s current attacker faces difficulty inferring non-membership of the target record when a non-member outlier is present in the test dataset.

Instead, it is contingent upon the corresponding equivalence class size within the entire population. To illustrate, consider a scenario in which 1,000 records are randomly drawn from a pool of 50,000 records and subjected to ‘<span id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>=5’ anonymization, resulting in three equivalence classes of sizes 5, 495, and 500. At first glance, a record that matches the quasi-identifiers of the ‘5-member’ equivalence class appears to have a risk of re-identification of 1/5, or 0.2. However, if, within the entire population of 50,000, there are 100 such records matching the quasi-identifiers of those 5 records, the actual risk diminishes to 1/100, i.e., 0.01. In essence, a target record’s real risk or vulnerability is contingent upon the number of records with quasi-identifiers matching those of the target record within the entire population. Similarly, if there are outliers in a published dataset, the actual risk associated with these outliers depends on the total number of similar outliers within the population.</p>

<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although re-identification attack and membership inference attack are different in nature (see Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Privacy Metrics ‣ 2 Background ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>), a similar principle applies. The plausible deniability in the case of a membership inference attack is directly related to the false-positive calls made by an attacker (Attacker’s Advantage = True Positive Rate - False Positive Rate). Note that, like in the re-identification attack’s case, the risk or an attacker’s advantage could be overestimated if the privacy-providing cloaking records in the representative sample/population are ignored and the attacker’s evaluation dataset only consists of trivial cases.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Empirical Evidence from SDR.</span> The first limitation in SDR’s privacy game experiment is that it did not consider the cases where non-member outliers exist in the population. SDR employed random subsampling of very small sizes (e.g., from 50K to 10K, and finally to 1K). This subsampling resulted in the sampled subsets containing no outliers. The ‘member’ labeled sets are created by forcefully inserting the target outlier to the sampled subsets. On the other hand, the ‘non-member’ labeled sets contained no outliers. This is comparable to an environment where the entire raw population includes only a single outlier—the target outlier. Consequently, the membership classifier effectively becomes a data distribution differentiator. That is the reason why features as simple as the histograms or summary statistics (mean, median and so on) were able to get such good attack success. In the ’member’ case, the outlier influences the synthetic data generation, causing larger values in the outlier attribute fields. On the other hand, since the non-member cases did not include representative non-member outliers, these synthetic datasets have comparatively lower values in the corresponding attribute fields.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We now describe the evidence we found that reveal this limitation.

Unfortunately, the random sampling of the 1K records from the sample of 10K records (that were random-sampled from 50K records) didn’t pick any outlier as evident from the mean of those columns of the ‘raw’ datasets in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4 Reassessment of SDR ‣ Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (sourced from Fig. 9 of SDR for the reader’s convenience).

The fact that the attacker’s advantage is inflated on the Texas Hospital Discharge dataset would have been detected if the ’non-member’ test datasets had contained non-member outliers. Unfortunately, the evaluation phase utilized the same subsampling approach as before. Consequently, the same issue associated with the small sampling size resulted in the test datasets devoid of non-member outliers (the outliers that provide the privacy cloak to the target).

The 150 non-member datasets are similarly generated using 15 generators, but a non-member outlier was inserted instead of the target outlier.) It should be noted that this modified evaluation phase, in which a non-member outlier was inserted into the test datasets, also fails to address the representativeness issue of the population distribution highlighted in Section 3.1. However, our goal in this section is to demonstrate and expose the inflation of the attacker’s success in SDR’s approach where non-member outliers are not considered. This modification employs the same sampling and outlier insertion approach from SDR to the non-member cases of the ’test dataset’ (SDR only applied outlier insertion to the train dataset’s ’member’ cases).</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In subsection 5.1 of SDR, the authors observed that two out of the five outliers achieved a privacy gain (PG) of less than 0.1 in the membership inference attacks. This observation raised concerns as it contradicted the theoretical lower bound offered by differential privacy, as proven by Yeom et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">yeom2018privacy </a></cite>. In light of this contradiction, the authors claimed about PATEGAN and PrivBayes that <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“while both models on paper fulfill their formal privacy definitions, their available implementations did not.”</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Upon further analysis, SDR found that the random sampling process was not effectively selecting targets with rare categorical attributes or substantial outliers in numerical attributes. This inadequacy led to the creation of two distinct types of datasets: the ‘non-member’ datasets exhibited fewer categories (e.g., the <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">‘INVALID’</span> category in the <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">TypeOfAdmission</span> column) and a narrower range in the outlier column, while the ‘member’ datasets featured additional categories (e.g., the <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">‘INVALID’</span> category in the <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">TypeOfAdmission</span> column) and broader numerical ranges because their seed dataset had the forcefully inserted outlier. In an effort to address this issue, SDR modified the implementations of PATEGAN and PrivBayes by explicitly specifying the ranges of numerical attributes and the categories for categorical attributes. Although this adjustment improved the privacy gain considerably, the bound was still violated. The authors stated that <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“the remaining gap can likely be explained either by other aspects of the model’s implementation that violate theoretical assumptions and we were not able to find in our analysis”</span>.</p>

The question is: are the different distributions responsible for the observed violation of the differential privacy guarantee in SDR? As we look deeper into the concerned bound on the attacker’s advantage established by Yeom et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">yeom2018privacy </a></cite>, we noticed a violation of an important precondition related to differential privacy. The violated precondition is that the two datasets , which differ by one record, were supposed to have <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“<span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">identical distributions</span>”</span> <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(Yeom et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">yeom2018privacy </a></cite> (page-6): Proof of theorem 1: Bounds from differential privacy)</span>. We have demonstrated with empirical evidence in the previous subsection that this condition was violated in the implementation of the privacy game. We found that even when the two datasets differed by just one record, they represented two completely different distributions, including ranges, means, standard deviations, and peaks. This violation went unnoticed. SDR attempted to resolve this issue by specifying upfront the ranges of numerical attributes and possible values of categorical attributes. However, this solution only partially solved the problem because, although the range was externally fixed, the records inside the dataset did not represent the actual distribution. As a result, it compromised the game’s applicability to real-world scenarios.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">If preprocessing steps vary between competing methods, it becomes challenging to isolate the effects of the anonymization technique itself on the results.

<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SDR claims to implement the sanitization procedure described by the National Health Service (NHS) England <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">NHS2019synth </a></cite>. The NHS provided a methodology to create synthetic data and provided an example by creating a synthetic dataset using a Bayesian Network. In that NHS methodology, before using the Bayesian Network, the raw data is pre-processed by replacing geographical data with average demographic data, categorizing highly detailed variables into bands, eliminating specific time details, filtering out infrequent values, capping integer variables, and removing unique values and subsets. In SDR, before performing <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization, the preprocessing steps were performed on the raw data, including capping all the values above 95% quantile to 95% quantile. However, when generating synthetic data, those preprocessing steps were not performed on the seed raw data, not even when generating synthetic data using a Bayesian Network (despite the NHS report providing a demonstration using a Bayesian Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">NHS2019synth </a></cite>). We believe that the preprocessing of the raw dataset for one approach (i.e., <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k-</span>anonymization) while leaving the dataset unprocessed in the competing approach (against the advise by the NHS) does not make a fair comparative study. For example, the outliers in the seed datasets were kept intact in the synthetic data generation process but were capped when using the <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization. This caused an adverse effect in the privacy and utility aspect of the synthetic data. For example, the deviation of the means and medians from the real dataset was used as an utility metric in SDR. Note that the real population was 50K and but the sampled dataset is only (1K + the target outlier). Consequently, the outlier’s impact on the mean is even more pronounced in the synthetic dataset. This is unfair because the outlier will clearly affect the mean in the synthetic data generation process, but due to capping it will have little to no impact in the <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymized dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The impact of not capping is more pronounced in the differentially private data generators. As the DP synthetic data generators rely on adding noise to protect the records, having an outlier amidst the records will generate many records between the usual higher end and the outlier value. Adding so many records between the outlier’s value and the usual upper-end destroys the distribution of that variable.</p>

For example, Mayer et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">mayer2020privacy </a></cite> leveraged an autoencoder neural network for detecting outliers and novel data points. This neural network comprises an encoder network responsible for reducing input data dimensions and a decoder network focused on reconstructing the input data. Although dimensionality reduction leads to information loss, the learning objective encourages the preservation of common information among most training samples. This approach enables the identification of outliers containing rare information by assessing the model’s loss. To determine whether a given data sample is an outlier using autoencoders, any sample exhibiting a loss exceeding a learned threshold is considered an outlier or novelty. The authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">mayer2020privacy </a></cite> noted that while anomaly detection is inherently challenging, synthetic data demonstrated comparable effectiveness to models trained on the original data in specific scenarios.

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we explain how we measured privacy for both the anonymized and the synthetic datasets using a membership inference attack. We used the TensorFlow Privacy library’s membership inference attack (released by a team from Google Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">tf2020tfmia </a></cite>). TensorFlow-privacy library is widely used by researchers (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">tang2022mitigating </a>; <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">song2021systematic </a></cite>). Its MIA attack is inspired by the original attack proposed by Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">shokri2017membership </a></cite> but has a slightly different approach. The attack does not involve training multiple shadow models as described in the original attack. Instead, it leverages the findings from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">salem2018ml </a></cite>, which indicate that one shadow model could be adequate. The Tensorflow-library’s MIA attack uses the original model’s predictions on the target data points to determine their susceptibility to membership inference. This library launches the MIA attack from the perspective of the owner of a (victim) model, who wants to assess the model’s MIA privacy state. To capture the worst-case leakage, a shadow model needed to behave the same as the target model. The TensorFlow-privacy library’s MIA attack does this exact replication of behavior by making disjoint subsets of the victim model’s labeled prediction vectors and uses these disjoint subsets to act as both the shadow dataset and the target dataset (but not simultaneously, i.e., when one subset acts as the shadow dataset, another subset acts as the target dataset). This approach eliminates the need to train shadow models that approximate the original model’s behavior, making the attack more efficient. Essentially, the original model being targeted acts as its own shadow model, perfectly approximating its behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, while the owner of the victim model provides the attack model with the member and non-member prediction vectors from the victim model, the attack model is not tested on its own training vectors. Internally, this MIA attack uses StratifiedKFold for this purpose (cross-validation folds = 2 by default). In the default settings, in each fold, the attack model trains on half of the member and non-member prediction vectors from the victim model; and in the testing phase, the other half of the member and non-member prediction vectors are used. Across two folds, all records receive their membership assignment once, allowing the owner to obtain the attacker’s score.

Using these folds, the owner then trains the attack models, i.e., the membership inference classifiers. Finally, the trained MIA attackers are tested using the other folds (i.e., excludes the training fold) and the attacker’s membership predictions are compared against the ground-truth labels.</p>

The left bar graph shows the aggregate statistical score for resemblance. The observed trend is consistent. As the number of bin increases, distributions of the columns in the synthetic data either get better, becoming more and more akin to the raw data, or at least remain at the same level. The aggregate score for BayNet with bin=2 is 92%, which reaches 97% when bin is increased to 5. In the case of the <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymized dataset, the trend is similar with the increase of <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> as <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> increases. For example, with <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> set to 5, the score is 97%, but when <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> is increased to 20, the score drops to 90%.
The right bar-graph displays the machine learning utility of the datasets using the classification accuracy score. For synthetic data generated using BayNet, the classification score remains consistent at 72%. However, the score decreases significantly with the increasing values of <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>. For <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> = 5, the classification score is relatively high at 68%. As the value of <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> increases, classification accuracy decreases. For <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> = 20, the classification accuracy dropped to 64%, which is close to the majority class classification score. This decline can be attributed to the suppression-based nature of the NHS-sanitization, which reduces the number of records in the anonymized dataset as <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span> increases.</p>

The trend in advantage is consistent for both the value of bin and <span id="S6.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>.

Moreover, for NHS-sanitization, SDR’s privacy game was unable to detect the membership of any outlier up to a precision of 0.8. When we lowered the attacker’s precision bar further to 0.6, it was able to detect some of the outliers. Note that an attacker’s precision of 0.6 or 0.8 is not a powerful attack, as it gives much reason for deniability.</p>

We now present a better way to depict the privacy-utility trade-off of different algorithms on a single graph.

This visualization approach simplifies the problem of finding which method performs better in terms of both privacy and utility.

<span id="S7.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Non-Uniform Distribution:</span> If the population is not uniformly distributed, small samples are less likely to capture the variability within the population.

<span id="S7.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Lack of Coverage:</span> Small samples might miss important subgroups within the population.

Rather, our objective was to demonstrate that if we consider the forceful insertion of an outlier as a member in the dataset as acceptable, then a similar insertion of non-member outliers causes the attacker to produce significantly more false positives, increasing the target’s deniability. Since this particular attacker was trained with datasets related to the forcefully inserted outlier (a special environment), it is logical to evaluate its capabilities against a similarly forcefully inserted outlier. We acknowledge that this setting is not a very realistic environment; however, it highlights one specific limitation of the SDR’s attacker.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Until recently, synthetic data was considered to offer better privacy-utility trade-offs compared to traditional anonymization techniques. However, a recent article has contradicted the longstanding position that synthetic data is better than traditionally sanitized data for preserving utility while maintaining privacy. In this article, we examined the implementation of the novel privacy game and identified critical characteristics that were limiting the scope of their findings. We also provided general but comprehensive recommendations to avoid potential pitfalls in future research endeavors. Then, we experimented with synthetic data and <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization, evaluating their performance. To make our evaluation fair among the competing techniques, the input dataset samples received the same preprocessing treatment. We compared the privacy-utility trade-off using established statistical metrics and membership inference attacks. We incorporated a visual reporting template for illustrating the quantitative interpretations of the privacy-utility trade-off. This visualization method offers a more informative view and helps the data publishers select the data publishing techniques that align with their desired level of trade-off. Our findings showed a generally predictable trend in the trade-off dynamics across different privacy and utility requirements levels. We also found the synthetic dataset approach superior to the <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span>-anonymization approach.</p>

<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Future work.</span> In this study, we did not explore the broader question of whether synthetic data generation is better than <span id="S8.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> traditional anonymization techniques because it involves a much bigger scope. Traditional anonymization methods encompass a variety of techniques and extend beyond simple data suppression. These techniques incorporate a range of generalization-based algorithms, such as the Datafly, Mondrian, and Incognito, to name a few. We also limited our analysis to basic statistical utility metrics even though there are more utility metrics that consider different aspects of the data. Some of these metrics do not work well with generalized anonymized data. Furthermore, there are many variations of membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">tang2022mitigating </a></cite> and also other attacks beyond membership inference attacks. In the future, we aim to conduct a more comprehensive study that covers prominent anonymization algorithms, a wider range of utility metrics, and various privacy attacks to thoroughly examine whether synthetic data generation is more effective than all traditional anonymization techniques.</p>
