<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en">The massive use of digital documents due to the substantial trend of paperless initiatives confronted some companies to find ways to process thousands of documents per day automatically. To achieve this, they use automatic information retrieval (IR) allowing them to extract useful information from large datasets quickly.
In order to have effective IR methods, it is first necessary to have an adequate dataset. Although companies have enough data to take into account their needs, there is also a need a public database to compare contributions between state-of-the-art methods.
Public data on the document exists as DocVQA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">DocVQA </a></cite> and XFUND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu-etal-2022-xfund </a></cite>, but these do not fully satisfy the needs of companies. XFUND contains only form documents while the company uses several types of documents (i.e structured documents like forms but also semi-structured as invoices, and unstructured as emails). Compared to XFUND, DocVQA has several types of documents but only 4.5% of them are corporate documents (i.e invoice, purchase order, etc). All of these 4.5% of documents do not meet the diversity of documents required by the company.
We propose CHIC a visual question-answering public dataset. This dataset contains different types of corporate documents and the information extracted from these documents meet the right expectations of companies.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Private companies are faced with a huge amount of documents to process every day. These documents come from various sources (e.g internal company processes, subcontractors’ documents, and administration documents). Processing such a large amount of documents requires a lot of effort and manpower if an automatic system is not used.
This is where some companies such as YOOZ, Esker, and others are involved to provide automatic document processing solutions. These solutions use Information retrieval (IR) to allow the classification and extraction of useful information from documents in large databases. This permits companies to save both time and money. In order to provide a successful IR solution, it must first be verified that it meets the constraints of the industry. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These industrial constraints correspond to real needs and bringing solutions to these constraints will allow efficient solutions for the final users.
Among these constraints, we can cite, for example, constraints linked to the speed of processing a document, which must be less than a few seconds. This allows the end-users to have fast results because if the automatic processing of a document takes a few minutes, doing it manually would take the same time and it would not be efficient.
These IR solutions have to be fast while keeping real efficiency because the quality of the results should not be lost at the expense of saving process time. It is also important to get the most correct results as possible because manually correcting these errors would require more effort and time. IR solutions should provide results when a high level of confidence is reached, else inform the end-user to process this document. Manual annotation of some cases is faster than checking all the extracted information, where the error is, and correcting it. Once all these constraints are met, it is also necessary to have adequate public data to compare the performance of state-of-the-art models with each other and to have metrics on whether these constraints are respected. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Public data is very useful for IR methods, as it allows to compare results between different methods, and also to see the limitations of these methods on this type of data. Two aspects characterized this data, the first being the type of documents and the second the elements to be extracted.
The companies that provide IR solutions are specialized in one type of document because processing any type of document and extracting any type of information would require several platforms, several methods, and considerable effort. In this paper, we will focus on corporate documents such as (invoices, purchase orders, etc), we have illustrated these different documents in the figure<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ CHIC: Corporate Document for Visual question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
We can categorize them into three categories. Structured documents (e.g ID, check, form) are characterized by a high degree of inter-similarity in the layout of the documents, as documents of the same type will always have the same layout. The semi-structured documents (such as invoices, and purchase orders) can change the structure from one document to another but respect a particular organization of the elements that compose them. Finally, the unstructured document (like e-mails) do not respect a predefined layout, and that varied greatly between them. In the following, we will refer to the set of documents presented above as corporate documents.
In addition to different types of documents, these companies are confronted with documents in several languages. This multi-language aspect is required because the companies providing IR solutions work with several companies from different countries and therefore of different languages.
We will focus on European languages, such as English, German, Italian, French, and Spanish. The choice of languages corresponds to the vast majority of documents processed by these companies.
The relevant information to be extracted from these documents for the company is various. In order to take into account all types of information to be extracted, we have privileged the Visual Question Answerings (VQA) approach. These approaches have the advantage of extracting a lot of information with questions and are easy to use by end users.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>DocVQA</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DocVQA is the first dataset available for questions and answers on company documents.
DocVQA is a dataset containing 12 767 documents of different types and layouts. These documents include, for example, handwritten documents, forms, advertisements, etc.
To extract information from the document, they annotated 50,000 questions and answers.
This dataset is perfectly adapted to extract any type of information from any type of document.
Despite the significant contribution of DocVQA with the number of questions and answers available and the documents, there are nevertheless limits to its use in an industrial context.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The limitation of Docvqa can be summarised in two points. This first point is that it has very few corporate documents (e.g. invoices, purchase orders, etc.) present in DocVQA. To arrive at this conclusion, we searched for the type of documents that would correspond to our context. We extracted the corporate documents in DocVQA manually, in order to have higher precision and this required us 20 man-hours to finalize this task. We found 586 documents that can be used in the corporate context, we will call this subset DocVQA-Corporate. Although DocVQA-Corporate represents 4.5% of all the documents contained in Docvqa, this is very little. On the other hand, this number is sufficient to constitute a question and answer dataset on corporate documents. However, after analysing the types of documents present in DocVQA-Corporate, we found that they did not satisfy all the requirements necessary to provide a public dataset in the context of corporate documents. The DocVQA-Corporate contains documents with almost the same layout type, so not enough inter-document diversity. We observed that he had approximately 20 different document layouts, which were duplicated several times in DocVQA-Corporate.This observation led us to conclude that DocVQA-Corporate documents are far from being an appropriate dataset for an industrial context, as it does not take into account the need for great diversity that might occur in an incoming flow of corporate documents.
The second point concerns the information extracted in DocVQA-Corporate. When we examine the type of responses retrieved from Docvqa-corporate, we find that this search information is primarily ( 40% of responses) strings. Although strings are included in the information sought by companies, the percentage of this type of response is still less than 20% (i.e when reviewing client information extraction expectations). These string responses in Docvqa-Corporate are of little or no interest to companies (i.e. only 38% of these string responses are useful in our cases).
The rest of the questions correspond well to the expectations of the companies (i.e. we find information on amounts, reference numbers, etc.).
In addition to these two main points, other limitations exist. The first is that DocVQA documents are only in English, whereas in the industrial context often encounter multi-language documents. Secondly, the annotated answers in DocVQA contain only the text and not the precise location of the answer. Being able to locate an answer very precisely allows the algorithms to learn the correct position of an answer and not simply return the first occurrence found. This is necessary because in many cases the answer may be found in several places in the document and the algorithms usually select the first answer found as the correct answer and learn from that (e.g. we may have 10 as the total amount, or 10 on a date or 10 may correspond to another number).
These limitations described above show us that neither DocVQA nor DocVQA-Corporate perfectly meets all the constraints for meeting the need for a public dataset in the industrial context.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>XFUND</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">XFUND is a dataset of contains 1393 document forms (structured documents) containing key-value pairs annotated by humans. In this dataset, key-value means for example, if we have in the document ”date of birth: 13 January 2023”, in this case, the word date of birth will be annotated as a key and linked to the value 13 January 2023. The number of annotated key-value is about 30,000 out of the 1393 documents. These value keys are extracted in several documents in 7 languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Portuguese). Despite the real contribution of XFUND, there are several limitations that prevent us from using it in a corporate documents context 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We can summarise the limitations of XFUND firstly on its document type but also on the key-value information annotated in this document.
The first point concerns the XFUND documents, these documents are all structural documents. These structured documents as their name indicate contain words often organized in the same way (i.e. in value keys). Although the company deals with form documents, it also deals with other types of documents (i.e. as seen in the introduction) semi-structured documents, and non-structured documents. In order to respect the types of documents encountered in their daily flow, it is relevant to have documents with several types of structures. Unfortunately, XFUND does not respect the diversity constraint expected by the end users of a public dataset.
The second point concerns the key-value information extracted in XFUND. In the annotations done in XFUND, either a word is a key, a value or a title and everything else is categorized as Other. Among these words annotated as Other, we find many words that could be of interest to companies (e.g. a form number that is found without a key at the top). Unfortunately, if companies wanted to use XFUND to extract some Other words, they would have to invest time in annotating them.
All these limitations together make the XFUND not a corporate dataset but a dataset of forms for specific needs.</p>

In IR, it is certainly relevant to have in the first documents that reflect the context that interests us but it is also important to extract useful information from these documents.

To be more precise, we have 774 images and text extracted from these images. We extracted the text with the help of Abby FineReader OCR. The image in CHIC have a high resolution of 2560 * 3332 pixels.
CHIC imitates as well as possible the different types of documents that could be found in companies, it contains structured, semi-structured, and non-structured documents.

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To be able to build a document that meets the requirements of the company, we first have to find documents that can correspond to this context.
Unfortunately in the state-of-the-art either we have XFUND datasets containing one category of the document but a multilingual document. We have also RVL-CDIP which contains a wide variety of documents. Finding the right documents requires taking advantage of the best of both types to build our new dataset.
The documents we use are extracted from two public databases RVL-CDIP<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">RVL-CDIP </a></cite> and XFUND<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu-etal-2022-xfund </a></cite>. The advantage of using them will be twofold. The first is that RVL-CDIP will provide us with semi-structured or non-structured documents all with a different layout from each other, unlike DocVQA-Corporate.
The second point is that the documents extracted from XFUND are multi-language forms, unlike RVL-CDIP which contains only English documents. Overall we collected 770 documents containing CHIC 655 from RVL-CDIP and 115 from XFUND. In the following, we will be interested in the information extracted from these documents.

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The protocol for annotating the questions and answers was as follows. First, we annotated the questions, then the answers to these questions, and finally we checked to see whether the responses are as expected. In order to annotate the questions, it is first necessary to know what type of questions the end-users need. For this, we have collected the expectations of the type of information to be extracted and what type of question to be used. The instructions were to diversify the questions, in addition to the standard questions (e.g. what is the net amount, when the word net amount is present in the documents) to add other types of questions. We formulate some questions to require understanding beyond the content of the document, such as ”what is the amount at the top of table I)” or ”what is the number at the top of the document reference”. We also have questions that require arithmetic and comparison operations on elements of the document, such as ”what is the name of the element with the maximum amount in the table?”. These other types of questions target information that could not be extracted with standard questions.
After annotating these questions, we then annotated the answers to these questions. The annotation of these questions was done in a special way, we asked each annotator to annotate questions from other annotators and not his own. This will allow confront the understanding of another person on your questions and from this understanding to extract the necessary information. Once the questions and answers were completed, we asked each annotator to check whether the answer to their question matched their expectations. If the answer did not meet their expectations, we either tried to reformulate the question or find the right answer together. All these annotations could be done by a tool that we have developed ourselves.

We have seen in the sub-section that the documents we have collected come from different databases and that their structures correspond to the expectations of the companies. Corporate documents are different from other types of documents both in their layout and in the words they contain. We have observed that 93% of our documents CHIC contain between 100-400 words and only approximately 30 documents contain more than 500 words. When we compare these statistics with another type of document, for example, scientific documents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">distrubution_words_paper </a></cite>, which contain on average 1500 words per document. This shows that the corporate documents contained in CHIC, the words that compose it despite containing on average 150 words. These are distributed over the whole document and not just organized in word blocks (like newspaper articles, scientific papers, etc). In the following, we will go into detail about these words to see which ones are extracted and what their usefulness is.

The questions in CHIC are mostly related to the date or amount and any other number that concerns the primary needs of the end-users.
These elements are essential in a company because they are the key information in a document. Being able to extract this information brings many benefits. For example to automatically find the invoice with a precise date or precise amount.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on the CHIC dataset, we have taken two types of methods pre-trained and non-pre-trained as a baseline.
The majority of methods can be divided into two categories: methods that pre-train on the data in an unsupervised way in order to acquire as much prior knowledge as possible (i.e. inspired by human learning mechanisms, which, in order to learn new knowledge, always rely on acquired prior knowledge). Other methods do not use this prior knowledge but are very good at exploiting as much of the current data as possible and extracting as much knowledge as possible in order to achieve a good performance.
For the pre-trained methods, we have selected Donut <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Donut </a></cite>, LayoutLMv3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">LayoutLMv3 </a></cite>, and LayoutLMv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">LayoutLMv2 </a></cite>. For the non-pre-trained methods, we selected QALayout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">qalayout </a></cite> and QANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">qanet </a></cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">LayoutLM-based are pre-trained methods like LayoutLMv2<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">LayoutLMv2 </a></cite> or LayoutLMv3<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">LayoutLMv3 </a></cite>. They are proposed by Microsoft to be used in several tasks of document understanding (document classification, question-answer, etc). Their pre-training is based on the textual, image, and layout features (i.e. the positions of the words in the document).
The goal of the pre-training is to hide a specific part of the document and find it within the context. The difference between LayoutLMv2, and LayoutLMv3 is essential in the method of masking and the input features used.
We will first start to explain LayoutLMv2. The inputs to the model are the text extracted from the image, the image features and layout information related to the word’s position in the document. The image features used is a split of the image into 4 parts. Each part will contain only a part of the 1/4 image. The features link to the position of the word in the document and the sequential position is used (i.e. what is the position of the words in compared to the text extracted with OCR). The feature Bounding box of each word corresponds to the position of the words but also the positions of each part of the image. The pre-training objectives of LayoutLMV2 are three Masked Visual-Language Modeling (MVLM), Text-Image Alignment (TIA), and Text-Image Matching (TIM).
LayoutLMv3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">LayoutLMv3 </a></cite> uses pretty much the same features as LayoutLMv2, their difference is image features.
LayoutLMv3 does not split the image into 4 but into a sequence of uniform P × P patches (i.e P is 16 in the pre-trained model). LayoutLMv3 pre-training objective is Masked Visual-Language Modeling (MVLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and Word-Patch Alignment (WPA).</p>

The authors demonstrated the efficiency of both correct answer detection and textual extraction compared to the classical OCR which often makes errors for handwritten words or which is not well visible.
To achieve these results they first learned ”how to read” in the model, and they used millions of documents for this task. They parse the document from top-left to bottom-right, their goal was to minimize the cross-entropy of the next token prediction based on the previous context. After learning how to read, they learned how to understand it. For this, they used tasks like classification, document information extraction, and document visual question answering.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of the models we select some metrics Exact match, Anls, F1 and IOU.
We can separate these metrics into two categories, strict metrics don’t allow any errors in the answer (e.g. the Exact Match score), and soft metrics take errors such as missing a word in the answer, etc., into account. We have chosen these metrics because each of them addresses a specific need, and together they give an overall picture of the performance of the methods.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the table, we mention the baselines tested on CHIC but also on Docvqa. We find first the name of the method used, the number of parameters of this method, and then their execution time on GPU and CPU in seconds (i.e. we have described the type of machine used for these experiments). Finally, we have the metrics of these methods on the CHIC dataset and on DocVQA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">We start our analysis with time performance, and finding the right compromise between execution time and performance is important in an industrial context.
To get this metric we took the average response time provided by each method on both the GPU and CPU of the same machine.
We chose GPU and CPU because in inference it is possible that some companies will operate these methods on CPU.

To extract information the method needs text, they first extract the text with OCR and then uses this text and other features to predict an answer.

The performance in time obtained shows that the fastest method is QANet and the longest is Donut. On the CHIC dataset, the method with the best promise between time performance and the most correct answers is LayoutLMv2.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When we analyze the recurrent errors on CHIC with these methods, we notice that they can be grouped into three main errors. the first concerns errors due to the OCR. These errors can be divided into two, the first is an error due to false extraction because a word is not well read by OCR. Other errors are due to the order of the words extracted by the OCR, this order has a substantial impact on the prediction. For example, if in the document we have a word Date: 12/02/2003, it is possible that sometimes the OCR reads the Date then a word in step etc and the final order is Date F72535 01/01/2004 358 12/02/2003. Finally, it will choose a word that is next to the word date so sometimes it takes the wrong date or just other numbers.
The other type of error is confused with another value because they have the same keyword search next to it, for example, if the question is what is the job number? in some cases because the predicted answer is the first word that the keyword job, it may be job ref AF12321 whereas job no may be a little further down the text.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">All our experiments were carried out on the same machine. This machine contains 4 nvidia rtx A6000 GPUs 48GB and has 256 GB ram and 4 TV of SSD disk. Each experiment was performed on a single GPU. The methods we tested had different parameter sizes and different memory usage capacities. For this aspect we chose a batch size of 32 for the QANet and QALayout methods, then a batch size of 16 for the LayoutLMv3 and LayoutLMv2 methods and finally a batch size of 1 for Donut. To train these methods we used the same Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 at the beginning which decreases as the performance stagnates. We chose a number of epochs 200 and added an early stop 5.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a new public dataset for visual question answering on corporate documents. We have taken all the requirements expected from a corporate dataset to propose this dataset. CHIC contains 774 documents in several languages but also with different layouts (i.e. semi-structured, unstructured and structured document). From these documents we annotated 3384 questions and answers in various languages. These questions are also diverse as we find questions requiring an understanding of numerical value links (e.g. what is the maximum amount in the document?), links between different words in a document (e.g. what is the amount in Table I line 3?) and other questions involving key-value understanding (e.g. what is job number?).
This dataset will allow comparing different models on the visual question answering for corporate documents.</p>
