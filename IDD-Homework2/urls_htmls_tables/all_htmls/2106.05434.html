<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">An integrated clinical environment (ICE) enables the connection and coordination of the internet of medical things around the care of patients in hospitals. However, ransomware attacks and their spread on hospital infrastructures, including ICE, are rising. Often the adversaries are targeting multiple hospitals with the same ransomware attacks. These attacks are detected by using machine learning algorithms. But the challenge is devising the anti-ransomware learning mechanisms and services under the following conditions: (1) provide immunity to other hospitals if one of them got the attack, (2) hospitals are usually distributed over geographical locations, and (3) direct data sharing is avoided due to privacy concerns. In this regard, this paper presents a federated distributed integrated clinical environment, aka. <em id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedDICE</em>. FedDICE integrates federated learning (FL), which is privacy-preserving learning, to SDN-oriented security architecture to enable collaborative learning, detection, and mitigation of ransomware attacks. We demonstrate the importance of FedDICE in a collaborative environment with up to four hospitals and four popular ransomware families, namely WannaCry, Petya, BadRabbit, and PowerGhost. Our results find that in both IID and non-IID data setups, FedDICE achieves the centralized baseline performance that needs direct data sharing for detection. However, as a trade-off to data privacy, FedDICE observes overhead in the anti-ransomware model training, e.g., <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="28\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1">28</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="id1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">28\times</annotation></semantics></math> for the logistic regression model. Besides, FedDICE utilizes SDN’s dynamic network programmability feature to remove the infected devices in ICE.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The latest advancement of computing paradigms and communications is influencing the revolution of many heterogeneous scenarios. Healthcare is one of the most relevant due to its impact on human well-being. Nowadays, hospitals are adapting their operating theaters and infrastructure with new paradigms, for example, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, to enable open coordination and interoperability of heterogeneous medical devices (e.g., data logging device) and applications (e.g., clinical decision making). These infrastructures are called <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Integrated Clinical Environments (ICE)</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and hold the promise of providing innovative and optimized ways to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients. Moreover, ICE enables a holistic view of the ongoing condition of a patient and improves the patient’s data collection system by creating the IoMT and MCPS around the care of patients. Refer to Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 DICE framework ‣ 2 Background ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for the ICE functional architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, hospitals, including their ICEs, are under cyberattacks. We have been witnessing how hospitals are impacted by multiple types of cyberattacks that expose sensitive data or disrupt critical tasks such as surgeries or treatments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This problem is greatly influenced by having medical devices or computers without enough –or obsolete– cybersecurity mechanisms and connection to the internet. In this context, from current hospitals to the next generation equipped with ICE, the expected healthcare evolution will aggravate the situation because ICE devices have not been designed to satisfy security requirements, and consequently, are vulnerable to cyberattacks such as ransomware.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Ransomware cyberattacks deserve special attention from the research community as they are skyrocketing during this COVID-19 pandemic period in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For example, it is increased by 45% since November 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, they are not new events. They accounted for 85% of all malware, and more than 70% of attacks confirmed data disclosure based on Verizon in 2018 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In January 2018, the Hancock Health Hospital (US) paid attackers $55,000 to unlock systems following a ransomware infection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Considering all, it is evident that without addressing ransomware attacks impacting clinical scenarios, we cannot achieve the benefits of ICE in healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For ransomware detection, various mechanisms have been developed. But, the traditional cybersecurity mechanisms based on signatures, e.g., SIDS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and rule-based static policies, e.g., traditional policy-based detection in software-defined networks (SDN), are no longer suitable for detecting new ransomware families that have not been seen before or use encrypted communications. To solve this drawback, a vast number of solutions based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, ML/DL requires sufficient ransomware data for training and testing its algorithms. Moreover, data should have a good quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, for example, all targeted classes (e.g., ransomware families) to enabling better ML/DL learning on their features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, it is not easy to find all required ransomware data in one hospital’s ICE environment, as one hospital might not suffer from all ransomware families. Thus there is a need for collaboration among hospitals. The straightforward way is to collect the ransomware data directly from the multiple hospital’s ICE and perform machine learning. This approach is called <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">centralized learning</em> (CL). The challenge here is data privacy since the data from ICE is privacy critical as it can contain patients’ health data and can expose the hospitals’ internal ICE networks to others (refer to section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Network flow dataset and its risk ‣ 3 Motivation of FedDICE for the ransomware spread detection ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a> for details). Also, privacy in ICE is recommended by NIST (NIST RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, supra note 57, at v) frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Thus hospitals are reluctant to collaborate with direct data sharing. Besides, the hospitals (ICEs) are separated and located at different geo-locations making the raw data sharing difficult.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, a collaborative healthcare framework is needed, where several hospitals (ICEs) work together to create a powerful anti-ransomware model with data privacy. As the collaborative framework has multiple ICEs (hospitals) located in different places, it is called distributed ICE (DICE). Each participating hospital with its local ICE environment can share its locally trained anti-ransomware models instead of raw ransomware data in DICE. They can use those shared models in two ways; (i) use individually, and (ii) aggregate models to form one global model. The former is not preferred because it is a burden to the hospitals as they need to keep, manage, and update these multiple models received from multiple hospitals with time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, federated learning (FL) is a suitable candidate. FL aggregates the multiple models to form one global model and updates it with time by considering data privacy in a distributed machine learning. Thus this paper integrates FL to DICE, and the integrated framework is called <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedDICE</em>. In ransomware attack scenarios, its spread is one of the major concerns in the connected environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> such as ICE. So, the FedDICE is investigated by focusing on the detection and mitigation of ransomware spread. Specifically, this work presents the performance of FL in ransomware spread detection considering four popular families, namely WannaCry, Petya, BadRabbit and PowerGhost. This is not known yet despite FL’s widespread use in other healthcare scenarios, such as diagnosing medical conditions from medical imaging like MRI scans and X-rays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
For the mitigation of the attacks in ICE, SDN policies are applied to separate the ransomware-infected system/device from the network.</p>

Our results demonstrate that the singly-trained models are not effective in general in detecting different ransomware. Thus collaboration is required if all ransomware data is not available at one hospital.

This is an important research question highlighting the importance of the FL paradigm in DICE, i.e., FedDICE, both from the requirements and performance sides in ransomware spread detection. Our studies demonstrate that FL achieves the baseline performance, i.e., centralized learning, under both the IID and the non-IID ransomware data distribution in FedDICE. Moreover, FL is even better than centralized learning in some cases. Thus one can avoid using privacy-unfriendly centralized learning. Besides, our results show that a simple model such as logistic regression performs well in ransomware spread detection in our setup. Refer to section <a href="#S6.SS5" title="6.5 Results and analysis ‣ 6 Experiments, results, and analysis on the detection of ransomware spread ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.5</span></a> for details.</p>

To standardize the ICE framework for interoperability, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) states a high-level architecture for ICE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The proposed framework is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 DICE framework ‣ 2 Background ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

Netflow is a protocol for collecting, aggregating, and recording traffic flow data in a network, gives you deep network visibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Netflow data of critical infrastructure such as ICE are sensitive. Adversaries can plan for an efficient attack in a network by gathering deep network information from the netflow data of the network. For example, (i) finding a bottleneck of the network can identify the possible target point for the attacker to craft a denial of service attack, and (ii) finding the specific traffic patterns makes it easy for filtering attacks (blocking those traffic in the network). Consequently, a hospital does not want to share their netflow data with outsiders in DICE if raw ransomware data sharing is required. Works have been done to obfuscate the data in network flow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. However, the sanitized data either decreases data quality for machine learning or poses some risk of leakage. The best option is not to share the (netflow) data in the first place but allow the machine learning inference. This is done by integrating FL in DICE, i.e., via FedDICE. Besides, FL enables privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default mechanisms, and it is compliant with data protection regulations such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

As the primary threat is usually due to the infected devices in an ICE, we consider only this threat scenario in this paper. In this scenario, firstly, a device is infected by a certain ransomware type. Then the ransomware spreads over the network to infect other devices/systems, including patient health monitoring devices and database servers, within the (local) ICE framework.
During the development of the anti-ransomware model collaboratively in DICE, we assume that all participating hospitals are honest-but-curious parties. They behave as per our expectation but are only interested in inferring more on data of other hospitals. Also, they do not maliciously behave to alter or affect the anti-ransomware model training/testing process. We also assume that all the participating hospitals have the same network infrastructure and architecture in our studies for simplicity.</p>

The manager runs as a northbound application and interacts with the supernode SDN controller through its northbound application programming interface. It maintains communication with the local (leaf) SDN controller agent. Specifically, the manager performs the following tasks: (a) Maintains communication with the agents running on the local SDN controllers and the central learning node, (b) transforms the parser output to a more readable format for other software modules, (c) based on the central learning node feedback, the manager can create policies that can be installed in the policy repository maintained by the evaluation engine – a system administrator can also install such policies in the policy repository – and (d) conveys central learning node decisions to the enforcer module, and enforces appropriate flow rules in the data plane devices.</p>

In some cases, they can be a separate application, which only utilises the controller information. This approach helps to build an application that can be used with a heterogeneous controller. The agents are running on each local SDN controller. Moreover, there are two agents; PbSA and Fed agents. PbSA is a policy-based security application running on the top of the local SDN controller. Firstly, it mirrors all the incoming packet information and formats them for machine learning purposes. This module also stores the formatted packet information in a local repository. The fed agent (federated machine agent) uses the local storage’s raw data to build the local anti-malware model. Later it coordinates with the manager via parser to forward the local model and receive the global model. The global model is used to detect ransomware spread in local ICEs.</p>

Firstly, each local ICE fed agent regularly trains and updates its anti-ransomware ML model through FL. These models are used as policies in our approach. In contrast to a static policy, which is usually manually updated to detect and mitigate the ransomware spread, the ML model-based policy updates automatically through FL. Then it is applied to detect the ransomware spread in the local ICE. Afterward, the PbSA enforcer executes the policies to remove the infected devices from the ICE if there is any detection.

The dataset has clean and ransomware-generated network traffic information by devices with an operating system, Windows (version: 7 and 10) and Ubuntu (version: 16.04).
There are four popular ransomware families, namely <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text"><em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">WannaCry</em></span> <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">(RW-WC)</span>, <em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Petya</em> (RW-PY), <em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">BadRabbit</em> (RW-BR) and <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text"><em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.5.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">PowerGhost</em></span> <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text">(RW-PG)</span>.
The dataset is generated by considering sliding windows of netflows to obtain a total of 520 features related to transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), address resolution protocol (ARP), and flow features. The sliding windows can have various time duration, including 5s, 10s, and 20s. In the feature generation process, aggregated features are generated using the last flow information of the sliding window duration (e.g., 10s). This is done to collect a wide variety of both the context features and flow features. Refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> for details.

<p id="S6.SS5.SSS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">These results show that there can be some ransomware such as RW-WC and RW-PG, those indicating a possibility of using models trained on network flow information generated by one ransomware to detect each other. However, this is not true in general; for example, models trained on RW-WC or RW-PG have poor performance on RW-PY and RW-BR. This clearly shows that we need collaboration either by direct data sharing or using privacy-preserving techniques such as FL in DICE. The results from the direct data-sharing approach are equivalent to the centralized learning, so we further analyze FL in the following section.</p>

Moreover, its performance is similar to centralized learning (refer to Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 6.5.3 (RQ3) Performance of FedDICE over centralized learning: ‣ 6.5 Results and analysis ‣ 6 Experiments, results, and analysis on the detection of ransomware spread ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(a)), and all three models achieve the best performance; however, the logistic regression (LR) has a relatively slightly better performance. Usually, FL performance is lower than centralized learning (baseline), but we observe a difference in our results. For example, the performance of FNN in FL is higher than its baseline (see Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 6.5.3 (RQ3) Performance of FedDICE over centralized learning: ‣ 6.5 Results and analysis ‣ 6 Experiments, results, and analysis on the detection of ransomware spread ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (a)). The possible reason for this result can be the effect of model aggregation in FL. The weighted averaging of the models in model aggregation can stabilize the fluctuations in the model updates to some extent during the model training in FNN and thus contribute to better performance.</p>

Our network setup has used four mininet simulated hosts (clients) connected to an ONOS SDN controller. In addition, we have tapped one Raspberry pi virtual machine (VM) as one of the hosts in this network. We consider this as an IoT device connected to a hospital network.</p>

The FL models are used as policies to detect the attacks coming towards any hospital node. Our policy syntax is granular and can extend beyond the machine learning model. The policies are extremely customizable. We are using JSON to write the policies. The formulated policies can be used in the SDN controller of any hierarchy. Together with PbSA agent running in the local ICE, the fed agent can automatically forge the policies and install them in the local controller. Also, the FL models get updated in the regular interval from the central learning node located in the supernode, allowing the other lead SDN controller to be aware of the learning model changes. Besides, each policy has multiple sections. Firstly, the source profile (src_profile) refers to the specifics of the packets originating from the source, i.e., from which domain, IP, MAC, and service type the packet is coming from. Secondly, the destination profile (dst_profile) talks about the specifics of the packet destination, i.e., which domain, IP, and MAC address the packet is going to. Thirdly, the flow profile (flow_profile) specifies the flow. A series of packets constitute a flow, and each flow has a specific frequency of packet occurrence that is of specific sizes. Flows can specify payload type in the policy as well. For instance, a policy specifies the flow that needs to be dropped, e.g., flow containing ransomware packets. Fourthly, the machine learning model <math id="S7.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p3.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">W</mi><mi id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1c">W_{t}</annotation></semantics></math> specifies the model used as the policy for checking the incoming packet flow. Finally, each policy comes with an action. An action can be as simple as dropping a flow, or it can be a complicated one that routes the flows via edge devices. For instance, we can route any sensitive healthcare device flows via trusted switching devices. We can signify a wildcard using “*” in any policy field. Listing in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7 Experiments on the mitigation of ransomware spread ‣ FedDICE: A ransomware spread detection in a distributed integrated clinical environment using federated learning and SDN based mitigation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows a sample policy used to detect the custom ransomware attack simulated by us in the SDN infrastructure.

<div id="S8.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In literature, SDN-based ransomware mitigation solutions had been proposed. One of the works considered SDN redirection capabilities together with a blacklist of proxy servers to check if the infected device is trying to connect to one of them to obtain the public encryption key <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
The mitigation consisted of establishing a flow filter to impede this communication, and thus, the encryption of the files. Here the main drawback is the need to keep a blacklist of proxy servers updated. These servers must be identified utilizing behavioral analysis of known malware, thus making it impossible to detect new campaigns. When compared with our solution, our goal is not to prevent the encryption of the files. We attempt to detect ransomware spreading by using the characteristic traffic patterns generated during that stage. Additionally, our mitigation procedure restores the ICE/DICE system to a clean state. In another work, a deep packet inspection was implemented to identify the HTTP POST messages from ransomware <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The authors considered the lengths of each three consecutive HTTP POST messages as a feature vector and train by computing both the centroid of the feature vectors belonging to each ransomware class and a maximal distance to be considered from that class. This approach does not work if the packets are encrypted.</p>

<div id="S8.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are two categories of related works: malware detection and anomaly detection. Various works had been done on the malware detection side, but little attention was given to ransomware detection and mitigation. Usually, these works considered host-based datasets, which are host-based systems’ logs, e.g., event logs in a computer. For industrial IoT, FL was used to detect android malware applications in Industrial IoT (host-based data). Moreover, the authors considered data triggered by poisoning attacks based on GAN for robust training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In separate work, host-based activities log datasets of malware (including ransomware) are considered to carry FL on malware classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. On the anomaly detection side, FL was implemented to detect anomalies in IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The data streaming from each IoT was considered and analyzed where the laptop was considered a gateway <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The IoT was infected with only one malware called Mirai (not a ransomware-type). In contrast, our work has considered the network of networks beyond the gateway (e.g., laptop) and ransomware samples in a DICE environment. In separate work, FL was implemented for network anomaly detection but performed to detect VPN traffic and Tor traffic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Federated deep learning over the network flow dataset, called CIC-IDS2017, using blockchains was implemented for anomaly detection in intrusion detection. Moreover, CIC-IDS2017 did not contain data due to ransomware samples. In our work, we are focused on network security rather than an individual device. Thus, we use a dataset capturing network information (netflow). In contrast to the host-based dataset, our dataset captures completely different characteristics and belongs to a different distribution. It is unclear how the FL approach performs in a network-based ransomware dataset, so we addressed this question in this work.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we presented FedDICE, which is federated learning entangled distributed integrated clinical environment. It enables data privacy by leveraging federating learning. Our results demonstrated that FedDICE effectively detects ransomware spread detection of WannaCry, Petya, BadRabbit, and PowerGhost with a testing accuracy of around 99% in the distributed integrated clinical environment (DICE). This performance is similar to the performance achieved by centralized learning, which is not a privacy-friendly approach. Besides, we implemented a policy-based ransomware spread mitigation technique leveraging the software-defined network functionalities. FedDICE is a generic framework and can be potentially used for other applications such as AI-supported medical decisions with data privacy.</p>
