Through a variety of sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles can collect a wealth of data. However, to make these data useful, sensor data must be integrated effectively. This paper focuses on the integration of image data and vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. More specifically, our goal is to identify the locations of vehicles sending messages within images, a challenge termed the vehicle identification problem. In this paper, we employ a supervised learning model to tackle the vehicle identification problem. However, we face two practical issues: first, drivers are typically unwilling to share privacy-sensitive image data, and second, drivers usually do not engage in data labeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a comprehensive solution to the vehicle identification problem, which leverages federated learning and automatic labeling techniques in combination with the aforementioned supervised learning model. We have validated the feasibility of our proposed approach through experiments.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vehicle environmental awareness refers to a vehicle’s ability to identify and understand its surroundings using various sensing technologies. It is a critical aspect of enhancing road safety and serves as the basis for autonomous driving technology. To enable vehicles to have a more precise understanding of their surroundings, a wide range of sensors are installed in vehicles, including radar, LiDAR, GPS, cameras, and more. Additionally, through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles can exchange information with each other, allowing them to better comprehend the intentions of other vehicles in their vicinity. However, to make these data useful, they must be fused.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Data fusion is the technology that merges data from various sources to create more comprehensive and valuable information. The purpose of data fusion is to gain deeper and more holistic insights than what can be achieved using data from a single source alone. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Budi Christian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, an approach to vehicle environmental awareness is proposed, which involves the fusion of image data and vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. To illustrate the problem it addresses, consider Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We assume that vehicle <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">x</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑥</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">x</annotation></semantics></math> has a camera that captures images in front of vehicle. At the same time, vehicle <math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">x</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑥</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">x</annotation></semantics></math> can receive messages from other surrounding vehicles.

This problem is referred to as the Vehicle Identification (VID) problem.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, MDFNN is a supervised model. This means that after collecting vehicle-to-vehicle communication data and image data, a person must manually pair the vehicle-to-vehicle communication data with the image data to generate sufficient training data to train the MDFNN model. It can be expected that drivers are typically unwilling to perform this labeling task. Therefore, a more viable approach is to upload all the data to the cloud and have dedicated individuals perform the labeling and model training. However, dealing with a large volume of data not only consumes human resources but also requires a significant amount of network bandwidth for data uploading. Additionally, as data carries a certain degree of privacy, uploading data to the cloud raises privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> provides a potential solution to the privacy concerns mentioned above. Federated learning consists of numerous local nodes, also known as federated learning clients, each of which trains a local model based on its locally held data. Subsequently, all local nodes transmit their model parameters to a parameter server. The parameter server aggregates the parameters from these local models and constructs a global model. Then, this global model is returned to the local nodes. Since the global model is a combination of many local models, it is expected to perform better than a model trained by an individual local node. In this process, local nodes do not need to transmit sensitive data to the parameter server; they only need to send their local model parameters. As a result, data privacy is reasonably preserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We can apply federated learning to the aforementioned VID problem. For example, we can treat each vehicle as a local node, where vehicles only need to transmit model parameters to the parameter server, eliminating the need to send privacy-sensitive image data or vehicle-to-vehicle communication data to the server. However, when the model is a supervised model, the local nodes would typically require some labeled training data to train their local models. The challenge then becomes how to acquire labeled data. In the context of our in-vehicle network environment, expecting drivers to perform labeling is essentially impossible. Therefore, in the federated learning environment, local nodes sometimes need an automatic labeling method for their local data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a solution to the VID problem, which combines federated learning and an automatic labeling approach. We refer to this solution as FedMDFNN (Federated MDFNN). In FedMDFNN, we assume the presence of a federated learning parameter server in the cloud, with each vehicle regarded as a local node in the federated learning system. Each vehicle independently trains its local MDFNN based on its acquired data and uploads the relevant MDFNN parameters to the parameter server. The parameter server aggregates these parameters from all local nodes, resulting in new model parameters, which are then transmitted back to each vehicle. In FedMDFNN, each vehicle is not required to upload its private data, ensuring data privacy.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, to address the challenge of labeling training data, this paper introduces an automatic labeling method using license plate recognition and data augmentation techniques. This automatic labeling approach makes FedMDFNN feasible. Finally, we have validated the proposed FedMDFNN through extensive experiments.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the VID problem, we propose a solution called FedMDFNN (Federated MDFNN), which is based on federated learning and automatic labeling. The system architecture of FedMDFNN is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 FedMDFNN ‣ Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Following the architecture of federated learning, FedMDFNN is divided into two components: the federated server and the federated clients. The task of a federated server is to aggregate the model parameters from federated clients to build a global model. Federated clients represent participating vehicles and consist of three modules: (1) data collection module, (2) automatic labeling and data augmentation module, and (3) vehicle mapping module.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We utilize the OCR function provided by the Google Cloud Vision API<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">Google </a></cite> to implement license plate recognition. Additionally, we employ a confusing character table, established through experiments, to refine the OCR recognition results. The reason for creating this table is that, during the license plate recognition process, we observed that certain confusing characters can affect the accuracy of recognition. For example, OCR software often confuses the number 0 with the English letter O or misinterprets the number 1 as the English letter I. Relying solely on an exact matching approach for character comparison would lead to the inability to automatically label a significant amount of data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Through the character conversion table, when a character from a license plate appears in the list of keys, we replace that character with its corresponding value. For example, suppose that we receive a message with the license plate number ‘5CRD321.’ According to Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 3.2.1 Auto Labeling Submodule ‣ 3.2 Auto Labeling and Data Augmentation Module ‣ 3 FedMDFNN ‣ Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, this license plate number is transformed into ‘#3CR#132#2.’ Consequently, even if the OCR recognition software mistakenly interprets it as ‘SCRO32I,’ with the transformed license plate ‘#3CR#132#2,’ we can still successfully match it. To distinguish between converted and unconverted numeric characters, we prepend a ‘#’ symbol to the converted values. In this way, for example, even after conversion, we can correctly distinguish between ‘1ABCEF’ and ‘2ABCEF’. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the vehicle’s ID is generated by the license plate number and a hash function. Before performing the hash calculation, it is necessary to convert the license plate number based on Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 3.2.1 Auto Labeling Submodule ‣ 3.2 Auto Labeling and Data Augmentation Module ‣ 3 FedMDFNN ‣ Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> so that the receiving vehicles can make comparisons.</p>

If this proportion is high, it implies that a simple license plate recognition method is sufficient for pairing, and there may not be a need for a complex vehicle mapping model. On the contrary, if this proportion is low, the training dataset that we can generate might be insufficient. Based on our simulation experiments, we find that the license plate recognition method can successfully match approximately 24% of vehicles in a single photo.</p>

After training its local MDFNN model, each vehicle uploads the MDFNN model parameters to the federated server. Upon receiving the model parameters from the participating vehicles, the federated server aggregates the model parameters and returns the aggregated parameters to the participating vehicles. This process enables the participating vehicles to update their local parameters. Subsequently, the participating vehicles continue training with the updated local parameters, and this process repeats. After a certain number of rounds, a satisfactory global model is generated. This trained global model is then returned to each participating vehicle and used for identifying the positions of vehicles in the images.</p>

In addition, YOLOv5 does not offer a model for license plate recognition. Consequently, we retrained models for both vehicle and license plate recognition.

We observed that as the confidence threshold increased, the recognition accuracy improved, but the number of successfully identified objects decreased. In other words, although precision could be enhanced, recall decreased significantly.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes FedMDFNN, which combines federated learning and automatic labeling to address the vehicle identification problem. Through the federated learning framework, drivers only need to upload local model parameters to aggregate and obtain the global model. This approach ensures user privacy as only parameters are uploaded, reducing network traffic consumption. Furthermore, we integrate automatic labeling and data augmentation to acquire the dataset needed for the FedMDFNN model, eliminating the need for manual labeling. This greatly enhances the overall feasibility of the approach, because typically drivers are reluctant to label data. In the future, we aim to explore the integration of object tracking technology to obtain more training data and enhance the model’s performance. Additionally, as federated learning is extensively studied, we will also consider the common Non-IID issues in federated learning and their impact on the FedMDFNN.</p>
