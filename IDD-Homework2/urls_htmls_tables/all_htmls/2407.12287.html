<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of ubiquitous computing, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is vital for the automation and intelligent identification of human actions through data from diverse sensors. However, traditional machine learning approaches by aggregating data on a central server and centralized processing are memory-intensive and raise privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution by training a global model collaboratively across multiple devices by exchanging their local model parameters instead of local data. However, in realistic settings, sensor data on devices is non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). This means that data activity recorded by most devices is sparse, and sensor data distribution for each client may be inconsistent. As a result, typical FL frameworks in heterogeneous environments suffer from slow convergence and poor performance due to deviation of the global model’s objective from the global objective. Most FL methods applied to HAR are either designed for overly ideal scenarios without considering the Non-IID problem or present privacy and scalability concerns.
This work addresses these challenges, proposing CDFL, an efficient federated learning framework for image-based HAR. CDFL efficiently selects a representative set of privacy-preserved images using contrastive learning and deep clustering, reduces communication overhead by selecting effective clients for global model updates, and improves global model quality by training on privacy-preserved data. Our comprehensive experiments carried out on three public datasets, namely Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, demonstrate the superiority of CDFL in terms of performance, convergence rate, and bandwidth usage compared to state-of-the-art approaches. </p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In an increasingly connected world, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has emerged as a pivotal component in the landscape of ubiquitous computing applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Of particular interest is the image-based HAR which pertains to the automatic and intelligent identification of actions/behaviors exhibited by humans using image data collected from various sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These images are often captured by cameras embedded in a wide array of devices, such as smartphones, surveillance systems, and smart environments. Image-based HAR plays a significant role in various domains, including healthcare for patient monitoring, sports analytics, security surveillance systems, and human-computer interaction in smart environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. As these devices continue to proliferate, they generate vast amounts of data with the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of HAR algorithms. However, centralizing data from multiple sources on powerful servers or cloud platforms for training machine learning models raise several issues including privacy invasions, potential misuse of sensitive personal data, and the significant costs associated with data transmission and centralized processing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a machine learning paradigm that seeks to address the above-mentioned issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. It allows a global model to be trained across multiple decentralized sources (or clients) holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Instead of transferring raw data to a central server, FL involves training machine learning models locally on each device and then aggregating the model weights (or gradients) to construct an improved global model. This approach ensures that sensitive raw data never leaves the local device, thereby significantly enhancing privacy and security of the users. In the context of HAR, FL is especially promising since it allows for the leveraging of extensive, rich, and diverse images collected from multiple sources employed by different individuals in various environments. Such a decentralized approach does not only preserve privacy but also promises to deliver more personalized and context-aware HAR models by learning from data that is representative of heterogeneous user behaviors. Nonetheless, there are three main challenges in FL that limit its potential: data heterogeneity, communication overhead, and naive aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world applications, the data among the clients can be non-IID (independent and identically distributed) which can negatively affect the performance of typical FL system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this scenario, some clients may not contain any sample from some categories of data. Recent studies have proposed methods to address this problem. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> utilizes an <math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\ell_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">ℓ</mi><mn id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">ℓ</ci><cn type="integer" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">\ell_{2}</annotation></semantics></math> regularization term to control the distance between the local and global weights. Personalized FL is another approach that addresses the data heterogeneity issue by training personalized models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In personalized FL, the focus on local data can prevent the clients from exploiting the information lying in the whole distributed dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, some research studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> employ clustered FL to handle the data heterogeneity. In clustered FL, clients with similar data distributions are grouped into the same cluster, where each cluster collaboratively trains its own global model independent of other clusters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In every communication round of conventional FL systems, all active clients must send their weights to the server, which poses challenges in situations where there are limitations in bandwidth. Additionally, there are clients with lower convergence rates compared to others, known as stragglers. Therefore, a strategy is required to select clients intelligently not only to reduce communication overhead but also to achieve better performance in a smaller number of communication rounds. Ouyang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> have proposed cluster-wise straggler dropout and correlation-based client selection techniques to reduce communication overhead for HAR applications. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, an algorithm is proposed to select a subset of devices in resource-constrained environments while achieving the best resource efficiency. The algorithm dynamically selects clients and adaptively adjusts the frequency of model aggregation, considering various factors such as local loss, data size, computational power, resource demands, and the age of updates for each client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For updating the server model in a conventional FL framework such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, a coefficient is assigned to each client according to its number of samples and then clients’ model weights are aggregated using weighted averaging. In this method, the global model’s objective is far from the global objective for the whole distributed dataset, and it has a negative effect on the convergence rate of the FL system especially in a heterogeneous state. To overcome this issue, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have proposed a novel aggregation method based on parameter sensitivity. Their method resolves the global model drifting by increasing updates for less sensitive parameters and diminishing updates for parameters with higher levels of sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Although existing FL frameworks focus on addressing one or two of these challenges, there is a need to propose a comprehensive FL framework to resolve all of the above challenges. In this work, we propose, CDFL, an efficient federated learning framework for image-based human activity recognition to resolve the above challenges. Our proposed method not only shows an overall improvement in system performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods but also reduces the communication overhead between the server and various clients.

Since the chosen dataset is a good representative of the entire dataset, it effectively overcomes the data heterogeneity challenge.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a prominent distributed machine learning approach that has attracted attention in recent years. The main goal of FL is to preserve privacy through decentralized learning. The first attempt in this area is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> algorithm. Although the results obtained from FedAvg are promising compared to centralized learning, this scheme suffers from several challenges, including data heterogeneity, communication overhead, and naive aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the data heterogeneity issue, Li <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> presented a model-contrastive federated learning (MOON) to similarize the representation of local models to those of the global model. While MOON performs effectively when the global model is consistent with the global objective, it overlooks the fact that a deviated global model, particularly in strongly heterogeneous conditions, can lead to deviation of all local clients from the global objective. Another category of algorithms focuses on clustered FL to manage heterogeneous states such as cFedFN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, IFCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, FedCluster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, FedGroup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, FlexCFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, CFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. IFCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is an iterative federated clustering algorithm that alternates between estimating the cluster identities and minimizing the loss function. This method does not need a centralized clustering algorithm, leading to a considerable reduction in server computational cost. It has been shown that the convergence rate of their proposed algorithm follows the exponential curve. CFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> is another cluster-based FL framework that does not require any prior knowledge about the number of clusters. In this framework, the geometric properties of the FL loss are leveraged for client clustering. Further, they discovered that by calculating the cosine similarity between client weights, the similarity of their data distribution can be perceived. In cFedFN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Wei <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> have argued that feature norm is a suitable metric to cluster clients in view of its capability to reflect the clients’ data distribution. By leveraging feature norms for clustering, a performance improvement is achieved without the need for any pre-clustering steps. The additional computation cost required for feature norm calculation of cFedFN is negligible, which makes it applicable in real-life situations. While clustered FL methods can mitigate data heterogeneity issues by identifying underlying client clusters, clustering becomes challenging as the number of clients increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A number of existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have focused on communication overhead reduction to handle bandwidth-limited situations. Chen <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> have designed a probabilistic client selection such that clients that can potentially enhance the convergence rate are selected with higher probability in the following communication round. Besides, in this scheme, a quantization method has been developed to shrink the model parameters before transmission to the server. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, an asynchronous model update algorithm is proposed to reduce
client-server communication. In this algorithm, the various layers of the model are divided into shallow and deep categories. The parameters in the deep category of layers are updated less often compared to the parameters in the shallow layers. With this strategy, the number of parameters to be exchanged between the server and clients is reduced per communication round. Although their proposed strategy is successful in reducing the total communication cost, it needs more communication rounds to achieve a target accuracy compared to FedAvg. The FetchSGD algorithm, presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, is based on the Count Sketch data structure to overcome the communication bottleneck issue. The FetchSGD sends the sketches of each local client to the server for aggregation. In the server, the momentum and error accumulation are applied to the aggregated sketch. Then, top-k values are selected as sparse updates to broadcast to the connected clients in the following round.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the server side, naive aggregation of local models suffers from global drift in heterogeneous situations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and therefore, deteriorates the FL performance. Chen <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> have designed a temporally weighted aggregation strategy to resolve this issue. This scheme is based on timestamps, and local clients with recent updates get larger weights compared to other clients. FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> has used parameter averaging of the local clients by utilizing a permutation matrix. Specifically,
this scheme ensures that similar elements in the model, like channels in convolution layers or neurons in fully connected layers, are matched and averaged appropriately. However, the computational cost of finding the optimal permutation matrix hinders its practical usage. EK <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> introduced a new aggregation algorithm called FedDist, which follows a similar approach to FedMA but focuses on identifying differences between specific neurons among the clients to modify the global model’s architecture. It has been demonstrated that this algorithm considers the clients’ specificity without affecting the overall performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many existing works in HAR applications still rely on central servers to train their models. This exposes the users’ data to substantial privacy threats, especially when dealing with sensitive user information. To maintain user privacy, federated learning has been increasingly adopted in the context of HAR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Xiao <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> paid attention to the structure of the model in the FL system. They designed an FL system with an advanced feature extractor for recognizing human activities. This feature extractor consists of two main components. The initial component utilizes convolutional layers to capture local features, while the second component combines LSTM and attention layers to uncover the global relationships within the data.
Another line of studies tries to tackle data heterogeneity in HAR applications. Gad <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> introduced Federated Learning via Augmented Knowledge Distillation (FedAKD) to manage the heterogeneous state. They have demonstrated that FedAKD not only surpasses FedAvg in terms of communication efficiency but also outperforms FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> due to the incorporation of augmentation techniques.
FedDL, as presented in Tu et al.’s work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, is another FL framework tailored for activity recognition purposes under non-IID circumstances. FedDL clusters clients based on the similarity of model weights and subsequently integrates models through an iterative layer-wise approach. With this strategy, the system dynamically acquires personalized models for distinct users. Although FedAKD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and FedDL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> address the data heterogeneity issue, they do not resolve the communication overhead problem that can be challenging in large scale scenarios. ClusterFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> also directed its attention toward client clustering, in which, the cluster indicative matrix that captures the similarity between users, is utilized. By employing alternating optimization techniques, they iteratively update both local models and the cluster indicator matrix.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some research endeavors focus on the FL system in a semi-supervised approach to address the limited availability of labeled samples in the HAR problem. Notably, Bettini <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> introduced FedHAR which is a semi-supervised FL framework. Specifically, in this scheme, a combination of active learning and label propagation is employed to semi-automatically annotate data for each individual client, effectively addressing the scarcity of labeled samples. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, a semi-supervised learning-based HAR scheme is proposed, in which clients train autoencoders in an unsupervised approach with their unlabeled local data while the server trains an activity classifier through supervised learning. Their scheme can achieve competitive performance compared to the supervised approach in the HAR application.

<p id="S3.I1.i1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Utilizing original images poses privacy concerns since they could inadvertently disclose participant identities. To address this, we propose another model for every client, that is trained with the pixelized visual signals. By employing image pixelization, it is assured that the sensitive data in the images, in our case the faces, are masked. Hence, in addition to sending the parameters of each local model to the server, we can transmit their pixelized data (that preserves the human identities) as well. This strategy could have a positive impact on enhancing the FL performance.</p>

While earlier efforts largely focused on client clustering to mediate data heterogeneity, our research harnesses image clustering to transmit a minimal number of representative pixelized images to the server in order to enhance the FL performance. It should be noted that local data remains unshared with servers or other clients in conventional FL systems. As delineated in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Model Contrastive Learning ‣ III Proposed Approuch ‣ CDFL: Efficient Federated Human Activity Recognition using Contrastive Learning and Deep Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>, pixelized images effectively obscure individual sensitive data and contain the necessary information for performing the task of HAR. Nonetheless, the indiscriminate transmission of all pixelized images is memory-consuming and inefficient, emphasizing the need for efficient image selection methodologies.</p>

For obtaining high-quality centroids for each client, their sample count should be considerably large relative to this space.

In this prevalent deep clustering strategy, first, cluster centroids are derived through methods like k-means clustering. These centroids serve as the reference points for assigning data samples to their corresponding clusters. These assigned cluster labels are then considered as the samples’ pseudo-labels. Subsequently, the model is re-trained with the objective of aligning the representations of the samples with their corresponding cluster centroids.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The advantages of the proposed image selection method are two-fold. Firstly, it employs global model representations for obtaining the pseudo-labels, and hence, provides centroids with a global view from all clients. This prevents the deviation of the local model from the global model during local model training. Secondly, the global and local models are updated in each communication round. As a result, the selected images are dynamically refined to improve performance over time.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional FL systems, during each communication round, the central server aggregates model weights from all connected clients to update the global model. There exist three issues with using this approach. First, due to the data heterogeneity among clients, the aggregated global model is far from the global objective. Second, it necessitates significant memory and bandwidth resources, which might be unattainable in many real-world scenarios. Third, some clients may demonstrate slower convergence compared to others. Including such clients during the global model update can detrimentally impact the convergence rate of the entire FL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the end of each communication round, the local models are applied to the
test samples to evaluate their individual performance. Then, the performance of all connected clients is averaged to obtain the performance of the scheme. The mean accuracy of all schemes, tested with varying numbers of clients (10, 20, and 30), is summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Performance Comparison ‣ IV Experiments ‣ CDFL: Efficient Federated Human Activity Recognition using Contrastive Learning and Deep Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. First, we have to say CDFL is the best. The SOLO approach consistently exhibits the poorest performance across all settings, representing the beneficial impact of the FL framework in decentralized learning. As the number of clients increases, there is a drop in performance across all schemes.
In the case of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, this drop is particularly significant, ranging from 7% to 16% among different datasets. The relatively lower accuracy of FedAvg can be attributed to its limited ability to handle heterogeneous conditions. The performance improvement of CDFL in comparison to MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> is up to 4.2%, 7.1%, and 9.8% for Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, respectively. Among the baselines, the performance of FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> is closer to CDFL. Compared to FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, CDFL improves the performance up to 1.3%, 5.4%, and 5.7% in Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, respectively.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Performance Comparison ‣ IV Experiments ‣ CDFL: Efficient Federated Human Activity Recognition using Contrastive Learning and Deep Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, CDFL consistently outperforms all other baselines across various settings, demonstrating the strength of CDFL in comparison to previous works. In general, CDFL has a smaller standard deviation compared to other baselines. This implies that it not only works well on the whole set of clients according to its higher mean accuracy but also performs well on all individual clients due to its low standard deviation. In contrast, the higher standard deviation in other baselines represents difficulties in achieving good performance on some clients due to non-IID data distribution. Furthermore, CDFL is still able to provide higher performance, even when the number of clients increases, which is crucial in realistic applications where the number of clients is often large.</p>

It is worth noting that Stanford40 is selected for these large-scale scenarios due to the small size of other datasets, whose number of samples is approximately 50% of the samples available in Stanford40. Since the number of clients increases, the number of communication rounds is set to 30 to make sure that all schemes converge to optimal solutions.</p>

As expected, the SOLO approach exhibits a significant drop in performance when the number of clients increases. Among the baseline methods we considered, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and FedHKD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> perform similarly to FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, struggling to handle a large number of clients effectively. In contrast, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> and FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> show improved performance compared to the other baselines in large-scale settings.
As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-C Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ CDFL: Efficient Federated Human Activity Recognition using Contrastive Learning and Deep Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, CDFL consistently outperforms the other baselines in the case of large-scale FL setups. The higher mean performance of CDFL implies its ability to effectively manage a large number of clients. Furthermore, its lower standard deviation compared to other baselines demonstrates its consistent performance across all the individual clients.</p>

Uplink includes the transmission of local models to the server, while downlink corresponds to broadcasting the updated global model to the clients. As the downlink overhead is considerably lower than the uplink, our analysis focuses on the uplink overhead.
In this study, we define the number of tansmitted parameters as communication overhead metric.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces CDFL as an efficient FL framework for recognizing human activities. It is designed specifically to address the prevalent challenges of data heterogeneity, communication overhead, and naive aggregation. CDFL introduces a privacy-preserved subset of samples to the central server to enhance the performance of the system in a secure manner. To optimize the selection of representative data samples for each activity, we integrated methods of contrastive learning, knowledge distillation, and deep clustering. Furthermore, our new client selection method offers the dual advantage of reducing communication overheads and enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on three well-known image-based HAR datasets highlight the efficacy of CDFL in both classification accuracy and communication efficiency. Overall, a performance increase of up to 10%, a bandwidth usage reduction of 64% as well as a faster convergence rate of up to 10 times in comparison to the state-of-the-art schemes is achieved.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, several directions of the proposed work will be investigated. First, we want to study the influence of degraded image quality on the efficacy of our system. This assessment is pivotal given the real-world scenarios where image quality can vary depending on the sensor and external factors. Furthermore, we will design a robust and efficient FL framework for the multimodal HAR task that combines signals from various modalities, including visual, audio, inertial, and biological signals.</p>
