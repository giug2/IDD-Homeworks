<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) has initiated a new era in service computing and collaborates with the field of federated learning, an approach to machine learning that allows collaborative model building among multiple clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
However, according to recent regulations like the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and CCPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, users have the right to request the deletion of their data. Consequently, there emerged a new technology called machine unlearning, that integrate into federated learning to meet those regulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The need for machine unlearning stems from the imperative to systematically remove specific data from trained models in IoT environments. Currently, there are several methods to achieve machine unlearning in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, existing machine unlearning techniques suffer from one critical issue: when they have deployed in servicing computing: the model owner cannot provide users with evidence that their data has truly been unlearned.
In other words, users must blindly believe that the server has executed the unlearning oracle to remove the influence of their data, with little opportunity to verify it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This makes the entire unlearning process untrustworthy and may lead to concerns about privacy. An untrustworthy service providers may pretend to have performed the unlearning operation but actually take no action to avoid high computational costs or utility decreasing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain technology, renowned for its immutability, transparency, and robust security, does more than just establish a foundation of trust for digital transactions and record-keeping. It also extends this trust paradigm to machine unlearning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This integration leverages the strengths of blockchain to address trust issues, offering several key advantages:
First, blockchain guarantees that each step in the unlearning process is immutably recorded, ensuring a verifiable and transparent certification of data removal actions. This level of transparency is crucial for auditability, allowing stakeholders to easily trace and verify all unlearning actions, thereby assuring the integrity of the process.
Second, blockchain’s robust security framework is instrumental in preventing unauthorized alterations, a vital aspect for maintaining reliable certification. Finally, its decentralized nature spreads the trust mechanism across multiple nodes, effectively eliminating single points of failure and bolstering the system’s resilience in certifying unlearning actions. The convergence of these benefits significantly bolsters the trustworthiness of the unlearning process in federated learning environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The blockchain layer functions as a decentralized ledger, providing an audit trail that confirms the accurate execution of unlearning requests. This design significantly increases the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model.
If we introduce a trustworthy machine unlearning framework that is based on the combination of blockchain and federated learning, we will have a certified machine unlearning technology.</p>

For certification, our framework employs smart contracts to automate and streamline the verification and validation of unlearning requests, ensuring their authenticity and accurate processing. Regarding security and privacy, we integrate differential privacy mechanisms into the smart contracts. This integration adds an extra layer of data protection, safeguarding confidentiality while maintaining transparent unlearning processes. Efficiency is enhanced by optimizing the storage of federated learning training process data. This adjustment minimizes computational overhead, ensuring that blockchain technology integration does not compromise the system’s performance too much, especially in time-sensitive IoT applications.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of federated learning and machine unlearning is a subject of increasing interest in current research.

For instance, Liu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> delve into this area by proposing a rapid retraining method for efficient data removal in federated learning (FL), crucial for adhering to the ’right to be forgotten.’ This approach highlights the challenges of implementing unlearning in decentralized systems like FL, where data remains local to participants. Our proposed method builds upon this by incorporating blockchain technology into the FL framework for machine unlearning. This not only maintains FL efficiency but also adds a new level of transparency and accountability through the immutable ledger of blockchain, providing a verifiable and tamper-proof record of unlearning activities, crucial for IoT environments.</p>

This structure ensures that once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, which requires network consensus. This characteristic makes blockchain an ideal technology for applications that require a high degree of trust and transparency, such as smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</p>

This jwt is crucial for secure information transmission and identity verification. Subsequently, the algorithm updates the user pool with the new identifiers, marking the successful registration of the entities. It concludes by returning the registration status and the generated jwt, ensuring a robust foundation for the secure operation of the system. This algorithmic approach effectively mitigates duplicate entries and maintains the integrity of the registration process, which is essential for the system’s overall functionality.</p>

The <span id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">epoch</span> setting will be adjusted to enhance system efficiency. During the training, for each epoch from 1 to n, clients upload their computed gradients to the SC. The algorithm also incorporates a check for the validity of the client’s jwt token; if the token is found to be invalid, it returns a notification of the token’s expiration and terminates. For each valid epoch, the SC adds <span id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DP()</span> to received gradients and then publishes the DP(gradients) on the blockchain network. Once all epochs are processed, the <span id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ModelUpdate</span> flag is set to true, indicating successful completion of the model updating process. This algorithm plays a vital role in ensuring the synchronization and consistency of training across clients, contributing to the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the federated learning system.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In evaluating the MNIST dataset’s performance, we closely analyzed the model’s response during and after the unlearning process. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII-B1 MNIST Dataset Results ‣ VII-B Results and Analysis ‣ VII Performance evaluation ‣ Federated Learning with Blockchain-Enhanced Machine Unlearning: A Trustworthy Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, we compared loss trends between normal training and post-unlearning phases. During the training epochs, the loss trajectory for normal training consistently remained lower than that of the unlearning phase. This pattern began with a sharp decline in the early epochs, followed by stabilization over time. Notably, while there was a temporary increase in loss for the unlearning client, this eventually leveled off, approximating the normal client loss, albeit at a slightly higher value.</p>
