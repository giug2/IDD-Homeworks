<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Message exchange among vehicles plays an important role in ensuring road safety. Emergency message dissemination is usually carried out by broadcasting. However, high vehicle density and mobility usually lead to challenges in message dissemination such as broadcasting storm and low probability of packet reception. This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by processing the proposed Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is embedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical analysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed blockchain based federated learning results in more number of vehicles uploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more accurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using blockchain. It also outperforms the other blockchain approaches for message dissemination by reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least 8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbor vehicle more efficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in federated learning and message dissemination is further analyzed using Stackelberg game model.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) is growing into Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) to manage large amounts of data transmission, computation and storage and to meet the increasing requirements of infotainment and road safety <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. An IoV enables Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications including Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. V2I communication usually refers to an infrastructure dependent VANET, where a cellular base station or a Road Side Unit (RSU) is used to provide a real-time and reliable traffic information. However, a large number of RSUs to provide full coverage in urban areas and high traffic densities require huge installation and maintenance cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Therefore, effective and reliable infrastructure-less V2V communication is necessary in emergency situations such as accidents and traffic jams, so that traffic information can be exchanged in real time, even if RSU is out of reach. In V2V communications, multi-hop relaying is one of the challenges to successfully deliver a message over a wide area. Optimal relay selection mechanisms result in better coverage, more reliable connectivity and less communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Various intelligent relay selection schemes depending on a vehicle’s distance from predecessor, moving direction, speed and propagation loss in environment have been proposed using fuzzy logic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or machine learning algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Existing literature shows improved packet delivery ratio by machine learning algorithms in multi-hop V2V communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, artificial intelligence methods require huge processing power and are often not suitable for a fully distributed architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a traditional centralized architecture of machine learning, the data collected by mobile devices is uploaded and processed in a cloud based server to produce inference models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. With potentially large number of autonomous vehicles, where real-time decisions have to be made within a restricted time period, a cloud-centric approach is unable to offer acceptable latency and scalability. Also, a centralized architecture requires full connectivity which is challenging for vehicular networks. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach, in which mobile devices collect data and train their individual machine learning or deep learning models, called local models. They send their local models (i.e., models’ weights) to an aggregator. The aggregator averages local models and produces a global model. Mobile devices further train the global model individually to create updated local models and submit them to aggregator. The steps are repeated in multiple iterations until a desired accuracy of global model is achieved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. FL is considered as a feasible solution for safety and time critical applications involving autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite offering a distributed approach, FL still relies on a central aggregator. Furthermore, it needs a sustainable economic model to incentivize mobile devices based on their contributions and prevent adversary attacks. For example, in IoV, a malicious vehicle may deliberately modify data, causing poisoning attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> or a selfish vehicle may not cooperate in data collection resulting in inaccurate weights of a local model. Blockchain can be used with FL to provide a decentralized solution, for managing incentives and ensuring security and privacy in a trustworthy manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A blockchain is a distributed ledger of immutable blocks which are added after undergoing a set of rules called consensus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain complements both FL and IoV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, smart contracts, which are self executing scripts stored in blockchain to enforce a set of rules, allow automation of multi-step processes and interaction among mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Therefore, they can be used to set rules for protecting FL from adversary and security attacks. The process of transaction verification in blockchain can also be utilized to validate local models in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Blockchain based Federated Learning for Message Dissemination in Vehicular Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> summarizes the current issues of FL in IoV and corresponding solutions provided by blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Practical implementation of blockchain in vehicular networks is challenging. Due to limited connectivity duration in V2V communications, moving vehicles may not always have an updated blockchain ledger, which leads to possibility of multiple blocks added in parallel, called forks, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Blockchain based Federated Learning for Message Dissemination in Vehicular Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a). With presence of forks, it is difficult for all vehicles in a network to attain a synchronized linear structure of ledger. As a common practice, blockchain picks one of the parallel blocks to continue, and meanwhile, disqualifies other forking blocks by longest chain acceptance protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Forks also lead to creation of malicious chains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, the hierarchical structure of blockchain is proposed for vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In a hierarchical structure, there are two types of blocks: keyblock and microblock. Instead of a linear ledger, microblocks representing off-chain transactions are added in parallel, whereas keyblocks are main blocks which are appended horizontally in a blockchain by a leader or a central node, for example, RSU. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Blockchain based Federated Learning for Message Dissemination in Vehicular Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b), parallel addition of microblocks does not disturb the main linear ledger and forks are not disqualified but accepted as off-chain micro-transactions recorded in a decentralized manner.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Relay selection in V2V communications plays a crucial role in message broadcasting. An inappropriate relay may cause unacceptable latency or sometimes failure in delivering a message to a desired number of vehicles or area. Probabilistic calculations are usually used to predict either the distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or link stability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> of a relay node. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a Proof-of-Quality-Factor (PoQF) is established using probabilistic estimation of both distance and Signal to Noise Interference Ratio (SINR) as a merit of relay node selection. However, probabilistic predictions rely on certain approximations, for example, number of vehicles within a transmission range, which may not be highly accurate with varying speeds. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the combination of distance of a vehicle from previous sender and channel quality parameters are used to determine link stability for relay node selection. It is crucial to set weights of all parameters according to their impacts on message delivery in a network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To make relay selection more adaptive to network changes, artificial intelligence based mechanisms are designed. Fuzzy logic has been used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which makes decision according to distance, moving direction and speed of vehicles. However, fuzzy logic is also dependent on thresholds and weights to be set in the rule base for making inferences. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, satellite images are used to detect buildings and obstacles to enable machine learning driven channel characterization. The path with lowest propagation loss is used for message dissemination in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. RSU assisted deep learning based technique is developed for relay selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. It is pointed out that machine learning and deep learning algorithms require large processing power to handle huge amount of data and therefore they must require V2I communications and infrastructure support for implementation.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FL is used to tackle energy transfer issues of electric vehicles at charging stations and has resulted in improved accuracy of energy demand prediction. FL assisted blockchain is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to adjust block arrival rate in order to reduce communication latency and consensus delay among vehicles. Applications of FL in vehicular networks are summarized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and most of the recent applications focus on resource management, performance optimization in computing tasks and user-end services. However, FL can also be promising in message delivery and relay node selection.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Economic models to strategize incentives and to promote mobile devices for producing reliable local models have been developed. For a blockchain based FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the authors have suggested to incentivize vehicles for both model training and block mining. A joint price and reputation based economic model is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to incentivize devices according to the size of data contributed and prevent poisoning attack. The economic model is analyzed using Contract Theory. In Contract Theory, the contracts are formed between a payer and a service provider (i.e., devices training local models) before initiation of FL process. FL among vehicles for image classification is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and contracts are formulated to incentivize vehicles in proportion to the number of images used and amount of computation resources consumed.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Stackelberg game approach is used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to analyze the actions of players when incentives are distributed after FL iterations are completed. If relay nodes are involved in incentive distribution among vehicles, the economic model is more suited to be analyzed using Stackelberg game model. Due to varying speed and position of vehicles, it is practically better to select an appropriate relay node after a message is originated. Therefore, analysis using Stackelberg game model is a more feasible option for multi-hop relay selection scheme than Contract Theory, because formation of contract prior to FL process initiation or relay selection cannot be materialized. The existing literature assumes information asymmetry, i.e. the payer is not aware of the amount of contributions (for example, data size) upon which the payment is to be made. However, with public blockchain, where stored transactions are visible to every member of blockchain, FL can be a case of symmetric information, i.e., the relevant information is known to all associated members.</p>

It is added after passing a security check performed by the smart contract embedded in FL blockchain. The proposed security check employs a machine learning algorithm called Isolation Forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to detect anomaly in a local model caused by adversary. Isolation Forest is used because it only requires a small number of samples for training. A true sample is provided by the Central Authority for its initial training.

Moreover, it is computationally efficient and has low memory requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. We have used the security check in three ways. Firstly, the security check on dataset is conducted by finding anomalies in dataset of each vehicle.

Thirdly, the security check on both dataset and weights is performed. If local models successfully pass the security check, they are added in FL blockchain in the form of parallel microblocks.

On the other hand, malicious vehicles can change all parameters in dataset and therefore it is not easy to detect anomaly on such dataset. It shows that security check on weights is more suitable to prevent poisoning attack caused by malicious vehicles and security check on dataset is more appropriate to reduce the effect of selfish behavior. Nevertheless, malicious vehicles may submit a true dataset for security check and upload inaccurate local models using a false dataset. Therefore, in this case, only security check on weights can prevent adversary caused by malicious vehicles. The loss function is minimum if security check on both dataset and weights is used and is suitable for both malicious and selfish vehicles. As a trade-off, increased computation is required to run security check twice.</span></p>

This is because PoQF waits for a threshold number of votes to determine a relay node and the optimum threshold increases with rising number of vehicles and malicious vehicles percentage. Time delay of PoS rises with increasing number of vehicles due to more time required in accessing large amount of reputation values but it is independent of percentage of malicious vehicles. PoFL is run by each vehicle simultaneously and therefore its time delay is independent of both number of vehicles and percentage of malicious vehicles. On an average, PoFL is 65.2% faster than PoQF in relay selection and is more suitable for time-critical emergency situations. As a trade-off, PoQF only involves Quality Factor calculations but PoFL is based on a computationally expensive FL process with multiple iterations. Compared to PoS, PoFL is 15.74% faster when there are 300 vehicles but 18.93% slower when there are 100 vehicles. This is because PoS consumes time only in accessing the blockchain to find reputation of vehicles. The access time increases when there is a large number of vehicles registered in a blockchain network. Although PoS with 100 vehicles outperforms both PoQF and PoFL, this faster consensus for block verification and addition cannot be run independently for appropriate relay selection, unlike PoQF and PoFL.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized FL based message dissemination, governed by blockchain. The theoretical and practical performance of uploading local models using blockchain is compared with a centralized approach without blockchain. The proposed FL with blockchain can be considered as a faster approach since it results in greater number of uploaded local models within a given time as compared to a solution without blockchain. Smart contract based security checks are proposed to detect adversary, which result in lower MSE in less number of iterations achieved by global model than FL without security check, after 100 iterations. Compared with other blockchain approaches suitable for relay selection in vehicular networks, the proposed solution is 65.2% faster and at least 8.2% more efficient in message dissemination approach. It also preserves privacy of neighbour vehicles, unlike other relay selection approaches. An economic model for blockchain based FL is also proposed and analyzed using Stackelberg game to determine optimal data size and incentive which result in the best response strategy of vehicles. Message dissemination and relay selection can further be improved in future work by including cross-layer information in dataset, obtained from physical and MAC layers.</span></p>
