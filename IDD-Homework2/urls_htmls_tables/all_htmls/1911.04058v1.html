<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We study the problem of visual question answering (VQA) in images by exploiting supervised domain adaptation, where there is a large amount of labeled data in the source domain but only limited labeled data in the target domain with the goal to train a good target model. A straightforward solution is to fine-tune a pre-trained source model by using those limited labeled target data, but it usually cannot work well due to the considerable difference between the data distributions of the source and target domains. Moreover, the availability of multiple modalities (<em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, images, questions and answers) in VQA poses further challenges to model the transferability between those different modalities. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a novel supervised multi-modal domain adaptation method for VQA to learn joint feature embeddings across different domains and modalities. Specifically, we align the data distributions of the source and target domains by considering all modalities together as well as separately for each individual modality.
Based on the extensive experiments on the benchmark VQA 2.0 and VizWiz datasets for the realistic open-ended VQA task, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in this challenging domain adaptation setting for VQA.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of visual question answering (VQA) is building a model to answer questions given an image-question pair. Recently, it has received much attention of the researchers in the area of computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. VQA requires techniques from both image recognition and natural language processing, and most existing works use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features from images and Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) to generate textual features from questions, and combine them to generate the final answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, most of the existing VQA datasets are artificially created and thus may not be suitable as training data for real-world applications. For example, VQA 2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Visual7W <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, arguably two of the most popular datasets for VQA, were created using images from MSCOCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> with questions asked by crowd workers. Therefore, the images are typically of high quality and the questions are less conversational than the reality. On the contrary, the recently proposed VizWiz <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> dataset was collected from blind people who take photos and ask questions about them. Therefore, the images in VizWiz are often of poor quality, and questions are more conversational while some of the questions might be unanswerable due to the poor quality of the images. The VizWiz dataset reflects more realistic setting for VQA, but its size is much smaller due to the difficulty of collecting such data. A straightforward method to solve this problem is to first train a model on the VQA 2.0 dataset and then fine-tune it using the VizWiz data. This solution can only provide limited improvement. There are two major issues. First, the VQA datasets are constructed in a different way, making them differ significantly in visual features, textual features and answers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> did an experiment to classify different VQA datasets with a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of one hidden layer, which achieved over 98% accuracy. This is a strong indication of the significant bias across different datasets. Our experiments also show that directly fine-tuning the model trained on VQA 2.0 results in minor improvement on VizWiz. Second, the two modalities (visual and textual) also pose a big challenge on the generalizability across datasets. It is challenging to consistently bridge the domain gap in a coordinated fashion when multiple modalities are involved due to the nature of the multi-modal heterogeneity with no common feature representations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Domain adaptation methods, which handle the difference between two domains, have been developed to address the first issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. However, most of the existing domain adaptation methods focus on single-modal tasks such as image classification and sentiment classification, and thus may not be directly applicable to multi-modal settings. On the other hand, these methods usually are subject to a strong assumption on the label distribution in that the source domain and the target domain share the same (usually small) label space, which may be unrealistic in real-world applications. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a new framework for unsupervised multi-modal domain adaptation, but it did not target at the VQA tasks. Recently, several VQA domain adaptation methods have been proposed to address the multi-modal challenge. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing VQA domain adaptation methods focus on the multiple choice setting, where several answer candidates are provided and the model only needs to select one from them. In contrast, we focus on a more challenging open-ended setting where there is no prior knowledge of answer choices and the model can select any term from a vocabulary.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we address the aforementioned challenges by proposing a novel multi-modal domain adaptation framework. We develop a method under the framework which can simultaneously learn a domain invariant and downstream-task-discriminative multi-modal feature embedding based on an adversarial loss and a classification loss. We additionally incorporate the maximum mean distance (MMD) to further reduce the domain distribution mismatch

We conduct experiments on two popular VQA benchmark datasets.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA Datasets</span> Over the past few years, several VQA datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and tasks were proposed to encourage researchers to develop algorithms that answer visual questions. One limitation of many existing datasets is that they were created either automatically or from an existing large vision dataset like MSCOCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and the questions were either generated automatically or contrived by human annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Therefore, the images in these datasets are typically of high quality but the questions are less conversational. They might not be directly applicable to real-world applications such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> which aims to answer the visual questions asked by blind people in their daily life. The main differences between <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and other artificial VQA datasets are as follows: 1) Both the image and question quality of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are lower as they suffer from poor lighting, out of focus and audio recording problems like clipping a question at either end or catching background audio content; 2) The questions can be unanswerable since blind people cannot verify whether the images contain the visual content they are asking about, due to blurring, inadequate lighting, framing errors, finger covering the lens, <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc.</em> Our experiments also reveal that fine-tuning the model trained on the somewhat artificial VQA 2.0 dataset provides limited improvement on VizWiz, due to the significant difference in bias between these two datasets.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA Settings</span> There are two main VQA settings, namely multiple choice and open-ended. Under the multiple choice setting, the model is provided with multiple candidates of answers and is expected to select the correct one from them. VQA models following this setting usually take characteristics of all answer candidates like word embeddings as the input to make a selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, in the open-ended setting, there is neither prior knowledge nor answer candidates provided, and the model can respond with any free-form answers. This makes this setting more challenging and realistic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA Models</span> Recently, a plethora of VQA models were proposed by researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Most of them consist of image and question encoders, and a multi-modal fusion module followed by a classification module. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> used an LSTM to encode the question and a residual network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to compute the image features with a soft attention mechanism. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> implemented a bottom-up attention using Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to extract features of detected image regions, and then a top-down mechanism used task-specific context to predict an attention distribution over the image regions. The final output was generated by an MLP after fusing the image and question features. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> used a bilinear attention between two groups of input channels on top of low-rank bilinear pooling which extracted the joint representations for each pair of channels. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed an approach that takes original image features, bottom-up attention features from object detection module, question features and the optical character recognition (OCR) strings detected from the image as the input, and answers either with an answer from the fixed answer vocabulary or by selecting one of the OCR strings detected in the image. Similar to the state-of-the-art model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, our VQA base model also takes original image features, bottom-up attention features and question features to predict the final answer.

Recent works typically focused on transferring neural networks from a labeled source domain to a target domain where there is no or limited labeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> optimized for domain invariance to facilitate domain transfer and used a soft label distribution matching loss to transfer information between tasks. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing and a GAN loss to reduce the difference between domains. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> estimated empirical Wasserstein distance between the source and the target samples and optimized the feature extractor network to minimize the estimated Wasserstein distance in an adversarial manner. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> utilized gradient reversal layer to incorporate the training process of domain classifier, label classifier and feature extractor to align domains. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> simultaneously minimized the classification error, preserved the structure within and across domains, and restricted similarity on target samples. The major difference between our work and these works is that we propose a novel multi-modal domain adaptation framework, while these works assumed a single modality.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Domain Adaptation for VQA</span> Although domain adaptation has been successfully applied to computer vision tasks, its applicability to VQA has yet to be well-studied. There was a recent work that investigated domain adaptation for VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. It reduces the difference in statistical distributions by transforming the feature representation of the data in the target domain. However, one major limitation is the assumption of a multiple choice setting, where four answer candidates are provided as the input to the model. It is unrealistic in real-world applications because one can never guarantee that the ground truth answer is among four candidates. Moreover, it is unclear how to create answer candidates for an image-question pair. On the contrary, our model is only provided with an image-question pair and can generate any free-form answers. This makes our task more challenging and realistic.</p>

In this way, the data from the source domain and the target domain are projected onto a similar latent space, such that well-performing source model can lead to well-performing target model. Following this idea, we propose a novel multi-modal domain adaptation framework as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 The VQA Framework ‣ Open-Ended Visual Question Answering by Multi-Modal Domain Adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

A comparison of the statistics for these datasets are listed in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Datasets ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Open-Ended Visual Question Answering by Multi-Modal Domain Adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which shows that the scale of VizWiz is much smaller in terms of the numbers of images and questions. Although VizWiz has more unique answers, only 824 out of its top 3,000 answers overlap with the top 3,000 answers in VQA 2.0. This explains why models trained on VQA 2.0 perform poorly on VizWiz, and their limited transferability. We find 28.63% of questions in VizWiz are even not answerable due to reasons mentioned before, making the domain gap even more significant.

The results show that the multi-modal MMD brings the most significant performance gain, which validates that aligning on every single modality is beneficial to the transferability of multi-modal tasks.

We experiment with various target sizes of 1/8 (2,500), 1/4 (5,000), 1/2 (10,000) and all data (20,000).

We can observe that with the increase of the amount of training data, the performance gain over fine-tuning is decreasing. We conjecture that this is because when we have limited amount of target data, having more prior knowledge is beneficial to model performance, while having more target data will make prior knowledge less helpful. However, our method can stably improve the performance because it sufficiently makes use of target data and source data. It is more promising that our domain adaptation method using fewer samples can achieve comparable or better performance compared to training from scratch using doubled amount of data (especially when target data is scarce), <em id="S5.SS5.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, our method using 1/4 data (48.93%) outperforms training from scratch using 1/2 data (47.48%).</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a novel supervised multi-modal domain adaptation framework for open-ended visual question answering. Under the framework, we have developed a new method for VQA which can simultaneously learn domain-invariant and downstream-task-discriminative multi-modal feature embedding. We validate our proposed method on two popular VQA benchmark datasets, VQA 2.0 and VizWiz, in both directions of adaptation. The experimental results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>
