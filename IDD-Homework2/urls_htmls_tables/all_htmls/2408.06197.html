<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In sectors such as finance and healthcare, where data governance is subject to rigorous regulatory requirements, the exchange and utilization of data are particularly challenging. Federated Learning (FL) has risen as a pioneering distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across multiple institutions while maintaining data decentralization. This approach inherently heightens data privacy by sharing only model weights, rather than raw data. Despite its advantages, FL is vulnerable to adversarial threats, particularly poisoning attacks during model aggregation, a process typically managed by a central server. To counteract the vulnerabilities of traditional FL frameworks, Byzantine-robust federated learning (BRFL) systems have been introduced, which rely on robust aggregation rules to mitigate the impact of malicious attacks. However, in these systems, neural network models still possess the capacity to inadvertently memorize and potentially expose individual training instances. This presents a significant privacy risk, as attackers could reconstruct private data by leveraging the information contained in the model itself. Existing solutions fall short of providing a viable, privacy-preserving BRFL system that is both completely secure against information leakage and computationally efficient. To address these concerns, we propose Lancelot, an innovative and computationally efficient BRFL framework that employs fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to safeguard against malicious client activities while preserving data privacy. Lancelot features a novel interactive sorting mechanism called <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">masked-based encrypted sorting</span>. This method successfully circumvents the multiplication depth limitations of ciphertext, ensuring zero information leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate cryptographic enhancements, such as Lazy Relinearization and Dynamic Hoisting, alongside GPU hardware acceleration, to achieve a level of computational efficiency that makes Lancelot a viable option for practical implementation. Our extensive testing, which includes medical imaging diagnostics and widely-used public image datasets, demonstrates that Lancelot significantly outperforms existing methods, offering more than a twenty-fold increase in processing speed, all while maintaining data privacy. The Lancelot framework thus stands as a potent solution to the pressing issue of privacy in secure, multi-centric scientific collaborations, paving the way for safer and more efficient federated learning applications.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) techniques have achieved notable success, contingent upon a crucial prerequisite for fully unlocking their potential, enabling the seamless interconnection of vast datasets and ensuring their broad accessibility to researchers. Nevertheless, certain domains, particularly healthcare and finance, grapple with constraints on data sharing owing to regulatory standards and privacy considerations. Consequently, institutions in these sectors are unable to amalgamate and disseminate their data, impeding advancements in research and model development. The potential to share data among institutions while upholding data privacy could lead to the creation of more robust and accurate models. However, due to data sitting across numerous institutions, the task of centralizing and aggregating this information poses a formidable challenge, entangled in legal and regulatory hurdles. Notably, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> imposes stringent limitations on the transference of personal data, including pseudonymized data, across different jurisdictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a novel paradigm to resolve data governance without sharing private data. For instance, FL enables various healthcare providers to collaboratively conduct statistical analyses and develop machine learning models without exchanging the underlying datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Only aggregated results or model updates are transferred, allowing each healthcare provider to define its data governance and maintain control over access to its patient-level data. In this way, each healthcare provider can define its data governance and retain control over access to its patient-level data.
Therefore, FL provides opportunities to utilize large and diverse volumes of data distributed across multiple institutions. These opportunities can aid in developing and validating artificial intelligence algorithms, resulting in more accurate, unbiased, and generalizable clinical recommendations and expediting novel discoveries. Such advancements are particularly crucial in rare diseases or medical conditions, where the number of affected patients within a single institution is often insufficient to identify meaningful statistical patterns with adequate statistical power.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to its distributed pattern, FL is susceptible to adversarial manipulations stemming from malicious clients. These could either be fake clients introduced by an attacker or genuine clients that an attacker has compromised. For instance, malicious clients have the potential to corrupt the global model by contaminating their local training data, a tactic commonly referred to as data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, they could tamper with their local model updates forwarded to the server, a strategy known as local model poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The corruption of the global model can lead to erroneous predictions encompassing a significant number of test examples indiscriminately, a circumstance that has severe ramifications, especially within medical applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Conversely, the compromised model may deliver predictions of attacker-specified target labels for test examples chosen by the attacker. In contrast, the predicted labels for other non-target test examples remain unaltered. Byzantine-Robust FL (BRFL) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> aim to address malicious clients. The objective in this context is to learn an accurate global model even when a bounded number of clients engage in malicious activities. The core concept is to employ Byzantine-robust aggregation rules, primarily comparing the clients’ local model updates and eliminating statistical outliers, e.g., comparing the distance among all weights, before utilizing them for global model updates. For example, BRFL has been deployed in thorax diseases with X-ray and pigmented skin lesions diagnosed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to avoid malicious client attacks and enjoy the benefits of knowing all participants without sharing their raw data.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite receiving commendations for its enhanced privacy protections, primarily attributed to the retention of raw data on the client’s device, BRFL, can not guarantee the level of privacy that is essential for institutions operating within regulatory frameworks. BRFL involves each client disbursing gradient updates to the central server.
This procedure introduces potential vulnerabilities, as deep neural networks harbor the capability to memorize individual training instances, potentially culminating in a comprehensive breach of the client’s privacy. For example, DLG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and IDLG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> showed the possibility of stealing private training data from the shared gradients of other clients. To provide comprehensive privacy protection, more advanced solutions for FL have been proposed, such as Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Multiparty Computation (MPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. These techniques frequently achieve heightened privacy protection at the expense of accuracy or computational efficiency, constraining their applicability.
Existing DP techniques for FL, which obstruct privacy leakage from intermediate data by introducing noise before sharing, often necessitate prohibitive amounts of noise, resulting in inaccurate models. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus on how to set the privacy parameters for DP to provide an acceptable mitigation of inference risks in practical scenarios. Conversely, MPC and FHE are cryptographic frameworks for securely executing computations over private datasets without intermediate leakage.
However, MPC has significant drawbacks, as it incurs considerable network communication overhead and faces substantial challenges when scaling to accommodate a large number of data providers. Compared to DP and MPC, FHE-based BRFL systems offer a promising direction. They avoid inaccurate results and reduce multi-round communications. A vital feature of these systems is that all computations are encrypted, eliminating the need for third-party involvement. However, it should be noted that FHE-based BRFL systems generally incur a significant computational overhead. For example, during a single iteration, the computational delay in the context of semi-homomorphic encryption, which only supports the addition operation, is extended hundreds of times when processing ciphertext compared to plaintext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This significant reduction in computational efficiency is even more evident in the case of FHE.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are mainly two critical challenges to building an FHE-based BRFL system. The first challenge lies in the sorting operation in ciphertext due to the limitation of multiplication depth, which limits the deployment of BRFL aggregation rules. For example, some typical BRFL aggregation rules need to sort the distance according to the model weights, leading to multiple ciphertext comparisons during training. The second challenge is the computation efficiency of ciphertext, e.g., Add and Multiplication operations, resulting in prolonged training duration. In particular, the training time is generally increased thousands of times after adopting FHE. In fact, several open-source software platforms have recently been developed to provide users with streamlined access to FL algorithms, such as FedScale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, Flower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, NVFLARE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. It allows the user to federate any workload, any ML framework, and any programming language. However, none of the existing platforms address the problem of indirect privacy leakages in BRFL. It remains unclear whether these existing solutions can substantially simplify FHE-based BRFL systems compared to more conventional workflows that centralize the data if the local model updates could still be considered personal identifying data.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in this paper, we present Lancelot, a computation-efficient framework for privacy-preserving byzantine-robust federated learning using fully homomorphic encryption. In particular, we propose a novel interactive federated learning paradigm for decentralized collaboration between institutions, enabling high-performance and robust models to train without sacrificing data privacy and less computation efficiency. Lancelot incorporates algorithmic enhancements and hardware acceleration, encompassing optimizations of pair-wise ciphertext multiplication strategies, polynomial matrix multiplication, and complex operation additions. These techniques play a crucial role in the efficient design of Lancelot. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a computation-efficient framework for FL in multi-institutional collaborations that is adapted to heterogeneous data sources; (2) we incorporate FHE into BRFL to achieve rigorous privacy guarantees; (3) we analyze and reduce the computation overhead required to collaborate.</p>

<p id="Sx2.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Lancelot, we conduct experiments on a public image classification benchmark with four datasets. In addition, to verify its practical significance, we also conduct experiments on a medical image diagnosing benchmark with 12 datasets. We select three BRFL algorithms for comparison, e.g., Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

Multi-Krum extends the Krum algorithm to select multiple local model updates rather than one. In Median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the server also sorts the values of each parameter and considers each parameter’s median value in all local model updates. Note that we modify the conventional median method by choosing the median clients according to the distance. The detailed information of the above three methods can be referred to in the Appendix.
In addition, we select vanilla BRFL and OpenFHE for implementations of Krum, Multi-Krum, and Median. In particular, the vanilla BRFL implements these three algorithms in plaintext, and OpenFHE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of typical FHE schemes. All experiments are conducted in LeNet-5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, ResNet-18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, ResNet-34 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and ResNet-50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> models.

<p id="Sx2.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We design and implement the Lancelot using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and 4 * A100 on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS.
Specifically, we allocate one process to manage server tasks, including compromised client selection and model aggregation. For each client, we establish a separate process responsible for local model updates and managing the data migration between CPUs and GPUs. Inter-process communication, executed in Python3, facilitates the interaction between the server and nodes.
The deep learning components of our system are implemented using PyTorch. In all experiments, we use SGD as the optimizer for local updates with a learning rate of 0.001. The local batch size is 32, and the default local epoch is 5. Each round of local training takes several gradient steps equivalent to one epoch over the private data. We limit the maximum global learning round to 200 for the federated learning methods. The model’s performance on the validation set is monitored using accuracy, and the training process is stopped early if the validation accuracy does not improve for eight consecutive epochs. We implement FHE operation using well-designed HE GPU Libraries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
We use the multiplicative depth of 3 for the cryptographic parameters, the scaling factor bit digit of 40, an HE packing batch size of 4096, and a security level of 128 bits as our default HE cryptographic parameters during the evaluation.</p>

Unless specified otherwise, we follow the same setting with the leading results in all models. In particular, we divide our approaches into two categories, including cryptographic optimizations and hardware acceleration. Due to the hardware acceleration approach improvements, we adopt the hardware acceleration approach in algorithmic approaches, e.g., lazy relinearization (LazyRelin), and dynamic hoisting, for further comparison.

As for the hardware acceleration, for example, in the FMNIST dataset, Krum’s hardware acceleration approach contributes to a significant speed-up since polynomial multiplications are data-independent and GPU-friendly operations, as shown in Table <a href="#Sx2.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Image Classification Benchmark ‣ Results ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Generally, after implementing hardware acceleration, Lancelot achieves an over 20-fold speed increase.

A noticeable trend is the decrease in execution time for the ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 models as the packing size expands, but the rate of this increase differs among models and datasets. For instance, the SVHN model on ResNet-50 sees a fairly moderate decrease in time, ranging from <math id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="609.20" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1a"><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">609.20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1b"><cn type="float" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1.1">609.20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.5.m5.1c">609.20</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="443.78" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1a"><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">443.78</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1b"><cn type="float" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1.1">443.78</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.6.m6.1c">443.78</annotation></semantics></math> seconds, as the packing size extends from <math id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2^{13}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1a"><msup id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml"><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.2" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.3" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml">13</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1b"><apply id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.2">2</cn><cn type="integer" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1.1.3">13</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.7.m7.1c">2^{13}</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2^{17}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1a"><msup id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mn id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">17</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1b"><apply id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.2">2</cn><cn type="integer" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1.1.3">17</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx2.SSx4.SSSx4.p1.8.m8.1c">2^{17}</annotation></semantics></math>.

This inconsistency may be attributed to the complexity of the models, the intrinsic characteristics of the datasets, and the efficiency of the FHE packing process. For instance, a potential reason for why the computation time per epoch for deeper models, such as ResNet-34, decreases as the FHE packing size increases could be related to the increased capacity of a single ciphertext to hold more parameters. As the overall number of parameters remains constant and the quantity of ciphertext reduces, our hardware acceleration approach can accelerate the computation of ciphertext more efficiently, leading to a decrease in the overall computation time.</p>

The ChestMNIST, a derivative of the NIH-ChestXray dataset, comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images sourced from 30,805 unique patients. Accompanying these images are 14 disease labels, text-mined to enable the classification and localization of common thorax diseases.

The comparison is conducted over twelve datasets in MedMNIST using various models and under different scenarios (e.g., Krum with 10 clients, Multi-Krum with 50 clients, and Median with 100 clients). Each row represents a different dataset with its particular characteristics, such as data modality, tasks (classes), the number of samples, and the implemented model. For each dataset, the computation times achieved by each of the three methods are recorded. Table <a href="#Sx2.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Results of Medical Diagnosing Benchmark ‣ Medical Image Diagnosing Benchmark ‣ Results ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows that Lancelot significantly reduces computation time while preserving the privacy of medical data across all scenarios. For instance, in the case of Krum with 10 clients, when using the ResNet-34 model on the DermaMNIST dataset, the computation time increases significantly from 26.48 seconds in plaintext to an overwhelming 11545.84 seconds with OpenFHE. However, with Lancelot, the time decreases to 545.12 seconds, which is a 21-fold speed improvement, reducing the complexity from the magnitude of hours to minutes. Across all datasets and models, Lancelot consistently reduces latency compared to other methods and achieves a stable acceleration at a constant multiplicity. The growth in time is only related to the parameter size of the model and the number of clients. This analysis signifies the efficiency of Lancelot in reducing computation time, making it a promising method for robustly aggregating the model with privacy considerations.</p>

<p id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we offer a performance analysis of Lancelot, considering the security levels from both internal and external attack perspectives.
Firstly, Lancelot can defend against the third attack, i.e., label flipping, from malicious clients. To prove this, we conduct an empirical evaluation of several robust algorithms, employing the Lancelot defense mechanism, under adversarial conditions with a Byzantine client ratio of 0.1 across three randomly selected MedMNIST datasets, e.g., Bloodmnist, Pathmnist Dermamnist. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Performance and Security Analysis ‣ Medical Image Diagnosing Benchmark ‣ Results ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the findings reveal that our implementations of Krum, Median, and Multi-Krum algorithms, when integrated with Lancelot, yield convergence performance on par with that of non-secure, plaintext methods, even in the presence of Byzantine attacks. Notably, our approach demonstrates superior accuracy relative to the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> algorithm under similar Byzantine conditions, underscoring that our methodology does not compromise on robustness or inferential precision.</p>

The server, equipped with the evaluation key (<math id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{evk}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝐞𝐯𝐤</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝐞𝐯𝐤</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p2.2.m2.1c">\mathbf{evk}</annotation></semantics></math>), is capable of performing homomorphic computations and receives encrypted models from the clients. Lancelot, however, prevents the server from decrypting these models and extracting any data. Although there is communication between the server and the key generation center to implement the Byzantine-robust aggregation rules, it is important to note that all transmissions are secured with homomorphic encryption. Consequently, from Steps 1 to 8 depicted in Fig. <a href="#Sx2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Overview of Lancelot ‣ Results ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, all information remains encrypted. It is only at Step 9, when the aggregated model is decrypted, that there is a potential risk of privacy breaches. However, empirical evidence demonstrates that Lancelot can effectively safeguard privacy even for decrypted information. In particular, we use Deep Learning Gradient (DLG)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and Iterative Deep Learning Gradient (IDLG)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to attack the FL system. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Performance and Security Analysis ‣ Medical Image Diagnosing Benchmark ‣ Results ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, such attacks aim to reconstruct the images utilizing their gradient knowledge, both with and without Lancelot. We observe that our proposed method ensures data protection without information leakage, as evidenced by the failure to reconstruct the original image. Furthermore, the ownership of the image is hidden under the Lancelot scheme. However, DLG and IDLG attacks without protection can provide recognizable images and work particularly well in a realistic setting.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx5.SSSx3.p3.2" class="ltx_p">To assess the performance of Lancelot under DLG and IDLG attacks, we measure the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) of Mean Square Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Specifically, MSE quantifies pixel-wise differences, but it does not reflect the perceptual quality of an image. Conversely, SSIM and PSNR serve as metrics for assessing the decline in quality of the reconstructed image, addressing the limitations inherent in MSE, albeit not entirely aligning with human perceptual nuances. When implementing our method, we observe that most of the MSE values are concentrated on the right side of the image. This indicates that these values are generally high, suggesting that the original information has not been restored. As an example, the details of the image (Row 4, Column 9), characterized by an MSE value of 36.66, have been reinstated. The corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) stands at 0.13, signifying the infrequency with which partial information restoration can occur.

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FHE has recently attracted much attention in the privacy-preserving Machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) application. In this paper, we demonstrate Lancelot, a computation-efficient privacy-preserving byzantine robust federated learning framework for several complex tasks, including image recognition and biomedical diagnosis. Our solution shows highly promising results for enhancing privacy-preserving federated learning services in a computation-effective and reliable manner, which can have abundant social and health value. Meanwhile, Lancelot represents a novel approach to privacy-preserving BRFL, which combines the strengths of both conventional federated learning approaches and cryptographic frameworks for secure computation. While FHE leverages ciphertexts and increases memory usage, Lancelot efficiently mitigates the computational burdens commonly associated with cryptographic solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We are confident that our proposed method has scalable potential in assisting diagnosis and various other applications, such as stroke rehabilitation and Alzheimer’s disease monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Our study was enabled by the synergistic combination of machine-learning technologies and cryptographic development. Although significant progress in the theory and practice of FHE has been made toward improving efficiency in recent years, FHE-based approaches are believed to have a crucial bottleneck to achieving practical performance, and the cryptographic protocol is still regarded as theoretical. Recently, FHE-based machine-learning approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> have demonstrated the feasibility and scalability of privacy-preserving medical data analysis. We hope our study can provide a reference for developing FHE-based secure approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our work could be extended in several future directions to facilitate the adoption of Lancelot. The first direction is that large-scale deployment of Lancelot would be a challenging yet important milestone for this endeavor, especially in cross-device FL scenarios. Our work demonstrates Lancelot’s applicability on a reliable baseline. It constitutes an essential step towards building trust in our technology and fostering its adoption, thus enabling its use to discover new scientific insights. Next, we will extend the capabilities of Lancelot by developing additional protocols for a broader range of standard analysis tools and ML algorithms in biomedical research. A key step in this direction is to make our implementation of Lancelot easily configurable by practitioners for their applications. Specifically, integrating Lancelot to existing user-friendly platforms such as NVFLARE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to make it widely available would help empower the increasing efforts to scientific discoveries. Lastly, by leveraging the FHE, the ciphertexts expand and cost more memory, but it can further optimize the communication cost from the cryptographic perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, Lancelot provides an initial foundation to establish a secure and privacy-preserving ecosystem between algorithm developers and data owners.</p>

<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Lancelot aims to address the two aforementioned challenges in the FHE-based BRFL system. Firstly, to mitigate the constraints imposed by the limited multiplication depth in FHE, we introduce a masked-based encrypted sorting method, which leverages interactive protocols to perform sorting operations efficiently and securely rather than relying on direct encrypted sorting.
Secondly, to reduce computational overhead, we employ a combination of two cryptographic optimizations alongside hardware acceleration, both of which synergize to expedite the entire training process. The organization of this section is shown as follows. We first outline the preliminaries of Lancelot. Next, we illustrate the implementation of masked-based encrypted sorting. Finally, we introduce the specific cryptographic optimizations and hardware acceleration techniques utilized in our system.</p>

The malicious clients may keep their toxic data but can not access the local data of other honest clients. Both honest and malicious clients can get the decrypted global model, yet local model updates uploaded by a single honest client cannot be observed. Note that
malicious clients can launch either targeted attacks or untargeted attacks. Malicious clients can redirect the global model in the wrong direction, impairing the efforts of honest clients.
In addition, due to the inefficient computation of HE-based for the training phase, the goal of Lancelot is to minimize the training cost, i.e., training time, and keep the same accuracy performance as the original model, which can be formulated as follows.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The threat model of this work is listed as follows. Key Generation Center acts as a trusted third party. The server is defined as an honest but curious entity with high computation capability. This characterization implies that while the server faithfully executes established protocols, it may be interested in extracting sensitive information. Our analysis further bifurcates clients into two distinct categories. The first category comprises honest clients who endeavor to enhance the global model. They do so by uploading genuine gradients, which have been trained on their local datasets. Conversely, the second category encapsulates malicious clients. These entities deliberately upload gradients designed to degrade the accuracy of the global model. Their intent is to sabotage the effectiveness of the model, thereby posing a significant challenge in maintaining model integrity. The potential threats caused by the above entities are shown as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The following two threats are from the semi-honest server, i.e.,
<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Data Leakage</span> and <span id="Sx4.SSx1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Inference Attacks.</span> The gradient essentially acts as a map of the client’s local data. Suppose that clients directly upload these plaintext gradients; the clients inadvertently expose pathways for attackers to infer or extract the original data of honest clients, which leads to substantial data leakage, posing a significant risk to client privacy. Meanwhile, in Lancelot, the server and the key generation center exchange certain intermediate results to facilitate the aggregation of local updates. While essential for operation, this process could potentially be exploited to infer sensitive information from these intermediate results, posing a risk to privacy in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, the malicious clients also bring the threats, i.e., <span id="Sx4.SSx1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Poisoning Attacks.</span> Malicious clients aim to manipulate the global model’s performance without detection. They can execute poisoning attacks in numerous ways. Notably, through a label-flipping attack, a malicious client can alter data labels and subsequently upload gradients trained on this manipulated data. These tactics pose significant threats to the integrity and reliability of the learning process in FL.</p>

The first is from the client to the server, and the second is from the server to the KGC.
Given that the server operates under a semi-honest model and the KGC is a trusted center, we have devised distinct approaches tailored to their specific characteristics.

To protect the model information, the weight matrix should be encrypted, and we utilize a homomorphic encryption scheme to enable private distance evaluation on the server side.
In detail, we apply CKKS, a ring-variant of HE scheme that allows batching, to enable efficient processing of several computations simultaneously in a single-instruction-multiple-data manner.

<div id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p1.8" class="ltx_p">The CKKS scheme is a prominent word-wise FHE scheme that supports the approximate evaluation of real numbers at a preset precision.
This scheme allows batched computation by pre-splitting the input into different slots and is efficient on some time-consuming operations.
The security of CKKS is based on the hardness of the Ring-Learning with Errors (R-LWE) problem.

<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to execute the byzantine-robust aggregation rules, the server needs to sort the clients according to the corresponding distance. However, given the constraints imposed by the multiplication depth, relying on direct sorting is impractical, especially in large FL systems with lots of clients. This is primarily because sorting algorithms operating in the ciphertext space generally depend on pairwise ciphertext comparisons, which consume multiple levels of multiplication depth.
To address this, we propose masked-based encrypted sorting, and its core concept is to utilize an interactive protocol between the server and the key generation center that securely conveys the index information, ensuring both efficiency and privacy.</p>

Thus, we only need to linearize the summation result, thus reducing the number of relinearization operations to one.
This technique increases the number of additions, which is far less than the overhead of relinearization, resulting in a performance boost. For example, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Sx4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Lazy Relinearization ‣ Methods ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we initially have three ciphertext multiplication and addition operations. In conventional multiplication, these three ciphertexts undergo multiplication and relinearization three times, followed by an add operation. However, with lazy relinearization, the relinearization step is deferred until after the addition operation. Compared to conventional multiplication, lazy relinearization eliminates two relinearization operations, resulting in significant computation time savings.</p>

Meanwhile, since this unfold approach introduces more computation, we utilize the hoisting technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> and reverse the order of automorphism and modulus raising to reduce computation.
The key observation of this technique is that we can reverse the order of the first three steps above without affecting the correctness of the procedure.
In particular, this key changed computational flow is as follows:</p>

Through this, the time-consuming operations of modulus raising up and down are required only once. For instance, we present an illustrative example in Fig. <a href="#Sx4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ Dynamic Hoisting ‣ Methods ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. The computation of the time-consuming components is parallelized (in the light-blue box), which significantly reduces computational overhead. In contrast, traditional methods (in the orange box) necessitate sequentially repeating the same computational procedures multiple times.</p>

It is not practical in real applications due to the memory limitation in heterogeneous devices. Therefore, We devise a dynamic adjusting approach to the unfoldings to balance computation and parallelism better. In this case, instead of unfolding all the iterations, we only grow some of them, which optimizes the overall performance. We formulate this problem as follows.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Lancelot, the primary area of concern has been the server-side homomorphic evaluations of distance matrices, a computationally intense task.
This consumption mainly results from the CKKS homomorphic operations, which inherently possess a robust parallelism.
The computation of matrix elements is independent, allowing for concurrent execution of many operations without synchronization.
Thus, since servers are typically equipped with superior computational capabilities, we utilize GPU acceleration for the server-side homomorphic evaluations.
Each thread is assigned one coefficient of the ring elements for every HE operation executed and then carries out the corresponding computation, ensuring that multiple coefficients are processed simultaneously.
Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive GPU-based implementation to host the entire distance computation on GPU.
This approach necessitates just one data interaction between the CPU and GPU, with all subsequent operations retaining their data in the GPU’s global memory, significantly curtailing IO latency and boosting overall performance. The details of hardware acceleration are presented in Appendix.</p>

<p id="Sx6.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">MedMNIST encompasses a broad range of primary data modalities including, but not limited to, X-ray, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), and electron microscope images, including PathMNIST, ChestMNIST, DermaMNIST, OCTMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BreastMNIST, BloodMNIST, TissueMNIST, OrganAMNIST, OrganCMNIST, OrganSMNIST datasets In particular, PathMNIST can be used to assist in diagnosing colorectal cancer which is a common disease with a variable clinical course. PathMNIST is based on a prior study for predicting survival from colorectal cancer histology slides, providing a dataset of 100,000 non-overlapping image patches from hematoxylin and eosin stained histological images and a test dataset of 7,180 image patches from different clinical centers. The ChestMNIST, a derivative of the NIH-ChestXray dataset, comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images sourced from 30,805 unique patients. Accompanying these images are 14 disease labels, text-mined to enable the classification and localization of common thorax diseases. Based on the HAM10000 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, the DermaMNIST is a voluminous collection of dermatoscopic images from multiple origins, primarily showcasing common pigmented skin lesions. The OCTMNIST dataset, derived from a pre-existing dataset, encapsulates 109,309 valid optical coherence tomography (OCT) images specifically curated for the study of retinal diseases. PneumoniaMNIST includes 5,856 pediatric chest X-Ray images specifically intended to classify pneumonia against normal instances. The RetinaMNIST dataset, based on the DeepDRiD challenge, furnishes a dataset of 1,600 retina fundus images. The primary task associated with this dataset is the ordinal regression for 5-level grading of diabetic retinopathy severity. The BreastMNIST dataset, derived from a collection of 780 breast ultrasound images, is designed to classify breast cancer. BloodMNIST is based on a dataset of individual normal cells obtained from individuals without any infection, hematologic, or oncologic disease and who were free of any pharmacologic treatment at the time of blood collection. The primary objective of this dataset is to recognize different types of normal peripheral blood cells. TissueMNIST leverages the BBBC05134 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> to classify cell types in human kidney tissue. The dataset was segmented from 3 reference tissue specimens and organized into eight categories. To prevent data leakage, in this paper, we follow the official data split and use the same training, validation, and test set in MedMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and for the FL setting, we adopt the same partition.</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We show the structure of the implemented framework in Figure 2 to give a concise overview. In functionality, it consists of two main parts, one serving for pre-computation and the other containing the optimized implementation of the three HE schemes that can be divided into three layers: a math/polynomial layer, an RNS arithmetic layer, and a scheme layer. The basic layer contains the low-level modular operations for both 64-bit and 128-bit
integers, a pseudo-random generator, and polynomial arithmetics. For the integer operations,
we provide well-optimized implementation written in CUDA PTX assembly to minimize
the number of machine instructions and register usage after compiling. Based on this, we implement polynomial arithmetic, such as NWT and FFT, for fast and low-complexity computation. At the middle layer, we implement the sampling and RNS arithmetic modules, of which the operands are polynomials under RNS or double-CRT representation. The sampling module consists of three approaches for sampling polynomial coefficients from ternary, uniform, and centered binomial distributions. The RNS module offers efficient polynomial arithmetics, and we implement common algorithms of both BEHZ- and HPS-type
base conversion. The top layer offers high-level unified implementation of the BGV, BFV and CKKS schemes. For all schemes, our framework supports the following features: (1) both symmetric and asymmetric encryption; (2) homomorphic addition, subtraction and multiplication of two or multiple plaintexts and ciphertexts; (3) in-place holomorphic exponentiation, negation, and rotation of a single ciphertext.</p>

<p id="Sx6.SSx3.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present a summary of the computational model and GPU architecture in Fig. <a href="#Sx6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ CPU-GPU Computation Model and the architecture of GPU ‣ Descriptions of Hardware Acceleration ‣ Appendix ‣ Lancelot: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning within Fully Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. GPU memory is categorized into two types: read-write and read-only. Read-write memory includes Global Memory (GMEM), Shared Memory (SMEM), and the Register File (RF), with access speeds ranging from slow to fast, respectively. Read-only memory encompasses Constant Memory and Texture Memory, both of which can be cached. A CUDA kernel operates on the GPU with many threads running concurrently; these threads are the smallest execution units and are organized into blocks. Each thread has its private RF, while SMEM is shared among all threads within the same block. Both GMEM and read-only memory are accessible to all threads and have the longest lifespan, covering the duration of the entire computational task. During execution, threads are grouped in warps of 32. A Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) accommodates multiple blocks, and within the SM, each Warp Scheduler (WS) manages the warps, executing them sequentially.</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx3.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx3.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a heterogeneous platform equipped with both CPU and GPU, a typical collaborative computing approach involves the CPU managing the execution queue, dispatching kernels to the GPU, and handling data transfers via PCIe before awaiting the return of results from the GPU. An alternative approach utilizes unified memory, merging CPU and GPU memory spaces to obviate the need for data transfers. Despite the ability to prefetch data, this method often falls short in performance. The former approach may lead to redundant data transfers if tasks are interdependent, while the latter suffers from subpar performance despite its prefetching capabilities. To mitigate these issues, fusing data-dependent kernels can somewhat diminish the I/O latency resulting from data transfers and memory access. However, for optimal performance, it’s crucial to avoid excessive fusion that can lead to reduced SM occupancy due to high resource consumption by a block.</p>

Our computational framework is meticulously architected into a hierarchical tri-layered design, encompassing a foundational Basic Polynomial Layer that includes low-level modular operations for 64-bit and 128-bit integers, a pseudo-random number generator, and sophisticated polynomial arithmetic. At the intermediate stratum, the RNS Arithmetic Layer is dedicated to polynomial operations under RNS or double-CRT representations, facilitating efficient computation through modules for sampling and advanced arithmetic. Culminating in the Interface Layer, it offers a high-level, cohesive implementation of complex encryption schemes, such as CKKS. The framework’s integer operations are deftly implemented in CUDA PTX assembly to optimize instruction count and register utilization. This optimization is the bedrock for accelerated polynomial arithmetic using NWT and FFT algorithms. Comprehensive in its capabilities, our framework supports symmetric and asymmetric encryption, homomorphic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication of plaintexts and ciphertexts, as well as in-place homomorphic exponentiation, negation, and rotation of ciphertexts, catering to the nuanced requirements of secure, homomorphic encryptions.</p>

<p id="Sx6.SSx3.SSSx3.p2.3" class="ltx_p">Since we apply the CKKS scheme in Lancelot, we keep the ciphertext under double-CRT representation, there is no need for NWT/INWT transformation before
and after the tensor product. In the tensor product kernel, we account for all potential scenarios, which vary according to the size of the input ciphertexts. The preferred configuration is when each ciphertext comprises two ring elements, as larger sizes lead to increased computational and memory demands. Similar to For our implementation, we employ the Karatsuba algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, to calculate intermediate results of homomorphic multiplication.

The primary advantage of this approach is that it derives the 128-bit product result from two 64-bit CUDA PTX instructions. The Karatsuba method effectively reduces computational overhead by replacing certain 64-bit multiplication instructions with less costly addition and bitwise shift-right operations for each coefficient.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust FL</h4>

<div id="Sx6.SSx4.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance the robustness of FL under malicious client threats, several byzantine-robust FL methods have been proposed such as Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, Multi-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, RFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, Trim-mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, Median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. For example, the Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> algorithm chooses one local update that minimizes the Euclidean distance to all other updates, and the Median method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> calculates the median of all parameters to resist Byzantine attacks.
However, these schemes have limitations on privacy since they analyze and calculate gradients in plaintext, leading to potential privacy leakage. To relieve such information leakage, privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy (DP), Secure multi-party computation (MPC), and homomorphic encryption (HE) are well adopted in byzantine-robust FL. In particular, Some recent work also investigates the problem of maintaining both DP and Byzantine resilience in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. Specifically, DP-RSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> bridges differential privacy and robust stochastic aggregation by sending the element-wise signs of the differences between their local and the global model. The following approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> combines DP-SGD with existing aggregation rules on the noisy gradient. As for adopting MPC to Byzantine-Robust FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, He et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> directly integrate secure computation based on additive secret sharing and a variation of the Krum aggregation protocol. In addition, So et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> developed a similar scheme based on the Multi-Krum aggregation rule. However, they employed verifiable Shamir’s secret sharing and a robust gradient descent approach, enabled by secure computations over the secret shares of the local updates.</p>

FLOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> introduces a Hamming distance-based aggregation method to resist Byzantine attack which is combined with MPC and HE-based protocols to construct efficient privacy-preserving aggregation. PEFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> adopts HE as
the underlying technology and provides the server with a channel to punish poisoners via the effective gradient data extraction of the logarithmic function to resist Byzantine attack.

In FheFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, each user employs a shared secret key to encrypt their model updates using the CKKS scheme and transmits these encrypted updates to the server and the server can aggregate the model updates from all users within the encrypted domain.
BPFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> validates client models with zero-knowledge proofs and uses homomorphic encryption to protect client data privacy to achieve a unified Byzantine-robust FL system. Unfortunately, the aforementioned methods merely consider applying HE on byzantine-robust FL from the computation efficiency perspective.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Accelerations on CKKS</h4>

<div id="Sx6.SSx4.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx4.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several works leverage hardware accelerators to improve the efficiency of FHE schemes such as GPU, FPGAs. In this work, we focus on using GPU to accelerate CKKS due to the wider accessibility and cost-effectiveness.
The acceleration of polynomial arithmetic in CKKS typically involves two primary operations, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT).
Privf <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> provide the first GPU implementation of a
CRT variant of the CKKS scheme and demonstrate how to perform both inference and training on encrypted inputs for text classification. Jung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite> demystified the key operations of CKKS and effectively exploits massive thread-level parallelism to GPUs by applying transposing matrices and pinning data to threads. Soon, Jung et al. in another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite> employed two kernels to accelerate NTT, extending the acceleration to the CKKS scheme with significant parameters. In addition, they identified that the main memory bandwidth bottleneck is a key challenge in accelerating CKKS operations using GPUs.
CARM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> also employed two kernels to accelerate NTT and is the first optimized GPU implementation of FHE schemes designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. In addition, HE-booster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite> presents a systematic acceleration. They propose the local synchronization to allow threads to be executed as early as possible to accelerate NTT. They also propose a scalable partition strategy for multiple GPU, exploiting the tremendous data level parallelism.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Descriptions of Aggregation Rules</h3>

<div id="Sx6.SSx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In non-adversarial environments, a straightforward approach to aggregating local model parameters into global model parameters is simply to take the average <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. However, this simplistic aggregation rule is prone to manipulation in adversarial environments. Specifically, an attacker could arbitrarily manipulate the global model parameters by compromising just a single worker device. Recognizing this vulnerability, the machine learning community has recently developed a variety of aggregation rules designed to maintain robustness in the face of potential Byzantine failures among worker devices. In the following, we will review three of these aggregation rules.</p>

The intuition is rooted in a protective strategy for the global model. Even if the chosen local model is derived from a compromised worker device, the potential negative impact on the overall system is mitigated due to the chosen model’s resemblance to other local models. In particular, the global model update is based on a square distance score.
