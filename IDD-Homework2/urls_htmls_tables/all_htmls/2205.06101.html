<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) is introduced as a promising technique that allows model owners to fully exploit computational resources and bandwidth resources to train the global model. However, due to the high training cost, a single model owner may not be able to deploy HFL.
To address this issue, we develop a smart contract based trust crowdfunding mechanism for HFL, which enables multiple model owners to obtain a crowdfunding model with high social utility for multiple crowdfunding participants.
To ensure the authenticity of the crowdfunding mechanism, we implemented the Vickey-Clark-Croves (VCG) mechanism to encourage all crowdfunding participants and clients to provide realistic bids and offers.
At the same time, in order to ensure guaranteed trustworthiness of crowdfunding and automatic distribution of funds, we develop and implement a smart contract to record the crowdfunding process and training results in the blockchain. We prove that the proposed scheme satisfies the budget balance and participant constraint.
Finally, we implement a prototype of this smart contract on an Ethereoum private chain and evaluate the proposed VCG mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve social utility while ensuring the authenticity and trustworthiness of the crowdfunding process.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, Federated Learning (FL) has been widely applied in industry as a promising distributed learning solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, the bandwidth bottleneck between the client and the central parameter server limits the development of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. To overcome this shortcoming, hierarchical federation learning (HFL) is proposed, aiming to alleviate the bandwidth constraint by reducing the number of communications between the client and the central parameter server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A typical hierarchical federation learning consists of three entities, including model owners, aggregators, and clients. But a single model owner may not be be able to implement the training for a particular model due to lack of resources or profit, e.g., model owners who are limited with capability cannot deploy a global model independently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_indent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To bridge this gap, an intuitive approach to assist these model owners is to establish a mechanism of model crowdfunding, which enable multiple model owners to cooperate and train a shared global model in HFL by aggregating resources and apportioning cost.
Developing a model crowdfunding mechanism for multiple model owners faces two main problems. The first problem stems from <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the fairness of the model bidder and the tenderer</em>.
Furthermore, due to the difference in demand of model among all model owners, the second problem is <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how to determine a model that can maximize the overall utility</em>. Therefore, a mechanism that can obtain the true evaluation from participants, both owners and clients, is needed in order to assess the value of a particular model by comparing the margin between the individual expected utility and cost.
<br class="ltx_break">The fairness problem of the model crowdfunding has been discussed in previous worsk. Lyu <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.,</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> propose a framework of FPPDL to achieve the fairness by sharing gradient among the model owners. However, this method assumes the model is pre-determined. To our best known, this is the first paper discussing the selection of model in FL.
<br class="ltx_break">On the other hand, as far as the truthfulness is concerned, many existed works mainly focus on the honesty of the clients by implementing contract<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, auction<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and game theory<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches will cause monopoly and dishonesty between the model owner and the client due to the unilateral exposure of the information of the client(e.g. the cost, data quality). Consequently, the model owner can exploit all margin utility from FL training by only allocating the payment that can just compensate the cost instead of their true utility. Therefore, the foundation of the truthfulness is based on the equal status of information that no participants have extra knowledge of others’ evaluation of the model, capability of training and so forth.
<br class="ltx_break">In this article, we propose a smart contract based crowdfunding FL architecture to address the above two problems. As Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Smart Contract based Crowdfunding Mechanism for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shown, the target model will be selected from model owners model proposals based on other participants’ assessment to it. The architecture leverage the advantage of the Block chain which protects the privacy and neutrally operate with resources based on the delicate smart contract. The smart contract will blind the privacy among the participants. The smart contract compares the margin utility among all the proposed models according to the claim of value from model owners and the claim of the cost from clients. Furthermore, as a neutral operator, the smart contract can enforce the payment and other procedure during the training. In terms of truthfulness, the application of VCG mechanism enable the system to select the model that can obtain the maximum social utility in this common goods auction scenario. Considering the complexity of the VCG mechanism, the deployment of Hierarchy Federated Learning structure will not only lightens the communication and non-i.i.d problems which previous works have discussed, but also validates the VCG mechanism by limiting the number of the participants from numerous edge devices to countable base stations which significantly reduces the complexity. By combining the advantage of VCG mechanism, smart contract and HFL, the proposed mechanism can achieve the greatest social well-being in this particular circumstance.

Note the idea of cluster in FL is similar to HFL which also clustering the edge devices. Therefore, HFL is a potentially ideal framework to implement the VCG mechanism.

Instead of cooperate with numerous edge devices. HFL establishes countable base stations which are aimed to cluster edge devices. The updates from edge devices are first aggregated to their corresponding base station and ,then, the base stations process the obtained data and upload the local model to the model owner for final aggregation.

Due to the fact that the accuracy owns a close connection to the data quality, the clients can assess the expectation of the reward based on their data quality in order to determine whether to join in the cooperation.

The dishonesty is illustrated by the possibility of the participant claiming a fake value.

Then, we randomly choose a group of true value for each of them as the proposed model assessments. The model auction is conducted under the rule of the proposed VCG mechanism and repeated for 100 round. The utility of participant in each round can be calculated as the margin between the true value and the final payment.

A smart contract is deployed in HCFL to enforce the procedure and preserve the equal statue between the model owners and the base stations. Leveraging the VCG mechanism, the smart contract of HCFL can obtain the honest claim of assessment from both model owner and the base station and, consequently, is able to determine the model that could bring the greatest social utility. We conduct a thorough discussion of the properties of HCFL and implement several simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mechanism which indicates that the HCFL can benefit the participants who are cooperative in this crowdfunding scenario.</p>
