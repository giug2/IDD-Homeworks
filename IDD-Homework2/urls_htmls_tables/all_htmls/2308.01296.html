<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Cloud-edge-device hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has been recently proposed to achieve communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, there exist several critical challenges, such as the single point of failure and potential stragglers in both edge servers and local devices. To resolve these issues, we propose a decentralized and straggler-tolerant blockchain-based HFL (BHFL) framework. Specifically, a Raft-based consortium blockchain is deployed on edge servers to provide a distributed and trusted computing environment for global model aggregation in BHFL. To mitigate the influence of stragglers on learning, we propose a novel aggregation method, <span id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HieAvg</span>, which utilizes the historical weights of stragglers to estimate the missing submissions. Furthermore, we optimize the overall latency of BHFL by jointly considering the constraints of global model convergence and blockchain consensus delay. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation show that our proposed BHFL based on HieAvg can converge in the presence of stragglers, which performs better than the traditional methods even when the loss function is non-convex and the data on local devices are non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID).</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a representative paradigm of distributed machine learning, federated learning (FL) significantly reduces the cost of data transmission and protects data privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In FL, local devices (i.e., FL clients) upload the trained local models to the parameter server (i.e., aggregator) for global model aggregation. However, FL needs multiple rounds of global model aggregation to obtain the optimal model, which not only consumes substantial communication resources of local devices but may cause network congestion and thus long latency of receiving updates at the server. Therefore, communication efficiency becomes one of the major bottlenecks of FL.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) provides a promising solution to the above challenge<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The basic idea is to conduct multiple intermediate aggregations at proxy servers (e.g., edge servers) before global aggregation on the central server. Local devices upload the model updates to a closer proxy server for model aggregation, reducing their communication cost. As demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, HFL can effectively reduce communication latency. Nevertheless, HFL still faces many problems. First, HFL requires a central server for global model aggregation; once this central server is failed, HFL cannot work anymore. In addition, proxy servers in the intermediate layer introduce a new attack surface, where the privacy leakage of local model updates and other malicious attacks (e.g., model poisoning attacks) become severe threats<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, as a distributed ledger technology, has been widely applied to the fields of distributed machine learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Considering that blockchain can establish a decentralized and trustless computing environment, we can similarly implement blockchain on proxy servers to take the place of the central server in HFL so as to reduce the risks of the single point of failure and malicious attacks.
There exist some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> deploying blockchain in HFL to protect the privacy and improve efficiency,
termed blockchain-based HFL (BHFL); but they still rely on the central server to aggregate global models.
Furthermore, applying blockchain on HFL can lead to extra latency during broadcasting, verification, and consensus to generate a new block. Although there is some research that optimizes the latency of BHFL by designing resource allocation mechanisms among devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, it still cannot resolve the influence of blockchain consensus on latency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the latency issue, the challenge of stragglers still remains unaddressed in BHFL. Here the straggler refers to any participant, including local devices and proxy servers, that cannot submit the model updates in time due to insufficient computing resources or unstable network conditions. The communication efficiency would be directly affected by the stragglers, as waiting for updates from all clients can lead to significant time consumption. Besides, in the case of permanent stragglers that never rejoin FL, simply abandoning their updates can lead to poor performance of the global model, especially when the data of local devices are non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The existing studies mitigating the impact of stragglers on FL usually utilize the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coded computing technology</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or manipulate <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">delayed gradients</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The coded computing method requires extra encoding/decoding processes and data transmission, which is not computing or communication efficient to be applied to various deep learning models. The scheme of manipulating delayed gradients can well address stragglers lacking computing power, where they can still submit partial gradients for model aggregation; however, this method cannot deal with stragglers caused by network disconnection or congestion, where the aggregator cannot obtain any data from stragglers within the required time.
In addition to local devices, proxy servers can also become stragglers in HFL due to unexpected connection failures, which cannot be resolved by either of the above methods since proxy servers are not responsible for model training.
Some research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> utilizes the historical updates to predict the missing updates but the estimation bias could be significant.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To fill these gaps, we propose a fully decentralized BHFL framework, which is proven to be convergence-guaranteed even with stragglers existing in local devices and edge servers. Specifically, we deploy a lightweight Raft-based consortium blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> on edge servers to provide a secure and trusted computing environment for HFL.
To address the challenge of stragglers in BHFL, we design a novel aggregation algorithm, named <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hierarchical averaging (HieAvg)</span>, to aggregate model updates submitted from local devices and edge servers at the edge aggregation and global aggregation phases, respectively. The basic idea of HieAvg is to estimate the missing weights with the differences between the historical weights of stragglers, and HieAvg can work well with non-IID data and non-convex loss functions.
Further, to improve the system efficiency of BHFL, we optimize the overall latency of BHFL by balancing the performance of the global model and the time cost of blockchain consensus.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, there are two ways for synchronizing the model updates in HFL so that the edge servers and local devices can get the latest models in the next round, i.e., <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized</span> and <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed</span>. In the centralized method, a cloud server is employed to send the latest global model to the edge servers,
such as the client-edge-cloud framework presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; while in the distributed way, local model updates are directly shared among peering edge servers via broadcasting, and then each server can derive the global model based on the received updates from others.
Though the distributed method can eliminate the single point of failure, broadcasting models among edge servers can be costly in communication resource consumption and latency. </p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve this challenge, blockchain is widely employed to assist in enhancing the efficiency and performance of HFL. In general, two essential requirements have to be satisfied. First, the deployment of blockchain in HFL cannot bring a significant latency increase to the global model convergence, including the latency of computing, communication, and blockchain consensus. Some of the existing studies use computing-intensive blockchain consensus, such as Proof of Work (PoW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and require model sharing among participants before global model aggregation, making the time cost extremely high<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Second, the implemented blockchain system needs to be capable of protecting data privacy, i.e., local model updates and global models, from leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For these considerations, we propose a consortium blockchain based on the Raft consensus protocol<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Since the consortium blockchain only allows authorized nodes to be included, the edge servers in this network can thus be trusted; further, as a leader-based consensus mechanism, Raft has been proven to be efficient and reliable.
The main working process of the Raft-based consortium blockchain in BHFL can be summarized into the following three steps:

The stragglers are BCFL participants that cannot upload models within the required waiting period in both the layers of local devices and edge servers. On the one hand, local devices may not submit model updates to edge servers in time; on the other hand, edge servers may miss the required deadline for submitting edge models. These stragglers can result in long latency for the model training.
In addition to the latency caused by stragglers, the numbers of local devices, edge servers, edge aggregation rounds, and global aggregation rounds, as well as the blockchain consensus process, will influence the total time consumption.</p>

Generally speaking, there are two main parts of HieAvg: the first part is the basic aggregation method when edge servers would like to collect model submissions from all clients no matter whether there is any straggler or not;
and the second is the straggler mitigation method with two steps which will be detailed below.</p>

Since the edge servers have the historical weights of stragglers, we can use those weights to estimate the delayed weights of stragglers.
We have to ensure that the difference between the estimated weights and the real delayed weights is as small as possible.

If there are stragglers, the corresponding edge server and the edge leader will use the estimation method to update the models (Line 4 and Line 9). Please note that this algorithm is used to handle situations where there exist stragglers; while if there are no stragglers, the model updating will be the same as Algorithm 1. Here we can see that the time complexity of HieAvg, including Algorithms 1 and 2, is <math id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{O}(T\times N\times K\times J)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">𝒪</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">T</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1a" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml">K</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1b" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml">J</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3">𝒪</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑇</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑁</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4">𝐾</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5">𝐽</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{O}(T\times N\times K\times J)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for the challenges of stragglers, we can classify the related research into two categories: coded federated learning (CFL)-based and delayed gradient-based. CFL is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to speed up FL running the linear regression task, where the basic idea is that local clients transmit the generated coded data to the central server at the beginning of training and the server can compute the coded gradients to compensate the missing gradients of stragglers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, CodedFedL is designed to mitigate the impact of stragglers on FL that executes linear and non-linear regression. Although CFL performs well in tolerating FL stragglers, it requires extra data transmission and computing, leading to the risk of data privacy leakage and excessive resource consumption. Besides, most CFL-based methods are model-dependent and thus they cannot be generalized to varying deep learning models. As for the method of delayed gradient, AD-SGD is proposed to minimize the difference between the delayed and optimal gradients in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Xu <span id="S7.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> propose the live gradient compensation method to utilize the one-step delayed gradients. However, this kind of method can only deal with the case of stragglers with poor computing power where their partially-trained gradients are still available to the aggregator; while if the stragglers are caused by network connection problems, the server may not get any model updates from the stragglers in that round.
Recently, a memory enhancement approach, named MIFA, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to solve the problem of stragglers by using stragglers’ recently submitted updates to correct their missing updates;
but this approach can lead to significant estimation bias since it only relies on the latest updates which cannot accurately reflect the overall optimization trend.</p>

<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the above shortcomings in the existing methods, we propose a novel aggregation method, HieAvg. It can be easily applied to more common cases of FL with non-IID data and even non-convex loss functions
to solve the problem of stragglers in a cost-efficient manner.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a decentralized BHFL framework and design a novel aggregation algorithm HieAvg to ensure the convergence of BHFL even when there are stragglers in both local devices and edge servers, where the data is non-IID and the loss function can be non-convex. We also optimize the overall latency of BHFL by jointly considering the requirement of global model convergence and blockchain consensus latency. Theoretical analysis for the convergence of HieAvg is provided and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the validity and superiority of our proposed schemes.
In the future, we would like to design incentive and privacy protection mechanisms to further improve the performance of BHFL.</p>
