<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The detection of cyber-attacks in computer networks is a crucial and ongoing research challenge. Machine learning-based attack classification offers a promising solution, as these models can be continuously updated with new data, enhancing the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike binary classification models that simply indicate the presence of an attack, multi-class models can identify specific types of attacks, allowing for more targeted and effective incident responses. However, a significant drawback of these classification models is their sensitivity to imbalanced training data.</p>
<p id="id3.id2" class="ltx_p">Recent advances suggest that generative models can assist in data augmentation, claiming to offer superior solutions for imbalanced datasets. Classical balancing methods, although less novel, also provide potential remedies for this issue. Despite these claims, a comprehensive comparison of these methods within the NIDS domain is lacking. Most existing studies focus narrowly on individual methods, making it difficult to compare results due to varying experimental setups.
To close this gap, we designed a systematic framework to compare classical and generative resampling methods for class balancing across multiple popular classification models in the NIDS domain, evaluated on several NIDS benchmark datasets.</p>
<p id="id4.id3" class="ltx_p">Our experiments indicate that resampling methods for balancing training data do not reliably improve classification performance. Although some instances show performance improvements, the majority of results indicate decreased performance, with no consistent trend in favor of a specific resampling technique enhancing a particular classifier.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cybercrime and its detection and prevention is an ongoing topic of research.
A primary focus of attacks is the computer infrastructure of companies, which can be targeted in various ways.
The ENISA report of 2023 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> identifies key threats such as data theft, ransomware, and threats to system availability, including denial-of-service attacks and malware.
To detect network attacks, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are used to analyze a company’s network traffic and identify malicious activities.
Previous studies have demonstrated the application of machine learning methods for the analysis and extraction of network traffic patterns, as highlighted in the comprehensive review by Salman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we focus on network intrusion detection as a multi-class classification problem, where the classifier must distinguish between different types of attacks.
In contrast to binary classification approaches, which only indicate whether an attack has occurred, a multi-class approach provides specific information about the type of attack, allowing for a tailored response to the specific threat, such as port scans, brute-force attacks or DDoS.
Since attack events are specific, but rare, their recording for benchmark purposes results in unbalanced class distributions. However, many standard multi-class models, such as Decision Trees, are sensitive to the class distribution and deliver low classification performance when trained on imbalanced datasets in other data domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Consequently, multiple ways of handling imbalanced class distributions have been proposed, e.g. classification algorithms specifically for imbalanced learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, weighting schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, cost-sensitive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or resampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which is particularly versatile as it is model-agnostic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Resampling techniques, specifically under- and oversampling, balance the class distribution by drawing samples from the majority classes to match the number of entries in the minority class or vice versa.
To further augment the training data, synthetic resampling methods such as SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> balance the dataset by generating synthetic data. These common approaches might introduce issues in high-dimensional and complex datasets, such as boundary bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and issues related to data-quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> as a linear feature interpolation may not generate valid data points that accurately represent real-world scenarios, potentially leading to reduced classifier performance.
In contrast, conditional generative models such as Variational Autoencoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Generative Adversarial Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and diffusion-based models such as Latent-Diffusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> promise to generate realistic synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, applicable for data augmentation in terms of class balancing.
In particular, some works claim that the tested generative models outperform classical oversampling techniques in terms of augmentation performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, one work on systematic evaluation of classical resampling techniques in the NetFlow domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> reports mixed results and emphasizes that none of the tested techniques reliably improves classification performance and can even decrease the performance of classifiers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the domain of NIDS, existing studies either evaluate classical over- and undersampling methods without including modern generative models for data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, or they conduct individual comparisons of generative models focusing solely on augmentation without incorporating classical sampling and cleaning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, the lack of standardization leads to individual generative models being tested on different datasets, each with distinct NetFlow features, which complicates direct comparisons of data generation approaches.
Often, approaches are evaluated on a single dataset, raising questions about the generalizability of the results to other datasets.
Furthermore, the arbitrarily chosen classifier models used to evaluate the resampling methods further complicates the overall comparability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address these gaps, our objective is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of modern generative models to improve class balance through data augmentation. We compare these methods with classical (synthetic) oversampling techniques, both independently and in combination with undersampling methods.
Specifically, we construct a testbed of various multi-class classifier models, which are evaluated using established classification metrics on NIDS benchmark datasets. This setup allows us to analyze the effects of both classical and modern resampling methods on different classification models. An overview of our experimental setup is given in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments generally reveal a minor negative impact of most resampling strategies on overall performance and rare classes in particular, while specific classifier-dependent combinations show improvements in classification performance.
This suggests that the arbitrary choice of resampling and augmentation techniques is not a reliable method for improving multi-class classification performance on NIDS data. Instead, this choice should be considered as hyperparameter and optimized separately for each specific classifier.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various approaches for synthetic NetFlow generation and synthetic balancing can be found in literature.
Guo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> use a Conditional GAN model to generate synthetic network data for oversampling on a single dataset called ISCXVPN2016 for multi-class classification. Their goal is to use synthetic data for oversampling minority classes, thereby enhancing the performance of classification models.
The setup of resampling methods consists of five traditional oversampling methods, namely Random Oversampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-SVM and SMOTE-TOMEK, which they compare to their CGAN approach.
Only one classifier, the 1D-CNN is used as the classification model in the evaluation, measuring the classification performance via F1-Score and AUC-PR.
The results show that their approach surpasses the other oversampling techniques, but their experiments are executed exclusively on a single dataset and model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> apply a WGAN-GP model for oversampling attack NetFlows. Their approach is tested against other oversampling methods such as SMOTE, ADASYN, K-SMOTE, G-SMOTE, ACGAN-SVM, and GAN in the datasets NSL-KDD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, UNSW-NB15 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and CICIDS-2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
In their experiments they test seven classifiers which are Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors and an Artificial Neural Network.
Their results suggest that the proposed oversampling method can effectively improve the detection performance.
However, all the tested approaches are based on interpolation-based approaches such as SMOTE variants and ADASYN or rely on GANs, allowing for only limited comparison to other state-of-the-art generative methods.
Moreover, their evaluation does not report baseline results of the classifiers when trained without resampled data. Therefore, the actual benefit of resampling remains unclear.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> apply a conditional Variational Autoencoder for oversampling.
In their experiments, they use the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset exclusively and incorporate two neural network models, a 1D-CNN and a GRU Network for attack classification.
Their evaluation features a comparison of the classification performance of the models that are trained on the original data and the oversampled data. They report improved macro F1 scores by around 3% and 5%.
While their work highlights the effect of class balancing in the NIDS domain, their results cannot be generalized since their findings rely on a single dataset and only two classification models.</p>

In their experiments, they use a self collected dataset consisting of video streaming, video conferencing and social media traffic.
They evaluate the generated synthetic data in various aspects, e.g., by statistical and machine learning performance evaluations, network analysis or syntax related checks by parsing via wireshark or tcp-replay.
In their findings, they report that the diffusion model generates high fidelity traffic with a high conformity to protocol specifications.
Moreover, they highlight that their diffusion model demonstrates potential for class balancing.
While their work focused on the generation of pcap traffic, their model is based on a diffusion model, which can be adapted for NetFlow data. We therefore adapt this model and include it in our comparison.</p>

They report that there is no clear winning resampling combination that reliably improves classification performance.
Although their work systematically tests the combination of resampling methods, they only evaluate on one dataset. Moreover, modern resampling techniques based on generative models are not tested alongside the classical approaches.</p>

The model is trained in a self-supervised manner for data reconstruction.
The C-VAE extends this idea by conditioning the latent space on the output.
Instead of assuming a standard Gaussian distribution for the prior of the latent representation, C-VAE uses the input observation to adjust the prior distribution of Gaussian latent variables <math id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q(z\mid x,y)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.3.cmml">q</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.2.cmml">z</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.1.cmml">∣</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.1.1.cmml">x</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.2.2.cmml">y</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3"><times id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.2"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.3">𝑞</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.1">conditional</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.2">𝑧</ci><list id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3.3.1.1.1.3.2"><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.1.1">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.2.2">𝑦</ci></list></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p5.7.m7.3c">q(z\mid x,y)</annotation></semantics></math> and the generation of the output by <math id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p(y\mid x,z)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.3.cmml">p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.2.cmml">y</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.1.cmml">∣</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.1.1.cmml">x</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.2.2.cmml">z</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3"><times id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.2"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.3">𝑝</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.1">conditional</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.2">𝑦</ci><list id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3.3.1.1.1.3.2"><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.1.1">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.2.2">𝑧</ci></list></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p5.8.m8.3c">p(y\mid x,z)</annotation></semantics></math>.

Diffusion-based models recently gained popularity in the image domain through high-quality image generation.
At first, images are compressed in a latent dimension via an encoder model that transforms the pixel space into a lower-dimensional continuous vector representation.
The latent representation can be decoded into the pixel space via a decoder.
Next, noise is added to the latent representation step by step, defined by time steps <math id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p8.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>.
Afterwards, a denoising U-Net neural network is trained to estimate the added noise for each time step <math id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p8.2.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, which can be used to denoise the image.
Eventually, the U-Net learns to denoise the latent representations, which allows to generate plausible data from randomly drawn noise input.
The conditioning, originally driven by a text prompt, directs the diffusion process to generate images according to the specified conditioning.
Our adapted diffusion model is trained on NetFlow data instead of images, and conditioned via class labels to generate class-specific data for oversampling.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we collected the resampling strategies with the best MCC scores for each model and dataset to analyze the total performance gain compared to the baseline reference where no resampling was applied, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.1 Evaluation of the overall classification performance ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The best values for each model and dataset are indicated in bold, while the best overall result for each dataset across all models is highlighted in blue.

In general, models that already achieve high scores can be observed to exhibit minimal improvement. Although one might infer that generative models dominate among the best results, it is important to highlight that our analysis focused exclusively on the top performing outcomes per MCC. This summary does not emphasize the general trend in which the models exhibited a decreased classification performance, as evident in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Evaluation of the overall classification performance ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Another major finding of Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.1 Evaluation of the overall classification performance ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is that the XGBoost model consistently yields the best or second best results among all datasets. This finding aligns with the literature, which indicates that XGBoost achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art models across diverse domains. Our findings suggest that testing different robust classifier models is more effective for achieving good classification results compared to employing different resampling techniques.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we want to further analyze the improvement of the multi-class classification performance for each model.
First, the classification performance per class using the detection rate is analyzed.
The boxplots in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of the classification performance per class ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> show the distribution of detection rates (y-axis) per class (x-axis) among all models and applied resampling combinations.
One can observe classes which can be classified reliably by many models e.g., Class 0 of NF-BoT-IoT. In contrast, classes like Class 3 and 5 of NF-ToN-IoT could not be classified correctly, and resampling did not improve the performance in these cases.
Between these extremes lie classes such as Class 1, 2, and 9 of NF-ToN-IoT, which exhibit a wide range of detection rates.
This suggests a strong influence of resampling for some classifiers,
since e.g. Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of the classification performance per class ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows a wide range of results for the class 9 of NF-ToN-IoT for some classifier models like DTree but not for others like KNN or XGBoost.</p>

Similarly to the findings depicted in the boxplots in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of the classification performance per class ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, certain classes cannot be correctly classified by both the baseline models and the best models optimized by resampling.
Although there are instances of improvements, for example <math id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>NN for NF-ToN-IoT in c1, where the baseline detection rate is strongly improved, these cases are exceptional.
Overall, our analysis suggests that resampling may not reliably enhance classification performance for a given NIDS dataset, although some models benefit from the right choice of resampling techniques.
A notable mention is XGBoost applied to the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset, which performed best with the baseline data distribution across a broad spectrum of classes, although it did not achieve peak performance for each individual detection rate per class.
While Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of the classification performance per class ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> demonstrates that some classes are challenging to classify in most cases, there are notable outliers with high performance, such as class 1 in NF-BoT-IoT or class 4 in NF-ToN-IoT.
Certain resampling methods, such as NM-3, can enhance the performance for smaller, harder-to-classify classes. However, this improvement often comes at the cost of significantly reducing the detection rates for other classes, thereby lowering the overall performance, as also illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Evaluation of the overall classification performance ‣ 4 Results ‣ Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic Preprint; Accepted at Machine Learning for CyberSecurity @ European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Limitations</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we acknowledge the limitations of our systematic evaluation of resampling methods.
Due to the resource-intensive nature of testing multiple resampled training datesets, we selected a set of efficient and established classification models omitting some newer approaches such as E-Graph-Sage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> in favor of XGBoost, which demonstrates comparable classification performance. Also, extensive hyperparameter evaluations per sampling combination could not be conducted due to computational limitations that might be eventually influenced by the change in class distributions. However, we believe that a fixed hyperparameter set per model allows for a fair comparison of the sampling strategies without, for example, changing the model capacity.
There exist other forms of sampling bias, namely temporal bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> which were out of scope of our experimental setup, since the tested datasets do not contain timestamps.
Additionally, in the context of generative models, we had to adapt them to our datasets and therefore could not test the exact same models as they were partially trained on different data such as pcap files.
Lastly, we highlight the need for thorough quality checks on generated data. Our study focused solely on assessing the impact of generated data for data augmentation. However, there are broader concerns regarding the quality of synthetic data, such as the presence of unrealistic data or the potential leakage of original data in synthetic datasets created by models that replicate training data too closely.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work aimed to systematically analyze the influence of resampling methods for class balancing on multi-class classification models.
The review of related works revealed a lack of standardization, which hinders the comparison of resampling approaches.
We compiled a setup of multiple classical and state-of-the-art resampling strategies in conjunction with established multi-class classification models.
Overall, we tested six classification models on 42 resampling combinations using three datasets.
Our assessment of classification performance considers both overall performance and performance per class.
Our results revealed a low positive impact of resampling on overall classification performance.
The majority of resampling strategies had a negative impact on the classification performance across all models, suggesting that arbitrary resampling may not reliably improve multi-class classification performance.
The per-class performance analysis indicated that the classification performance per class generally did not improve, as certain classes could not be classified well even after resampling.
Even the resampling combinations that exhibited the greatest improvements in overall classification performance did not enhance the detection rates of certain rare classes.
In conclusion, our findings suggest prioritizing the testing of different classification models, given the unreliable nature of improvements in resampling performance.
In the future, our aim is to expand our study to include additional datasets and classification models.
Moreover, conducting a data-driven analysis of the augmented datasets, e.g., via a NetFlow evaluation framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is necessary to identify the factors contributing to both improved and diminished classification performances.</p>
