<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, especially latency-sensitive ones, have been significantly increased. So, Cloud computing, as one of the main enablers of the IoT that offers centralized services, cannot solely satisfy the requirements of IoT applications. Edge/Fog computing, as a distributed computing paradigm, processes, and stores IoT data at the edge of the network, offering low latency, reduced network traffic, and higher bandwidth. The Edge/Fog resources are often less powerful compared to Cloud, and IoT data is dispersed among many geo-distributed servers. Hence, Federated Learning (FL), which is a machine learning approach that enables multiple distributed servers to collaborate on building models without exchanging the raw data, is well-suited to Edge/Fog computing environments, where data privacy is of paramount importance. Besides, to manage different FL tasks on Edge/Fog computing environments, a lightweight resource management framework is required to manage different incoming FL tasks while does not incur significant overhead on the system. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a lightweight FL framework, called FLight, to be deployed on a diverse range of devices, ranging from resource-limited Edge/Fog devices to powerful Cloud servers. FLight is implemented based on the FogBus2 framework, which is a containerized distributed resource management framework. Moreover, FLight integrates both synchronous and asynchronous models of FL. Besides, we propose a lightweight heuristic-based worker selection algorithm to select a suitable set of available workers to participate in the training step to obtain higher training time efficiency. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the FLight. The worker selection technique reduces the training time of reaching 80% accuracy by 34% compared to sequential training, while asynchronous one helps to improve synchronous FL training time by 64%.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Machine Learning (ML) applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, decision-making, and recommendation systems have gained significant popularity. An essential factor for the successful development and deployment of ML applications and models is accessing a large amount of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Due to the ever-increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, exploding amounts of data have been continuously being generated from different sources. However, the increasing awareness of data protection and privacy concerns prevent unconstrained data collection and access. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> was introduced in 2018, which regulates and formalizes how organizations should utilize collected data. Similarly, the United States has the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which also legislates practices of using customer data. Also, even in scenarios where data collection is legally permitted, data silo issues still may happen, referring to the cases in which a data repository controlled by a department (e.g., hospitals or organizations) is isolated and incapable of reciprocal operation. Thus, collecting huge amount of raw data from different sources for ML applications and models face an important barrier. Accordingly, a method to access a rich amount of available data in distributed sites while satisfying data access, protection, and privacy constraints is required. Federated Learning (FL) arises as a promising method to train models based on data from different sites while satisfying data protection rules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main idea of FL is to communicate the model weights or parameters rather than the raw data for training models. In FL, models are first trained locally over multiple devices on different sites. Because the data are trained locally, data privacy is protected, and there is no violation of the GDPR or organizations’ rules. After a few epochs of local training performed at different sites, model weights are extracted and transmitted to an aggregation server. Afterward, the aggregation server merges the received weights from different sites using different algorithms to build a more robust model. So, FL can solve the data silo issues by providing access to more data for ML applications and models. FL features not only leads to more robust models but also promise better data security, privacy, and also more efficient data transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid increase in the number of IoT applications and their heterogeneous requirements (such as low latency, high privacy, and geo-distributed coverage) has caused centralized computing solutions, such as Cloud Computing, to fall short in solely providing efficient services for a wide variety of IoT applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Consequently, Edge/Fog computing, as a distributed computing paradigm, has emerged, in which heterogeneous distributed servers in the proximity of end-users process and store the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Since the resources in Edge/Fog computing are often limited compared to the Cloud resources, Edge/Fog servers may require collaboration with other Edge/Fog servers or Cloud resources for the proper execution of diverse IoT applications. In such a distributed computing environment, FL can be appropriately fit due to several reasons. First, Edge/Fog devices have access to the local data of many IoT applications, which can be used to train more powerful models. Second, privacy and data protection can be satisfied using the localized data in the Edge/fog resources. Third, each Edge/Fog resource often does not have sufficient resources and data for the training of powerful models, while using FL, they can share their data and resources to more efficiently train better models. Fourth, the heterogeneous nature of data in different Edge/Fog servers offers more valuable data for training better models. Fifth, FL helps resource-limited Edge/Fog servers, which have higher limitations in terms of resources and/or data, to more frequently update their models based on the model shared by the model aggregation servers. However, the heterogeneity in Edge/Fog computing environments requires further considerations for the successful deployment of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneity among servers participating in FL includes systems’ resources, networking characteristics, available data size, and availability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Different Systems’ resources comprise different CPU frequencies, CPU utilization rates, RAM, and GPU, just to mention a few. These diverse resources result in different required training times for each server to train a fixed amount of epochs with a predefined amount of data. Considering different computing times among various servers participating in FL, fast servers often need to wait for slower servers, which constrains the efficiency of the training model in a distributed manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Different Network characteristics can also influence the deployment of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Because different servers have various networking capabilities (e.g., download and upload speeds, dropout rates), the time required to transmit the common model structure used by FL from an aggregation server to other servers will vary significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In extreme cases, other servers can finish multiple training rounds when a model is transmitted to servers with minimal network capacity. Such heterogeneous characteristics incur slower sites to wait for a long period, which is a waste of resources. Different data sizes for training a model on each server also challenge the FL. A large training data model can produce a much more robust and accurate ML model compared to servers with limited data. Thus, combining models of sites with various amounts of data will underperform compared to only combining models from sites with large amounts of data. However, simply dropping results from sites with limited data failed to explore the potential of all data available. Hence, to successfully conduct FL, it is essential to address the heterogeneity among different participants of the training process. To address these challenges, intelligent decisions about participant selection for each round of training, network allocation for each participant, and merging algorithms should be carefully investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although some works attempt to improve time efficiency or computational energy efficiency based on system statistics, none of them have attempted to integrate asynchronous FL. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, only a few works that optimized the deployment of FL mechanisms provide the source code of their research. Besides, among the studies that offer their source code, it is very difficult to implement new worker selection policies or new models.
To address these challenges and limitations, we propose the containerized FLight framework based on the FogBus2 resource management framework. The main contributions of this paper are:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is an approach to train a shared ML model based on data from multiple parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. A server can take different roles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Firstly, the worker, which is a server that contributes to the FL by training a commonly agreed model by their local data. Secondly, the aggregation server, which is a server collecting model weights from workers and aggregating them via different aggregation algorithms. Lastly, peers refer to servers communicating with each other, while none of them are central aggregation servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL is featured by pushing model parameters periodically between an aggregation server for aggregating model weights and workers. A complete FL process is partitioned into three stages: 1) Connection Establishment, 2) Model Training, and 3) Training Evaluation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. As FL is a collaborative process, the connection needs to be established before the start of FL training. In the connection establishment stage, different servers identify their roles. Also, the common ML model that each server uses for FL is set. The aggregation server sends the description of the ML model to each worker. In the model training stage, the aggregation server selects workers to participate in FL training. This process is referred to as worker selection. Worker selection is a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Intuitively, selecting more workers will allow the FL to access more data, leading to better model performance. However, this means faster workers must wait for slower workers, requiring more training time to reach the desired accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. After worker selection, the aggregation server informs workers to start the FL training. Then, workers download the version of the model that the aggregation server provides. There are two methods to achieve this. One is an aggregation server sending information about the model directly to workers. This method is easy to implement and straightforward. However, this will cause network congestion at the aggregation server point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. At the same time, the worker may not be available to receive the model due to network availability at the time the aggregation server tries to send the model. An alternative method is the aggregation server to push the ML model to a database and provides download credentials to all selected workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Although it is harder to implement, this method is more friendly to workers with various network conditions. This is because workers can download the model at their desired time. At the same time, the aggregation server only needs to communicate with the database instead of multiple workers, which relieves network pressure. After workers finish training for a few epochs, they send the model weights back to the aggregation server. Next, the aggregation server merges received model weights from workers. After the aggregation server finishes averaging, one epoch of FL training is finished. In the training evaluation stage, the aggregation server evaluates the performance of the averaged model to decide whether to repeat the FL training step or not. The evaluation process is usually performed via two methods. The first method is the aggregation server uses locally available data to test the performance of the aggregated model. Alternatively, the aggregation server asks workers to download the latest model, evaluate the model performance locally, and then provides an average accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. If accuracy does not meet the expectation, stages two and three are executed repeatedly.</p>

The combination of points one and two is called synchronous FL and otherwise asynchronous FL. The advantage of synchronous mode is the simplicity of merging algorithms since all worker model weights are based on the same version of aggregation server model weights. In contrast, model weights may be based on different versions of aggregation server weights for asynchronous FL. Thus extra consideration is necessary for the merging algorithms. The advantage of asynchronous FL is time efficiency compared to the synchronous mode since the aggregation server does not have to wait for slower workers before aggregation and to proceed to the next epoch.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Aggregation methods are essential for the successful update of the aggregation server model, affecting the training time required to reach a desirable accuracy that depicts the importance of understanding aggregation algorithms (e.g., federated averaging, linear weighted averaging, polynomial weighted averaging, exponential weighted averaging). Aggregation algorithms that are biased to the response from workers with more training data or newer versions of the aggregation server model diminish the negative effects of less active workers. In contrast, algorithms with little or no bias risk being negatively influenced in terms of aggregated model performance by low-performing workers. Thus, a trade-off between these two kinds of methods is required, and difference aggregation algorithms need to be examined.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Tuning aggregation frequency is a method to adjust the epoch number that workers require to train locally before responding to the aggregation server. First attempts to optimize FL based on system parameters targeted to quantify several system resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The main optimization goal of this work is to achieve maximum accuracy under a fixed resource budget. This is achieved by tuning the frequency of global aggregation. Since the resource budget is fixed, the total training epochs a worker can perform are fixed. Thus, tuning the frequency of global aggregation can also determine the number of aggregations performed. While the evaluation results depict better accuracy by a few percent, there are some drawbacks to such methods. Firstly, the technique failed to consider the asynchronous case, and the budget is calculated as the minimum budget among all workers, which ignores exploring all resources from other workers with more substantial computation power. Secondly, it intends to exhaust all available resources to achieve the best accuracy, resulting in workers with rich resources to calculate for a large number of epochs before responding to the aggregation server, leading to training time inefficiency. Lastly, the technique failed to adaptively adjust based on workers’ performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several research studies in the literature aim at optimizing the worker selection policy. These works intend to improve the energy efficiency or training time of the FL process by selecting appropriate workers to balance resource efficiency and model accuracy. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a heuristic-based worker selection policy. This work converts all quantified workers’ resources to the time required to transmit and train the model. It assumes all workers can only communicate the model sequentially with the aggregation server and set up the total time allowed between each round of aggregation as a variable. Next, the worker selection policy continuously adds a worker to the worker set until the required time to finish training and transmit the model for all workers exceeds the total time allowed for the current round of aggregation. If the model accuracy increases slowly, then the total time allowed for the current epoch increases to allow more workers to participate in FL training. The technique does not support asynchronous mode. Thus, the issue of fast computing workers waiting for slow workers still exists. Also, although the technique assumes all workers communicate the model weights with the aggregation server sequentially, which simplifies the optimization model, it ignores the potential of saving time by transmitting the model in parallel. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> tried to select as many workers as possible within a given resource budget, the <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> used a Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the worker selection process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This work considers the energy cost, which is a trade-off between the maximum number of selected workers against the energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The RL method considers the cost of each step as the total energy consumed by a set of workers to perform the training based on CPU power and the required time for processing. At the same time, the reward is calculated as the accuracy improvement of the aggregated model. The employed RL technique offers an adaptability feature for this work. However, this research only focuses on the trade-off between energy consumption and model accuracy, while time efficiency is not considered. Another similar research considered energy consumption while targeting the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The above-mentioned works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> primarily depend on the resources participating in the FL process by each worker. They generally assume that more workers will allow the model to be exposed to more data; hence, it improves the accuracy of the shared model. In this way, worker selection policies are more biased towards faster workers and assume more epochs of training conducted by faster workers can result in better accuracy compared to fewer epochs of training that slower workers can do. However, another research suggests that the direction of model update gradients indicates the effectiveness and contribution of different workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This technique requests all workers to train for a few epochs and fetch their response rate. Next, the algorithm computes the average model weights in the first round of aggregation. Then, the algorithm compares all model response rates with the averaged model by calculating the norm difference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. A more significant norm difference indicates that the model update direction is different from the majority’s trend, suggesting the corresponding worker has little or no contribution to the overall accuracy. On the other hand, workers with minimum norm difference with the averaged model indicate the model’s effectiveness in improving the accuracy of the FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This technique conducts a worker selection process more biased towards workers with little norm compared to the averaged model. While this technique plan to save time for FL training by reducing training epochs, more training time is required since slower workers will be selected over faster ones if they have less model norm difference. Previous worker selection strategies have the idea of allowing fast computing workers to participate in FL training and then adding slow workers progressively in later rounds. However, this approach has the drawback that slow workers cannot communicate with the aggregation server for a long time and can only participate in the FL in the last few rounds of training. Accordingly, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> considered the time since the last time a worker fetched model weights from the aggregation server and contributed by responding to the updated model. The integrated ranking formula for worker selection considers such time until the last contribution, together with other factors like computation time and energy consumption. Then, the top workers will be selected, leading to the selection of slower workers before faster workers if they have not communicated with the aggregation server for a long time. While the overall time increases in this technique, the convergence rate is faster. However, because selecting too many slow workers can negatively affect the training time, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a worker selection technique through clustering to control the number of slow workers in the FL training.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most recent research attempts to accelerate the FL process by allocating tasks with different workloads to workers with different capacities to allow heterogeneous workers to finish tasks simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, in which the transmission power of workers and aggregation servers are adjusted to allow transmission efficiency. Instead of tuning the transmission rate to achieve the balance of worker time consumption through tuning the bandwidth, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> intends to tune the amount of data utilized by different workers so that slow and fast workers can finish the training simultaneously. The <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed to use the dropout method to achieve similar computation time among workers rather than tuning the amount of data. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed the concept of offloading part of computation tasks to the aggregation server or nearby servers to reduce the burden of slower workers. While this method is more efficient in terms of training time and resource usage, it requires special considerations as the data should be forwarded from the workers to other servers.</p>

However, it is hard to compare these works against each other because reproducing the experimental results is cumbersome due to the difference between their system setup and programming style. Consequently, implementing an FL framework that allows different techniques to be integrated allows a fair comparison for studying the effectiveness of different techniques. Besides, none of the works has studied the asynchronous FL to utilize the full computational capacity of workers. While unselected workers have to wait until the next round of federated worker selection to contribute to the FL training, asynchronous FL permits all workers to participate in FL. This is because asynchronous FL is not concerned about slow workers to keep fast workers waiting. Instead, asynchronous FL can start aggregation when fast workers finish responding with their trained model weights. Also, when slow workers finish training, the aggregation server can merge the results from slow workers. Moreover, the worker selection policy is required to select the most suitable workers for the purpose of FL training.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To implement the FL framework based on system parameters, the above-mentioned system parameters should be provided for the FL on demand. Moreover, the FL framework requires access and manage distributed servers in the environment, which are often highly heterogeneous in terms of hardware, operating systems, and software. Besides, the connection establishment stage of the FL requires various interaction models and online information about the whole system. To satisfy these requirements, the FogBus2 framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> is chosen as the underlying resource management framework.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FogBus2 is a new Python-based framework consisting of five lightweight and containerized modules (called Master, Actor, User, Task Executor, and RemoteLogger) that support centralized, distributed, and hierarchical deployments. To suit different resource management requirements, it offers several mechanisms and associated policies, including registration, profiling, scheduling, scalability, dynamic resource discovery, IoT application integration, database integration, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FogBus2 provides systems parameters required for the FL, such as CPU frequency, RAM, resource utilization, and networking characteristics, just to mention a few, using a profiling module integrated into its main components. It supports on-demand and periodical profiling, which is helpful for asynchronous FL that frequently merges model weights from workers. After each merging, new worker selection can be conducted, resulting in a more frequent worker selection process. Frequent updates about system parameters among workers allow asynchronous FL to update worker selection accordingly. A more dynamic and adaptive worker selection policy results in more time-efficient FL. This suggests that frequent system parameter update is beneficial for more efficient FL practice. Also, systems parameters in the FogBus2 framework are accessible centrally and also in distributed databases, facilitating the process of obtaining system parameters.</p>

The connection establishment process of FL occurs when different participants connect with each other and know their role in the FL framework. This requires network configuration to allow different servers to communicate with each other while message handlers on each server need to forward the message to the FL training agent. Moreover, it requires the participant who starts the FL process to be aware of potentially available computing resources within the network, so it can send initiative commands and invite them to participate in FL. Moreover, it has integrated task allocation policies, allowing all available sites with sufficient computing resources to conduct FL training, which is convenient for testing and verifying FL implementation.</p>

Executors are classes that run FL tasks as functions, where function inputs are users’ inputs stored in a dictionary. The Sensor sub-component is then configured to ask hyperparameters from users for the FL training process. While there can be various hyperparameters specific to different deployed FL algorithms, current hyperparameters collected from users include:
1) The model shared by participants cooperating in the FL training,
2) Total number of aggregations to perform on the aggregation server side,
3) Number of training epochs each worker has to complete before contributing the local model weights to the FL aggregation process,
4) Whether the FL training is conducted synchronously or asynchronously, and
5) The learning rate initially used by different workers to update the model.
When the FL application runs in FogBus2 and all corresponding TaskExecutors are ready, the Sensor sub-component collects those hyperparameters from users. It is the first step of the FL training. Next, different executors will conduct FL training based on hyperparameters.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL implementation, different participants must regularly communicate with each other to transmit messages and model weights. This requires that different TaskExecutors running FL tasks know the IP address and port number of other FL TaskExecutors before FL training starts. In FogBus2, different tasks within an application are linked to each other according to a dependency graph. In the dependency graph, a task may be the parent of one/several tasks and be the child of one/several tasks. Also, results from parents will be forwarded to their children as input to task function calls on children. This feature is used to transmit the IP address and port number between different TaskExecutors of FL. The aggregation server is responsible for starting the FL training process by creating the FL model and calling selected workers to start training. This makes the Executor running the aggregation server know the network address of all other Executors running as workers so that it can send instructions. Other Executors running as workers only need to wait until the aggregation server contacts them, so the network address of the aggregation server is available, and they can send messages back. Thus, the implementation lets the task that operates as the aggregation server be a child task of all other tasks which run as workers. Moreover, the implementation lets the returning results of tasks that run as workers be the network address to which they are listening. These results will be inputs of the task running the aggregation server. In this way, the aggregation server can have the network address of all other workers before FL training starts.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since Executors running as workers need to return the network address to which they are listening, they need to listen to that address. In order to make the Executor aware of the IP address for tasks running FL training, the implementation takes the IP address from the Actor module. The Actor component is responsible for starting the docker container of the TaskExecutor component in place. Thus, the Actor is physically on the same machine as the TaskExecutor, which makes the IP address of the Message Handler sub-component of the Actor module the same as the IP address of the Executor. The implementation adds a tag noting whether input data from users are related to FL or not. When the Actor component calls the TaskExecutor component to start tasks, it will add the IP address of its Message Handler to the input dictionary if the tag indicating tasks are related to FL. Since the Executor running FL tasks needs to communicate with each other regularly, the implementation lets them communicate with a separate port instead of the port used by the Message Handler sub-component to avoid congestion. The port is subject to the port availability of the machine running TaskExecutor. In this way, the TaskExecutor can start the socket server listening on the same IP address and different port compared to the Message Handler of the Actor, initializing it for FL purposes.</p>

FL optimization depends on parameters describing available system resources. Since the Actor initializes the TaskExecutor, the Profiler sub-component within the Actor is physically on the same machine as the Executor sub-component within TaskExecutor. Thus, data from Profiler of Actor also describe available resources for the Executor running FL tasks. The aggregation server is responsible for making optimization decisions, so it requires system parameters from all workers. The FLight implementation uses the property that parent tasks will pass results to child tasks to pass profiling information from worker Executors to the aggregation Executor. This is achieved by adding profiling data to Executor running as worker results if tasks are tagged as relating to FL. The TaskExecutor that runs the aggregation server will then receive the profiling information, which can be exploited to implement different FL optimization mechanisms accordingly.</p>

At the same time, the aggregation server Executor will own the network addresses of socket servers on workers, as well as profiling information describing available computing resources. Then, the aggregation server task call functions from the FL component to define the FL process and execute the training accordingly. It is worth noting that Executors running as workers still are kept alive by holding the socket server on a separate thread after returning the socket server address. This is different from other tasks in FogBus2 that will terminate after returning results for children’s tasks. This is because worker tasks still need to regularly listen to instructions from the aggregation server to perform FL training.</p>

This sub-component is responsible for providing an interface to access and store all kinds of data related to FL training. In FL training, data that needs to be stored includes 1) ML classes, 2) Parameter weights of ML models, 3) Parameter weights of ML models of other participants, and 4) Training Data. These four types of data can be placed in different storage, including RAM, remote repository, database, or files on local storage. However, to write and retrieve data from these storages, different implementations are required. The data warehouse sub-component encapsulates these various implementations. The data warehouse provides the getter and setter functions such that all kinds of data can be accessed by providing a unique ID. Moreover, if data is saved to the warehouse for the first time, the sub-component will return an ID that uniquely identifies that data. When a unique ID is provided to the getter function, the data warehouse uses the ID to retrieve the saved credentials and storage type used to store the data corresponding to the provided ID. Then it will use those credentials to retrieve the actual data. While setters allow data to be stored on a specified type of storage, default storage for ML model weights and training data is set to the local disk.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This design allows extension for different storage types. Defining a new storage type can be done by defining the methods to write and retrieve data and then adding that to the data warehouse. Due to the design that only a unique ID is sufficient to retrieve data, the ML model, which is one type of data, can be referred to only by the ID locally. Referring to a remote ML model needs to specify the network address as well. This gives rise to the idea of the Pointer class, used by FL training participants to identify a model on a remote site uniquely. The Pointer class consists of the data warehouse’s network address and unique ID for it. For example, when the aggregation server asks a remote worker to conduct training, multiple worker network addresses can be saved, and each worker can own several ML models. The aggregation server can provide the address to uniquely identify the worker and the unique ID to identify the model on that worker.</p>

Since FL training involves frequent message communication between different parties, the FL implementation provides its communicator. The FL communicator’s sub-component consists of a socket server, a message converter, a message dispatcher, and handlers. The socket server is a server that listens to incoming messages via a receiver and sends out messages by the sender. All messages that go through the socket server are binary data. The message converter is responsible for converting messages into binary formats so that data can be transmitted between the local message sender and remote message receiver. The message dispatcher uses message types to forward messages to corresponding handlers. There are three handlers in the implementation. Firstly, the relationship handler is responsible for handling incoming requests for establishing an FL relationship. For example, if the aggregation server asks a remote site to be the worker of itself, then the relationship handler on that remote site is responsible for handling related messages. Secondly, training handlers are responsible for handling messages related to FL training. This includes the aggregation server asking a worker to start training, and the worker acknowledges to the server that local training is complete. Lastly, model transmission handlers are responsible for sending a request to fetch the weights of a remote model and send back the credentials required to download the weights.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to note that the weights are not transmitted directly through the socket connection between the message sender and receiver. This is because model weights are large compared to other messages. If weights are sent over the communication channel of FL, other messages have to wait for the weights to finish transmission. This long waiting time influences the time efficiency if the weights are sent over the communication channel of FL. Alternatively, in FLight, when a server receives the request to fetch a local model weight, the server saves the weights to a File Transmission Protocol (FTP) server and sends back a one-time login credential. The remote server fetching the model weights can use the credential to log in to the FTP server and download through FTP.

This sub-component is a minimum set of functions that an ML model requires to define for the training of different participants. All these functions are collected into a single class. Therefore, ML models can override functions to be deployed for FL training. ML APIs are further divided into relationships, training, and transmission APIs.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Relationship APIs are functions to establish a relationship with other models. It includes functions to request remote servers to act as its workers or request being workers of a remote aggregation server. Functions related to relationships first send a message via the communication sub-component, and the relationship handler on other sites will handle the forwarded message. Training APIs are functions related to ML training, including remote and local training functions. Remote training APIs are functions used by aggregation servers to request a remote worker to perform specified rounds of training. Those functions need a pointer class that refers to a remote model as an argument. So the message sender within the FL communication sub-component can use the network address within the pointer to send the message to a remote message receiver, and the handler can use a unique ID within the pointer on the remote side to retrieve the model via getter of the data warehouse module. Local training APIs are functions used to conduct some calculations on a locally stored model. These include functions to conduct training based on available data, which is the same as regular ML training. Moreover, local training APIs include various functions to federate model weights from workers for the aggregation server based on different algorithms. Besides, Model transmission APIs are functions used to transfer model weights between different participants. Fetcher functions are responsible for sending messages requesting remote model weights. After receiving the fetch request, the FTP access generator on the remote side generates a credential that the participant uses to fetch the model and downloads the model weights from the FTP server. The actual download functionality is implemented in the Downloader.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When the aggregation server model receives enough model weights or reaches a time limit, it then aggregates the received model weights. The default implementation of the FLight for synchronous FL waits until a specified amount of model weights are downloaded from workers. The default implementation of FLight for asynchronous FL starts aggregation once it receives any model weights from any worker. Noting that this step does not involve any communication with remote workers since all model weights have been downloaded beforehand. Moreover, during the aggregation process, if some workers respond with their updated model weights, the aggregation server ignores them or keeps those model weights for the next round of aggregation rather than the current aggregation round.</p>

As a result, many slow workers will be selected in early rounds, which is time inefficient. If the ML model uses a pre-trained model, it can bypass the scenario that accuracy differences are too significant in earlier training rounds. However, this limits the types of applicable ML models to those models working with a pre-trained model.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To perform experiments, we have used a Mac Book Pro with 8 ARM-based CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM and a Desktop computer with 8 Core Core i9 CPU and 32 GB of RAM to run four Virtual Machines (VMs). One VM runs the aggregation server model, while the rest of the VMs run worker models. Each VM is allocated 2 GB of RAM, while the CPU core number and base CPU frequency of all VMs are the same. Three VMs evenly distribute all worker models for different numbers of worker models participating in FL. We conduct an FL with only one worker model, which simulates sequential implementation. Afterward, we use FL with 10-worker models and 30-worker models, in which workers are evenly distributed into three different machines. A VM has 3-4 FL worker models when there are 10 models in the FL, or a VM has 10 worker models when there are 30 models in total. For communication, each VM is assigned a separate network address through which different FL and FogBus2 components can communicate.</p>

However, other configurations distribute training data to different worker models. Configurations 2 and 5 indicate the situation where each worker model holds an even amount of training data, while configurations 3 and 6 denote the case that training data is unevenly distributed. The total amount of available data for training among all workers is the same for configurations 1-3 and 4-6. Different amount of training data leads to a different time to complete the training among workers. All the training is conducted asynchronously and synchronously for one hundred epochs. The long training epoch ensures sufficient time for the aggregation server model to achieve potential accuracy under available workers.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL with even data distribution requires less time to reach stable accuracy, meaning faster training at the initial stage. But sequential one eventually reaches a better accuracy. This can be seen from Fig. <a href="#S4.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ IV-B Performance Results ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ III-D3 Estimated required time for training ‣ III-D Worker Selection Algorithm Design ‣ III Flight: A Lightweight FL Framework ‣ II-C FogBus2 Framework ‣ II-B1 Qualitative Comparison ‣ II-B Related Work ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ FLight: A Lightweight Federated Learning Framework in Edge and Fog Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> that the even data distribution line reaches a high accuracy before the sequential training. However, sequential training reaches better results over time. Moreover, as it can be seen from Fig. <a href="#S4.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ IV-B Performance Results ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ III-D3 Estimated required time for training ‣ III-D Worker Selection Algorithm Design ‣ III Flight: A Lightweight FL Framework ‣ II-C FogBus2 Framework ‣ II-B1 Qualitative Comparison ‣ II-B Related Work ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ FLight: A Lightweight Federated Learning Framework in Edge and Fog Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, the time required for sets of workers that have even or uneven amounts of training data to reach stable accuracy is similar.</p>

However, random worker selection requires a longer time to get the same accuracy as sequential.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have designed and implemented a lightweight and containerized framework for FL, called FLight, by extending the FogBus2 framework. FLight enables the integration of new ML models and supports different mechanisms relating to worker selection access control and storage implementation to be extended easily. Moreover, two worker selection algorithms are introduced in this work to improve the training time efficiency. FLight enables easy extension of mechanism related to FL. New ML models can be extended as long as import and export model weights and merging model weights are defined. Moreover, the worker selection strategy can be extended by overriding the worker selection function skeleton, where multiple system parameters relating to available workers are available for different algorithm designs. Also, the flexible storage model design enables the model weights to be stored on different media, which supports deployment on various computing resources. The implementation also supports asynchronous FL. The easy extension and lightweight property of the FLight makes it a good tool for comparing different federated learning mechanism design.
In future works, we plan to integrate other the-state-of-the-art FL optimization mechanisms into the FLight framework. Moreover, the current framework provides the opportunity to integrate other ML techniques in a distributed manner, such as some of the state-of-the-art distributed deep reinforcement learning techniques for dynamic scheduling of resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Also, considering security and privacy perspectives, although FL inherently protects data privacy as data stays locally at its origination, model weights shared to remote sites still can leak information about training data. Thus, extra modification on shared model weights is necessary to prevent any sensitive information regarding training data leaked out through the format of ML model weights. This is important since protecting training data privacy is the key goal of FL which emphasize this feature should be integrated into the Flight framework. Finally, because Flight is a containerized FL framework, one logical step to expand its properties is enabling container orchestration properties for the Flight framework. So, we plan to deploy the Flight on container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes and K3S, to offer higher scalability, automated monitoring, and failure handling for the Flight framework.</p>
