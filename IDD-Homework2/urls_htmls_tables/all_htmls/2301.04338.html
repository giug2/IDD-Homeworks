<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en">Knowledge distillation is the technique of compressing a larger neural network, known as the
teacher, into a smaller neural network, known as the student, while still trying to maintain the performance of the larger neural network as much as possible. Existing methods of knowledge distillation are mostly applicable for classification tasks. Many of them also require access to the data used to train the teacher model. To address the problem of knowledge distillation for regression tasks in the absence of original training data, the existing method uses a generator model trained adversarially against the student model to generate synthetic data to train the student model. In this study, we propose a new synthetic data generation strategy that directly optimizes for a large but bounded difference between the student and teacher model. Our results on benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy allows the student model to learn better and emulate the performance of the teacher model more closely.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the recent decade, advances in algorithms, computational hardware and data availability have enabled significant developments in artificial neural networks and deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lecun et al., 2015</a>]</cite>. Neural networks models are now state-of-the-art in many fields of application including computer vision (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx32" title="" class="ltx_ref">O’Mahony et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chai et al., 2021</a>]</cite>, natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx31" title="" class="ltx_ref">Otter et al., 2021</a>]</cite>, and signal processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Purwins et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx34" title="" class="ltx_ref">Rim et al., 2020</a>]</cite>. However, as models become increasingly larger in size measured by number of parameters, they too become computationally expensive to store and perform inference on. Large neural networks can be unusable for real world deployment scenarios where hardware may be limited, such as on mobile devices or microcontrollers, or when deployed for as a service to a large number of users such as web applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cheng et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Deng et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al., 2022</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge distillation is a class of method to address this problem by distilling the predictive capabilities of a larger neural network into a smaller neural network, allowing for faster inference and lower memory requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Gou et al., 2021</a>]</cite>. There have been several knowledge distillation methods proposed in the past, typically requiring the original data that was used to train the teacher model. However, in many real-world applications, the original data may not be available for performing knowledge distillation to student models due to reasons such as data size and data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Gou et al., 2021</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with such situations, data-free knowledge distillation methods have been proposed to allow distillation of knowledge without the original training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hu et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lopes et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">Micaelli and Storkey, 2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx49" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ye et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx51" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yoo et al., 2019</a>]</cite>. Data-free knowledge distillation works by generating synthetic data and training the student model with these data and their teacher model predicted labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Much of the existing research for knowledge distillation has been focused on classification tasks. However, regression tasks are common in many engineering applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">Guo et al., 2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx39" title="" class="ltx_ref">Schweidtmann et al., 2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx42" title="" class="ltx_ref">Tapeh and Naser, 2022</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx43" title="" class="ltx_ref">Thai, 2022</a>]</cite> and there are limited methods available on knowledge distillation for regression neural networks. Knowledge distillation for real-world regression applications include lightweight object detectors for remote sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx48" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yang et al., 2022</a>]</cite>, turbine-scale wind power prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen, 2022</a>]</cite>. Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kang and Kang, 2021</a>]</cite> proposed the first data-free knowledge distillation method for regression where a generator model was trained in an adversarial manner to generate synthetic data. Motivated by the need for data-free model distillation on regression models in real world applications, in this work we investigate the behaviors of several synthetic data generation methods including random sampling and adversarial generator.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The main contribution of this paper is to propose an improved method to generate synthetic data for data-free knowledge distillation of regression neural networks. This is achieved by
optimizing for a loss function defined using the student and teacher model predictions directly rather than implicitly through an additional generator model. Compared to existing methods, our synthetic data generation method can provide large difference in prediction between the student and teacher model while mimicking real data better. We demonstrate that this method for synthetic data generation can provide better performance than existing methods through experiments in 7 standard regression datasets, as well as on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset adapted for regression, and a real-world bioinformatics case study of protein solubility prediction. This study contributes in furthering the understanding of data-free distillation for regression and has potential applications in the deployment of distilled models
for many practical regression tasks in various engineering applications.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As neural networks become increasingly large in number of parameters, the deployment of such models faces a difficult challenge for applications such as mobile devices and embedded systems due to limitations in computational resources and memory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cheng et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Deng et al., 2020</a>]</cite>. To address such problems, model compression through knowledge distillation has become an active area of research in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Liu et al., 2022</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx44" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al., 2022</a>]</cite>. Knowledge distillation is the technique where knowledge learned by a larger teacher model is transferred to a smaller student model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Gou et al., 2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hinton et al., 2015</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx45" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang and Yoon, 2022</a>]</cite>. The main idea is that the student model mimics the teacher model to achieve a similar or even a superior performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Various methods of knowledge distillation define and focus on different forms of knowledge. Following the nomenclature in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Gou et al., 2021</a>]</cite>, these can be largely grouped as response-based knowledge, feature-based knowledge, and relation-based knowledge. For response-based knowledge, outputs of the teacher model are used to supervise the training of the student model. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hinton et al., 2015</a>]</cite> uses soft targets from the logits output of the teacher model to train the student. For feature-based knowledge, outputs of intermediate layers, or feature maps learned by the teacher model can be to supervise the training of the student model. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx35" title="" class="ltx_ref">Romero et al., 2014</a>]</cite> trains the student model to match the feature activations of the teacher model. For relationship-based knowledge, the relationships between different layers or data samples are used. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx50" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yim et al., 2017</a>]</cite> uses the inner products between features from two layers to represent the relationship between different layers, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al., 2021</a>]</cite> trains the student model to learn to preserve the similarity of samples’ feature embeddings in the intermediate layers of the teacher models.</p>

The student model is then trained to minimize the difference on these synthetic images. When
applied to image classification datasets (SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets), they were able to train student models with performance close to distillation using actual full training set.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the methods currently existing in knowledge distillation literature deal with classification problems. These methods generally are not immediately applicable to regression problems where the predictions are unbounded real values. For regression problems, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen et al., 2017</a>]</cite> uses a teacher bounded regression loss where the teacher’s predictions serve as an upper bound for the student model instead of using it directly as a target. This method was the first successful application of knowledge distillation to object detection problem and achieved strong results.</p>

This confidence score is then used in the main training task via an attentive imitation loss which adaptively down-weight the loss between the teacher and student model predictions when a particular teacher model’s prediction is not reliable. This method successfully performed knowledge distillation from a deep pose regression network, achieving a student model prediction close to the teacher model while reducing number of parameters by more than 90%.</p>

However in other cases, where the input has been scaled differently, or has clearly defined input space boundaries, it is important to confirm the data distribution and input space boundaries, and design the sampling method such that samples conform to the actual input distribution as much as possible. The input distribution and input space bounds may be defined using the available validation or test set or based upon some prior knowledge. For example, for image input, the value for each pixel is bounded from 0 – 1, and each pixel position may have different value mean and variance. A random sampling strategy in this case could be to draw each pixel from a separate Gaussian distribution with mean and variance computed from the test set, and clipping the value between 0 to 1.</p>

It is not immediately clear whether the generative model is able to learn this inverse function easily. This is because generative adversarial models have been found to be difficult to train well empirically due to many reasons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lucic et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx36" title="" class="ltx_ref">Salimans et al., 2016</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">Saxena and Cao, 2021</a>]</cite>. Many design choices such as the number of training steps of the generator model vis-à-vis training steps of the student model and generator model architecture have large impacts on training stability and model performance and are difficult or tedious to tune. They often also suffer from problems such as mode collapse, and vanished gradients that make the generated synthetic data unsuitable for training the student model.</p>

The performance of the model is measured in mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted value and the actual value of the digit. For e.g. for perfect performance, the model should predict a value of 3.0 for an image with the handwritten digit 3. A prediction of 2.9 will result in a MAE of 0.1.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also want to test how the method can be used when the gradients of the teacher model are not available. For example, many bioinformatics tools such as protein solubility prediction are hosted on servers that allow users to query proteins and obtain predictions. However, both the model and data used to train the model are not available to the user. To recreate the model, data-free knowledge distillation without gradient access to the teacher model is required. If gradient information of the teacher model is unavailable, it is not possible to train the generative network as described in <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="3.2.2 Generator model ‣ 3.2 Synthetic data generation methods ‣ 3 Material and methods ‣ Synthetic data generation method for data-free knowledge distillation in regression neural networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2.2</span></a> directly. However, for direct optimization, it is possible to use metaheuristics optimization that does not require gradients instead of gradient descent.</p>

The input features are the proportion of each of the 20 amino acids within the protein sequence. 2500 proteins are selected for the training set, and the remaining as test set.

<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is observed that direct optimization method with differential evolution outperforms random sampling significantly and approaches the RMSE of the teacher model. This case study demonstrated that direct optimization can be easily and effectively applied to cases where gradient information from teacher model is not available, or if the teacher model is not a differentiable neural network at all, such as the support vector machine teacher model in this case. This is achieved by simply swapping the gradient descent with a metaheuristics algorithm for direct optimization. Whereas, using a conventional neural network generative model for synthetic data generation is not possible as the training for the generative model relies on gradients of both the teacher and student model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The limitation however is that metaheuristics optimization methods tend to be much slower than gradient based optimization and thus incur and significant increase in runtime over the baseline method during training. This may be improved by using a faster metaheuristics algorithm, or one that has been optimized to run on GPU, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we investigated the behavior of various synthetic data generation methods including random sampling and using an adversarially trained generator. We propose a straightforward synthetic data generation strategy that optimizes the difference between the student and teacher model predictions directly, with additional flexibility to incorporate arbitrary regularization terms that capture properties of the data. We show that synthetic data generated by an adversarially trained generator tends not to represent underlying data distribution well, requiring the need to supplement training with random samples and balancing the loss contributions. Our proposed strategy of direct optimization generates synthetic data with higher loss than random samples while deviating less from underlying distribution than the generator method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed method allows the student model to learn better and emulate the performance of the teacher model more closely. This is demonstrated in the experiments, where the proposed method achieves lower RMSE than baseline and generator method for most regression datasets tested. We also demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of the method applied to image inputs and deeper convolutional networks on the MNIST dataset, as well as performing distillation on a non-differentiable model in the case study for predicting protein solubility. Nevertheless, there could be many other applications of data-free knowledge distillation for regression with different input data types that we have not investigated. Future work can be done to investigate the performance of this and previous methods on data types such as signal and time series data which can be useful for deployment on small mobile or microcontroller devices for industrial monitoring applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Kumar et al., 2022</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Lou et al., 2022</a>]</cite>. We have used fixed step gradient descent and differential evolution for direct optimization of student loss. Future work can also explore how different optimizers and their settings may affect performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We hope that this study furthers the understanding of data-free distillation for regression and highlights the key role of the synthetic data generation process in allowing the student model to effectively distill the teacher model.
