<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning scheme that allows multiple data owners to work collaboratively while ensuring data privacy. The success of federated learning depends largely on the participation of data owners. To sustain and encourage data owners’ participation, it is crucial to fairly evaluate the quality of the data provided by the data owners as well as their contribution to the final model and reward them correspondingly. Federated Shapley value, recently proposed by Wang et al. [Federated Learning, 2020], is a measure for data value under the framework of federated learning that satisfies many desired properties for data valuation. However, there are still factors of potential unfairness in the design of federated Shapley value because two data owners with the same local data may not receive the same evaluation. We propose a new measure called completed federated Shapley value to improve the fairness of federated Shapley value. The design depends on completing a matrix consisting of all the possible contributions by different subsets of the data owners. It is shown under mild conditions that this matrix is approximately low-rank by leveraging concepts and tools from optimization. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation verify that the proposed measure does improve fairness in many circumstances.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Building large and powerful machine learning models often needs large amounts of training data. In many industry-scale applications, training data is distributed in the form of silos, that is, training data is obtained and maintained by many data owners instead of being centralized at the place of a single owner or a data center. Because of industrial competition, privacy concerns, legal restrictions, and many other possible reasons, integrating or centralizing data from different sources faces enormous resistance and is often even infeasible. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is promising for training machine learning models on distributed data sources. It facilitates collaboration among a group of data owners (aka. “clients”) and, at the same time, preserves their privacy. The central idea of federated learning is to periodically aggregate local models from clients to produce a more general and capable global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning can be divided into two classes: horizontal federated learning and vertical federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Horizontal federated learning refers to the scenarios where data sets owned by different clients share the same feature space but differ in samples. Vertical federated learning refers to the scenarios where data sets owned by different clients share the same sample IDs, but have different features. In this work, we focus on the horizontal federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The success of federated learning relies on active participation by motivated data owners. The motivation of data owners partially depends on whether the collaboration and rewarding in federated learning are fair. Thus, it is essential to understand how to fairly and efficiently evaluate the contributions of data owners in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we focus on the fairness in contribution valuation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a classical measure originates from cooperative game theory to fairly assess contributions by participants in a coalition.
The Shapley value of a participant is defined as the expectation of the marginal contribution of the participant over all possible subsets of the other participants. Shapley value is the unique measure that satisfies the four fundamental requirements of fairness proposed by Shapley <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>: balance, symmetry, zero element and additivity (see a brief review in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Relaxation of Fairness in Data Valuation in Federated Learning ‣ Improving Fairness for Data Valuation in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>). Although Shapley value has many desirable properties, evaluating Shapley value in federated learning requires exhaustive retraining and evaluating the model on every subset of clients. The costs of communication and time may be prohibitive in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To make fair evaluation of data owners practical in federated learning, some variations inspired by Shapley value were proposed. For example, Wang <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> recently proposed federated Shapley value (FedSV). The key idea is to compute the Shapley values for clients in each round of training and then report the summation over all the rounds as the final results. Compared with the classical Shapley value, FedSV does not require model retraining and retains some but not all of the desirable properties for fairness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, FedSV faces a challenge in large scale federated learning in practice – it may create unfairness. In order to reduce communication costs, many widely used federated learning algorithms in each round select only a subset of clients to upload their local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In the design of FedSV, the unselected clients are assigned with zero credit in that round. This design causes unfairness. One particular example implied by the fundamental requirements of the Shapley fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is that if two clients provide the same data and thus have the identical capability in utility contribution, then they should receive the same rewards. While in the setting of FedSV, clients with the same local data may be assigned with very different credit due to random selection in the training (see an empirical case study in Section <a href="#S7.SS2" title="VII-B Fairness ‣ VII Experiments ‣ Improving Fairness for Data Valuation in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VII-B</span></span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental challenge of fair evaluation of data owners’ contributions in federated learning is that we have to retain fairness in pursuing efficiency. In this paper, we develop a principled approach. The general idea is intuitive and effective. We propose a novel notion of <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">utility matrix</em> consisting of contributions of all possible subsets of the clients over all training rounds. Obviously, with the utility matrix, even FedSV can make a fair evaluation on all clients. However, the utility matrix can only be partially observed because only a subset of clients is selected in each round. The weakness of FedSV is that it computes the Shapley values using only those observed entries in the utility matrix directly. Our idea is try to complete the missing entries of the utility matrix so that the unfairness can thus be eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Completing the unobserved entries is far from trivial. We rigorously show that the utility matrix is approximately low-rank based on a careful theoretical analysis of the similarity between contributions from different clients in successive training rounds. This theoretical insight enables us to estimate the missing entries in the utility matrix using techniques from low-rank matrix completion. With the above insights, we propose a new measure, called <em id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">completed FedSV</em>, to evaluate data owners’ contributions in federated learning.

Ghorbani and Zou <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> pioneered the use of a Shapely value based measure to quantify data contributions in the machine learning context. They proposed a measure called data Shapley value, which can be used to quantify the contribution of a single data point to a learning task. They pointed out that direct computation of data Shapley value needs exponential time complexity and proposed two heuristic approximation methods to improve efficiency.

Theoretically, they proved that their proposed measure is stable in the sense that similar points receive similar values, and similar distributions yield similar value functions. They also provided an algorithm for approximating the distributional Shapley value with a theoretical guarantee on the approximation error.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are also a few data valuation strategies for machine learning and federated learning that do not depend on Shapley value. Koh and Liang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> developed a permutation-based data valuation method for identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. Their method depends on computing influence functions, which is a classic technique from robust statistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Wang <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> brought the similar idea to horizontal federated learning with a different influence function, where the influence of a client is defined as the sum of the influence of the client’s data points. Yoon <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed a reinforcement learning-based method to adaptively learn the contribution of each data point towards the learned predictor model. Zhao <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> recently applied the same technique to federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with Shapley-value-based data valuation techniques, the above mentioned non-Shapley-value-based data valuation techniques are usually more computationally efficient as they require less or even no retraining of models. However, non-Shapley-value-based data valuation techniques usually cannot provide any theoretical guarantee on fairness, which is an important desiderata in data valuation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. This motivates us to develop efficient data valuation techniques for federated learning that retains fairness.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Under the federated learning setting, a utility function is usually defined using the model performance on a test data set. The symmetry requires that the same contributions to the utility should receive the same evaluation, which implies that clients with same local data sets should receive same evaluation. The zero element requires that no contribution, no value is recognized. The additivity requires that if there are multiple tasks and thus multiple test data sets, then the contributions of any client with respect to the test data sets can be expressed as the sum of the contributions with respect to those different tasks and test data sets. It is worth noting that although balance is an important requirement in economics, which guarantees that the payment is fully distributed to all players, it is not relevant in the setting of this paper, since we only care about the relative contributions between clients.</p>

<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">If we run only one round of training and select all clients for that round, then FedSV is equivalent to the classical Shapley value. As mentioned in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ Improving Fairness for Data Valuation in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, more often than not, the central server only selects a subset of clients in each round to reduce communication costs. We argue that simply setting the contribution of an unselected client to zero in a round causes unfairness. One quick example to demonstrate the unfairness is that two clients with the same data may receive quite different evaluations if one of them is unfortunately not selected. We formalize this circumstance in the following observation.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first design a utility matrix consisting of contributions of all subsets of clients over all rounds of training, and present the main theoretical result that the utility matrix is approximately low-rank when the local objectives are Lipschitz continuous and smooth. Then, based on a low-rank matrix completion formulation, we propose a new data evaluation method ComFedSV for federated learning. We also show that when the utility matrix can be well recovered, ComFedSV satisfies certain desirable fairness properties. Last, when the size of the utility matrix is too large, we develop a Monte-Carlo type sampling method to reduce the size of the corresponding matrix completion problem.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Before describing the low-rank matrix completion problem, we need to introduce a natural assumption. Note that if one client never reports its local model to the server,
the central server does not get a chance to observe the possible contribution by the client. Consequently, the contribution of the client cannot be estimated. To tackle this issue, we assume that every client is willing to participate in the federated learning in each round. Therefore, no matter a client is selected by the server in a round, the potential value of the client should be recognized properly. Formally, we have the following assumption.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are different kinds of fairness in machine learning and federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. In this work, we focus on the fairness in data valuation (Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1 (Fairness Guarantee). ‣ VI-D Completed Federated Shapley Value ‣ VI Completed Federated Shapley Value ‣ Improving Fairness for Data Valuation in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Moreover, our proposed metric is adaptable to different training algorithms for federated learning. When there are training algorithms that can achieve some other requirements on fairness besides the ones described in the paper, it is possible to combine those training algorithms with our valuation metric. For example, Chu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm that can guarantee the fairness for protected groups. Our valuation metric ComFedSV can be easily adapted to their algorithm since we still have access to the uploaded local models in each iteration.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of data valuation in horizontal federated learning. We point out the possible unfairness in the existing data valuation method. Then, we propose a new measure ComFedSV, which is not only fair with theoretical guarantee, and also can be evaluated efficiently. We verify the fairness of our measure both theoretically and experimentally.</p>

<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our study advances the frontier in this emerging important direction. There are also many interesting future directions. For example, it is interesting to extend our methodology to vertical federated learning. As another example, under the framework of federated learning, there may exist some other properties needed for fairness in federated learning in addition to those in the Shapley fairness.</p>
