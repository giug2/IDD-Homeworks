<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation is a communication-efficient solution for federated learning (FL). In such a system, iterative procedure is performed: Local gradient of private loss function is updated, amplified and then transmitted by every mobile device; the server receives the aggregated gradient all-at-once, generates and then broadcasts updated model parameters to every mobile device.
In terms of amplification factor selection, most related works suppose the local gradient’s maximal norm always happens although it actually fluctuates over iterations, which may degrade convergence performance. To circumvent this problem, we propose to turn local gradient to be normalized one before amplifying it. Under our proposed method,
when the loss function is smooth, we prove our proposed method can converge to stationary point at sub-linear rate.
In case of smooth and strongly convex loss function, we prove our proposed method can achieve minimal training loss at linear rate with any small positive tolerance. Moreover, a tradeoff between convergence rate and the tolerance is discovered.
To speedup convergence, problems optimizing system parameters are also formulated for above two cases.
Although being non-convex, optimal solution with polynomial complexity of the formulated problems are derived.
Experimental results show our proposed method can outperform benchmark methods on convergence performance.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent decade, intelligent applications are growing rapidly for mobile devices, which will impose a heavy traffic burden on network and lead to privacy leakage when performing model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Federated learning is a new distributed machine learning framework that does not need to bring the raw data of any mobile device to a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, in an FL system, all the involving mobile devices and the central server cooperatively interact over multiple rounds. In each round, every mobile device needs to generate the gradient of local loss function, which is abbreviated as <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local gradient</span>, based on the received public model parameter in the last iteration, and then offloads its local gradient to the central server. Subsequently, the central server aggregates all the received local gradients to produce the public model parameter for the current iteration and then broadcast it to every mobile device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the issue of offloading massive and private raw data has been avoided in an FL system, the aggregation of every mobile device’s local gradients is still a heavy task as they have to be recovered by the central server one-by-one. To be more communication-efficient, the over-the-air computation technique can be adopted, which exploits the signal supposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel and allows simultaneous transmission of every mobile device’s gradient embedding signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In this way, the central server can get the aggregated gradient all-at-once without decoding any specific mobile device’s local gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In an over-the-air computation-aided FL system, the local gradient to be transmitted at every mobile device and the received signal at the central server is usually amplified by an adjustable ratio to overcome the aggregation bias and enhance the training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
However, due to the fluctuation of the local gradient over iterations (as verified in our experiment results) and the limited transmit power of every mobile device, many existing works take the most conservative assumption on the norm of the local gradient by adopting its maximal value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
This will lead to the shrinkage of the signal amplification factor’s feasible region, especially when the local gradient trends to be zero, which would be deleterious for suppressing the training loss.
Some literatures have seen the above limitation and try to flatten local gradient’s norm over iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, only the sign (+1 or -1) of every element of local gradient is transmitted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which promises the transmitted signal before amplification to be with constant amplitude; the local gradient vector is firstly deducted by the vector’s mean and then divided by the vector’s standard deviation before amplification in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which makes the transmitted signal before amplification to be with zero mean and unit variance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With regard to the above two efforts, although the norm of local gradient over iterations has been flattened, the convergence performance of the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> may be degraded due to the great loss of gradient information (which has been verified in experiments of this paper), and the operation of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> cannot guarantee the transmitted signal before amplification to be bounded by some certain value, which still poses uncertainty to the transmitter.
In contrast, we can use another norm flattening method: Normalize the local gradient before amplification, i.e., divide every element of the local gradient vector by its norm. Through this operation, not only the norm of local gradient is fixed at one, but also the absolute value of every element of local gradient is always bounded by one.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, rather than minimizing the MSE of gradient aggregation, the gap to minimal training loss is characterized for the first time when the loss function is smooth only or with strong convexity as well, without adjusting any signal amplification factor.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hereafter, the issue of adjusting signal amplification factor is taken into account in the literature characterizing the gap to minimal training loss, due to the restriction of maximal allowable transmit power of every mobile device and for speeding up convergence, under various scenarios.

Some other works optimize, rather than just select, signal amplification factor so as to achieve better training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.

To overcome this problem,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposes to transmit one-bit information of local gradient, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> uniforms the local gradient vector with its every element subtracted with the vector’s mean and then divided with the its standard deviation.</p>

For case I, a handwritten 10-digit recognition task based on MNIST dataset is performed. The classifier like the one in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is selected, which has three fully connected layers, one ReLU activation layer, and one SoftMax output layer. The loss function in this case is smooth but non-convex.

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a new aggregation method for an over-the-air computation aided FL system, which normalizes the local gradient at every mobile device before amplifying it.
With our proposed method,
stationary point is achieved at a sub-linear rate when the loss function is smooth only, and global optimal solution can be obtained at a linear rate with <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\varepsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ε</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">\varepsilon</annotation></semantics></math>-tolerance when the loss function is not only smooth but also strongly convex, followed by the disclosure of a tradeoff between the convergence rate and the <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\varepsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ε</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝜀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">\varepsilon</annotation></semantics></math>-tolerance.
System parameters are also optimized under the above two considered cases so as to further speedup convergence, both of which correspond to a non-convex problem.
Optimal solution with polynomial complexity for the formulated problems are offered.</p>
