<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers improving wireless communication and computation efficiency in federated learning (FL) via model quantization. In the proposed bitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their local FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which, in turn, aggregates them into a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to jointly determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and the set of devices participating in FL training at each iteration. We pose this as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the training loss of quantized FL under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay requirement. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve without (i) a concrete understanding of how quantization impacts global ML performance and (ii) the ability of the server to construct estimates of this process efficiently. To address the first challenge, we analytically characterize how limited wireless resources and induced quantization errors affect the performance of the proposed FL method. Our results quantify how the improvement of FL training loss between two consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and quantization scheme as well as on several parameters inherent to the model being learned. Then, to address the second challenge, we show that the FL training process can be described as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method to optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL, this model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical characterization of the FL training process to discover an effective device selection and quantization scheme without imposing additional device communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm can reduce the convergence time by 29% and 63% compared to a model free RL method and the standard FL method, respectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging edge computing technology that enables a collection of devices to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without sharing their collected data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. During the FL training process, model parameters are trained locally on the device side and transmitted to a central center (e.g., at a base station (BS) coordinating the process across cellular devices) for global model aggregations. This procedure is repeated across several rounds until achieving an acceptable accuracy of the trained model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The local training and device-server communication processes can each have a significant impact on the performance of FL. These considerations are particularly important in resource-constrained edge settings in which devices exhibit heterogeneity in their communication and computation resources (e.g., a low-cost sensor vs. a high powered drone collecting measurements) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. To minimize the resulting delays due to local training and parameter transmission, one promising method that has been recently proposed is the consideration of machine learning quantization at each device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In such schemes, the training and communication processes operate directly on quantized versions of the learning models, reducing the burden on device resources. However, efficient deployment of quantized FL over wireless networks poses several research challenges, related to the integration of quantization bitwidth considerations with the resulting FL training performance, which we study here.</p>

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> designed a universal vector quantization scheme for FL model transmission to minimize the quantization error. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a heterogeneous quantization framework was proposed for the FL model uploading process to speed up the convergence rate. A robust FL scheme was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to minimize the quantization errors and transmission outage probabilities under constraints on the training latency and device transmission powers.

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed an adaptive quantized gradient method to optimize the number of communication bits employed during the FL iterations so as to reduce communication energy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, an optimal vector quantizer was derived for minimizing the compression error of the local FL model update.

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These prior works on quantized FL have each assumed that certain key parameters of the model being learned – such as smoothness and gradient diversity constants – are known in advance of the training process. Under these assumptions, traditional optimization methods can be used to capture the relationship between quantization error and FL performance so as to find the optimal FL training policy. In practice, these model parameters cannot be obtained by the central server until the FL training process has completed, and thus, the solution derived by these traditional optimization methods may not be appropriate. To address this challenge, one promising approach is to employ reinforcement learning (RL) approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> for enabling the server to estimate these parameters over time through interaction with the devices during the training process, allowing discovery of a more effective FL policy.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a deep multi-agent RL to accelerate FL convergence while reducing the energy used for training.

A deep RL-based framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> was proposed to maximize the long-term FL performance under energy and bandwidth constraints. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the use of a deep Q-network (DQN) to minimize wireless communication interruptions experienced by the FL framework due to device mobility. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> used deep RL to jointly optimize training time and energy consumption via adjusting the CPU-cycle frequency of devices.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the authors employed a multiagent deep RL based quantization method to reduce the energy used for communication in FL framework. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> analyzed the relationship between the global convergence and computational complexity in quantized a federated RL framework.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These prior works have thus employed RL methods to capture the relationship between FL performance and the training policy, in turn leading to improvements in different aspects of model training.

However, due to limited computational and wireless resources, devices may not be able to train and transmit such large sized model parameters (e.g., as in the case of deep learning). To reduce the computation and transmission delays, bitwidth federated learning was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Compared to the widely studied case of federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, the FL model parameters in bitwidth FL are quantized.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the training process, we see that, in bitwidth FL, each device uses a quantized FL model to calculate the training loss and gradient vectors during the training process. Therefore, the quantization scheme in bitwidth FL will affect the resource requirements of FL model training and transmission. This is significantly different from quantization-based FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> that must recover the quantized FL model during the training process, thus introducing additional computational complexity and reducing training efficiency.

First, as the central controller, the server must select a subset of devices to collect their quantized local FL models for aggregating the global FL model. However, each local FL model that is generated by each device depends on the characteristics of the local dataset. Without such information related to the datasets, the server cannot determine the optimal device selection and quantization scheme for minimizing the FL training loss. Second, as the stochastic gradient decent method is adopted to generate each local FL model, the relationship between the training loss and device selection as well as quantization scheme cannot captured by the server via conventional optimization algorithms. This is because the stochastic gradient decent method enables each device to randomly select a subset of data samples in its local dataset for local FL model training, and hence, the server cannot directly optimize the training loss of each device. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model based RL algorithm that enables the server to capture the relationship between the FL training loss and the chosen device selection and quantization scheme.

Compared to traditional model free RL approaches that continuously interacts with edge devices to learn the device selection and quantization schemes, model based RL approaches enable the server to mathematically model the FL training process thus finding the optimal device selection and quantization scheme based on the learned state transition probability matrix. Next, we first introduce the components of the proposed model based RL method. Here, a linear regression method is used to learn the dynamic environment model in RL approach. Then, we explain the process of using the proposed model based RL method to find the global optimal <math id="S3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bm{U}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">𝑼</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.3.m3.1c">{\bm{U}}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{\alpha}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S3.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">𝜶</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝜶</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.4.m4.1c">\bm{\alpha}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.I1.i4.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Here, we need to note that in model free RL algorithms, the server does not know the values of a state transition probability matrix. However, in our work, we analyze the convergence of FL and estimate the FL training parameters in the FL convergence analytical results so as to calculate the state transition probabilities. Using the state transition probability matrix can reduce the interactions between the server and edge devices thus improving the convergence speed of RL.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Sections III. A, B, and C, we proposed a novel model based RL to optimize the device selection and quantization scheme so as to minimize FL training loss. Here, we extend the designed RL for FL with non-convex loss functions. First, we derive the convergence of FL with non-convex loss functions. In particular, we first replace convex Assumptions 2 and 3 with the following conditions:</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we developed a novel quantized FL framework in which distributed wireless devices train and transmit their locally trained FL models to a coordinating server based on variable bitwidths. We formulated an optimization problem that jointly considers the device selection and quantization scheme to minimize FL training loss while accounting for communication and computation heterogeneity across the devices. To solve this problem, we first analytically derived the expected training convergence rate of our quantized FL framework. Our analysis showed how the expected improvement of FL training loss between two adjacent iterations depends on the device selection scheme,
the quantization scheme, and inherent properties of the model being trained. To find the tightest bound, we introduced a linear regression method for estimating these model properties according to observable training information at the server. Given these estimates, the improvement of FL performance at adjacent iterations was described as an MDP. We then proposed a model-based RL method to learn the relationship between FL performance and the choice of device selection and quantization scheme so as to converge on the policy minimizing FL loss. Numerical evaluation on real-world machine learning tasks demonstrated that the proposed methodology yields significant gains in classification accuracy and convergence speed compared to conventional approaches.</p>
