<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Wireless traffic prediction is essential for cellular networks to realize intelligent network operations, such as load-aware resource management and predictive control.
Existing prediction approaches usually adopt centralized training architectures and require the transferring of huge amounts of traffic data, which may raise delay and privacy concerns for certain scenarios.
In this work, we propose a novel wireless traffic prediction framework named <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning</span> (FedDA), by which a high-quality prediction model is trained collaboratively by multiple edge clients.
To simultaneously capture the various wireless traffic patterns and keep raw data locally, FedDA first groups the clients into different clusters by using a small augmentation dataset.
Then, a quasi-global model is trained and shared among clients as prior knowledge, aiming to solve the statistical heterogeneity challenge confronted with federated learning.
To construct the global model, a dual attention scheme is further proposed by aggregating the intra- and inter-cluster models, instead of simply averaging the weights of local models.
We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world wireless traffic datasets and results show that FedDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
The average mean squared error performance gains on the two datasets are up to 10% and 30%, respectively.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the commercialization of fifth generation (5G) communication networks in 2019, the preliminary research on the potential features and enabling technologies for the sixth generation (6G) communications has attracted extensive attention in academia and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">1</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>]</cite>. There are a set of emerging technologies and novel paradigms, e.g., terahertz spectrum, space-air-ground communications, large reflecting surfaces, and cognitive radios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">3</span></a>]</cite>. In addition, the communication research community has nevertheless reached a consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) is the key to implement novel paradigms, coordinate heterogeneous networks, organize various communication resources, and enable the truly smart 6G communications in the 2030s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">4</span></a>]</cite>. In particular, AI aided by big data and high-rate real-time transmission capability is expected to be the most efficient approach to reduce network overhead and elevate the quality of service (QoS) of both access and core networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate the fusion of AI and communication networks, wireless traffic prediction is indispensable.
Wireless traffic prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">6</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>]</cite> estimates traffic data volume in the future and provides the decision basis of communication network management and optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">8</span></a>]</cite>. With the predicted traffic data, proactive measures can be taken to mitigate the network congestion and outage caused by burst transmissions.
Moreover, the heterogeneous service requirements, which are expected to become common in 6G communication networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite>, can be well satisfied with a lower cost by wireless traffic prediction. This will lead to a significant improvement in the QoS from both network’s and user’s perspectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, most of wireless traffic prediction approaches are focusing on centralized learning strategy and involves transferring huge amount of raw data to a datacenter to learn a generalized prediction model. However, frequently transmission of training data and signaling overhead could easily exhaust the network capacity and yield negative impacts on payload transmissions. Thus new wireless traffic prediction approaches that can cope with the above challenges are needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence and success of federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">11</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">12</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">13</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">14</span></a>]</cite> make the prediction problem possible while keep data locally. In FL setting, many clients e.g., mobile devices, base stations (BSs), or companies, collaboratively train a prediction model under the orchestration of a central server. Only intermediate gradients or model parameters obtained by local training are sent to the central server, instead of the raw data. There are enough reasons to support FL in the next-generation communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">15</span></a>]</cite>. First, the advances of edge computing have paved the way for easily implementing FL in reality. As edge clients equip abundant computing resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">16</span></a>]</cite>, the centralized powerful datacenter is no longer essential and the delay of transferring raw data can be considerably reduced. In addition, FL facilitates unprecedented large-scale flexible data collection and model training. The edge clients can proactively collect data during day hours, then jointly update the global model during night hours, to improve efficiency and accuracy for next-day usage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising application prospect, accurate wireless traffic prediction under the FL settings is still a major research challenge, especially the network-wide prediction.
This is because user mobility can cause sophisticated spatio-temporal coupling among wireless traffic, which can hardly be captured and modeled.
Furthermore, different BSs may have distinct traffic patterns which makes the traffic data highly heterogeneous and learning and prediction on this kind of heterogeneous data is very challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to cope with the wireless traffic prediction issues for future communication networks, we propose a novel wireless traffic prediction framework named the dual attention-based federated learning (FedDA), by which a high-quality prediction model is trained collaboratively by multiple BSs. The FedDA framework relies on a set of state-of-the-art training paradigms, including a data augmentation assisted clustering strategy, an intermediate and auxiliary training model, a dual attention-based model aggregation, and a hierarchical aggregation structure.
Specifically, the processing of FedDA can be split into three stages to ensure high-accuracy, transferable, and secure training process for wireless traffic prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We first introduce an augmentation assisted clustering strategy to group all BSs, i.e., clients in the context of FL, into a number of clusters depending on their augmented traffic patterns and geographic locations. Then, leveraging the augmented data collected from distributed BSs, a quasi-global prediction model can be constructed at the central server. This quasi-global model is used to mitigate the generalization difficulty of the global model caused by the statistical heterogeneity among traffic data collected from different clusters. Finally, instead of simply averaging the model weights collected from local clients to yield the global model, a dual attention-based model aggregation mechanism and a hierarchical aggregation structure are adopted at the central server. By introducing the dual attention and hierarchical settings, an adequate equilibrium between generality and specialty can be achieved.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, wireless traffic prediction has received a lot of attention as many tasks in wireless communications require accurate traffic modeling and prediction capabilities.
Wireless traffic prediction is essentially a time series prediction problem. The methods to solve it can be roughly classified into three categories, i.e., simple methods, parametric methods, and non-parametric methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Historical average and naïve methods are representatives of the first category <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">17</span></a>]</cite>. The former predicts all future values as the average of the historical data, while the latter takes the last observation as the future. This kind of prediction method involves no complex computations, and thus makes it quite simple and easy to implement. However, as simple methods fail to capture the hidden patterns of wireless traffic, their prediction performance is relatively poor.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the second category, i.e., parametric methods, the wireless traffic is modeled and predicted based on tools from statistics and probability theory. The most classical method is AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite>.
To characterize the self-similarity and bursty of wireless traffic, ARIMA and its variants were explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite>.
In a recent study, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">21</span></a>]</cite> first decomposed the wireless traffic into regularity and randomness components. Then the authors demonstrated that the regularity component can be predicted through the ARIMA model, but the prediction of random components is impossible.

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As machine learning and AI techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>]</cite> continue their fast evolving, the non-parametric methods have made themselves strong competitors to parametric methods for wireless traffic prediction.
Particularly, recent years have witnessed an obvious trend in solving wireless traffic prediction problems based on deep neural networks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">26</span></a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a deep belief networks-based prediction method for wireless mesh networks.

Aiming to perform prediction on multiple cells, the researcher also introduced a multi-task learning framework by using LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">27</span></a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL provides a distributed training architecture that can be jointly applied with many machine learning algorithms, in particular deep neural networks.
In FL, a global model can be obtained by aggregating local clients’ models. To obtain the global model, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>]</cite> introduced an aggregation method called federated averaging (FedAvg).
Research shows that when the client data is independent and identically distributed (IID), FedAvg achieves similar performance compared with centralized learning. However, when the client data is non-IID, the performance of FedAvg degrades greatly.
To solve this problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">29</span></a>]</cite> proposed a data-sharing strategy by creating a small subset of data which is globally shared among all the client devices. This strategy can solve the statistical heterogeneity challenge confronted with FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">30</span></a>]</cite>, the authors introduced FedProx, which can be viewed as a generalization and re-parameterization of FedAvg, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks.
Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">31</span></a>]</cite> introduced an attentive federated aggregation scheme, called FedAtt, by considering unequal contributions from different clients to the global model. This scheme improves the generalization ability of the global model and has been successfully used to solve the language modeling problem.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, wireless traffic data of different BSs has a high level of heterogeneity and is essentially non-IID.
Performing FL over non-IID data is quite challenging as weight divergence exists when performing model aggregation on the server side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">29</span></a>]</cite>.
Herein, we propose a data sharing strategy by creating a small augmentation dataset using original wireless traffic dataset to conquer the statistical heterogeneity challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our augmentation strategy works as follows. We first split the dataset into weekly slices based on the time index. For the traffic of each week we compute the statistical average value for each time point and treat the obtained result as the augmented data. Finally, the augmented traffic is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.
An illustration of the augmentation procedure is displayed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Wireless Traffic Data Augmentation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2a</span></a>, and the comparison between the augmented wireless traffic and the original traffic can be found in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Wireless Traffic Data Augmentation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2b</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned earlier, spatially distributed BSs have different traffic patterns.
To capture the pattern heterogeneity among BSs and train an accurate prediction model suited for most BSs, we perform clustering analysis for BSs and propose an iterative clustering strategy to achieve this purpose by taking into consideration both the geo-locations and the traffic patterns of BSs.
The detail of our clustering strategy is summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In IV-A Wireless Traffic Data Augmentation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

If the yielded results are not the same, then based on the obtained cluster label on geo-location data, we compute the cluster center and use this to initialize the K-Means clustering on the traffic data.
This indicates that the geo-location information is considered by the traffic pattern clustering process.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most fundamental part of FL is the model aggregation scheme on the central server side, which involves constructing the final global model based on the received local ones.
In this paper, we propose a novel federated optimization strategy, i.e., FedDA, for obtaining the global model.
Specifically, we introduce the attention scheme into model aggregation in FedDA and quantifies the contributions of both local models and the quasi-global model in a layer-wise manner.

Note that we adopt a hierarchical learning scheme in FedDA. That is, there are two levels of model aggregation. The first one performs intra-cluster model aggregation, whose function is to obtain cluster models that capture the unique traffic patterns of each cluster.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.5" class="ltx_p">The purpose of federated optimization on the central server side is to find an optimal global model that can have a strong generalization ability over all BSs.
To achieve this, the global model should find a balance between capturing the unique and the common-shared traffic patterns of BSs.
Thus, in our proposed scheme, we regard the optimization problem as finding a global model that is close to both of the local models and the quasi-global model in the parameter space, considering their different contributions during the model aggregation procedure.
Consequently, the optimization objective is to minimize the sum-weighted distance among different models by using self-adaptive scores as weights.
The federated optimization problem is formally defined as</p>

We begin with a brief introduction of the dataset, evaluation metrics, and baseline methods. Then, experimental settings, such as learning rate and batch size, are given.
After that, we present experimental results, including the overall prediction performance of various methods and the influence of learning (hyper-)parameters on prediction performance.</p>

We can also notice that the prediction performance of FedDA improves consistently with the increase of shared augmentation data size. This is because the quasi-global model can capture the traffic patterns better when more data samples are available.
The success of FedDA can be attributed to the following reasons:</p>

More specifically, the left three subfigures of Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Dual Attention-Based Model Aggregation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a> (Fig. <a href="#S4.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Dual Attention-Based Model Aggregation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>) denote the comparisons between predictions and the ground truth for the SMS, Call, and Internet service traffic of randomly selected cells, and the right three subfigures are the corresponding CDFs of errors.
Here, we choose FedAtt as the benchmark for performance comparison, since it achieves the best performance among all baseline methods in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-C Dual Attention-Based Model Aggregation ‣ IV Proposed Framework ‣ Dual Attention-Based Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.

Meanwhile, it has smaller prediction errors, especially when the traffic volume comes to high and unstable.</p>

In this case, some unique traffic patterns hidden in the data cannot be captured by FedDA and hence leads to performance degradation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigated the wireless traffic prediction problem and proposed a novel framework called FedDA. To deal with the heterogeneity of wireless traffic data, we proposed a data-sharing strategy in FedDA by transferring a small augmented traffic dataset to the central server, by which a quasi-global model is obtained and shared among all BSs. Besides, we also introduced an iterative clustering algorithm to cluster BSs into different groups, by considering both the wireless traffic pattern and the geo-location information. To enhance the generalization ability of the global model, we proposed a dual attention-based model aggregation scheme by paying attention to the unequal contributions of different local models and the quasi-global model. The aggregation scheme is applied over a hierarchical architecture so as to capture both intra-cluster and inter-cluster patterns of wireless data traffic. Finally, we verified the effectiveness and efficiency of FedDA on two real-world datasets.</p>
