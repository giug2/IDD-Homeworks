<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a novel secure and private over-the-air federated learning (SP-OTA-FL) framework is studied where noise is employed to protect data privacy and system security. Specifically, the privacy leakage of user data and the security level of the system are measured by differential privacy (DP) and mean square error security (MSE-security), respectively. To mitigate the impact of noise on learning accuracy, we propose a channel-weighted post-processing (CWPP) mechanism, which assigns a smaller weight to the gradient of the device with poor channel conditions. Furthermore, employing CWPP can avoid the issue that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the overall system is limited by the device with the worst channel condition in aligned over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). We theoretically analyze the effect of noise on privacy and security protection and also illustrate the adverse impact of noise on learning performance by conducting convergence analysis.
Based on these analytical results, we propose device scheduling policies considering privacy and security protection in different cases of channel noise. In particular, we formulate an integer nonlinear fractional programming problem aiming to minimize the negative impact of noise on the learning process. We obtain the closed-form solution to the optimization problem when the model is with high dimension. For the general case, we propose a secure and private algorithm (SPA) based on the branch-and-bound (BnB) method, which can obtain an optimal solution with low complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed CWPP mechanism and the policies for device selection are validated through simulations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The vast amount of valuable data generated at the edge of wireless networks has enabled various artificial intelligence (AI) services for end-users by exploiting deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In most applications, such as the internet of things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or extended reality (XR), data from sensors normally needs to be constantly collected and processed. There are numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been developed to leverage these large-scale datasets. Most of the conventional ML algorithms are centralized, which aggregates all the raw data to a powerful central server where models are trained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, such centralized ML approaches may become increasingly undesirable as privacy concerns and the size of the dataset increase. Specifically, uploading large amounts of raw data from the edge of the network to the centre is generally not feasible due to latency, bandwidth or power constraints and, most importantly, it may directly expose personal information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these challenges, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has been proposed as a privacy-enhancing distributed ML technique, which enables devices to train a model in a decentralized manner with the help of a central controller, such as a base station (BS). Specifically, edge devices firstly download the latest global model parameter from the BS and then compute gradients or update model parameters locally based on local datasets. Then, the gradients or updated model parameters are sent to the BS for the global model update. By training models locally, FL not only makes full use of the computing power of the edge devices, but also effectively reduces the power consumption, latency, and privacy exposure due to the transmission of raw data. In practice, FL as a promising technique has been widely applied to several systems, such as model training in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and content recommendations for smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the high communication efficiency of over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) has been proposed and attracted a great deal of attention. OTA-FL schedules devices concurrently uploading their local models or gradients through a wireless multiple-access channel (MAC). The gradients in prevailing OTA-FL are normally transmitted via an analog transmission. In this way, the BS receives an aggregated gradient or model directly thanks to the waveform-superposition property. The number of dimensions used for transmitting the gradients or models is independent of the number of devices, which makes it highly energy and bandwidth efficient compared with the traditional communication-and-computation separation method, especially when the number of devices is large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL offers basic privacy protection, which benefits from the fact that all raw data is processed locally, it is far from sufficient. On the one hand, some studies revealed that various attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> can infer the individual data or recover part of training data by attacking the exchanged messages, i.e., the gradients and models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This is because the updated model or gradient is obtained based on local data and therefore may contain some information from raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, if the BS is “honest but curious”, it may silently infer the private information from the intermediate gradients or the trained models.
One of the countermeasures to prevent such privacy leakage of FL is differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> which randomizes the disclosed statistics. Some studies focused on differentially private OTA-FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, artificial Gaussian noise was added to each gradient before transmitting if channel noise cannot provide sufficient privacy protection, and a static power allocation scheme was proposed to determine the scale of the artificial noise. Instead of introducing artificial noise, the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a more energy-efficient strategy to guarantee DP by adjusting the transmit power. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> investigated differentially private FL in both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) channels and proposed adaptive power allocation schemes. Nevertheless, similar to the most prevailing OTA-FL studies, all the above works considered an aligned aggregation by controlling transmit power. Although gradient alignment can ensure an unbiased gradient estimation at the BS, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system will be limited to a pretty low level if any device suffers from a poor channel condition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the broadcast nature of wireless channels makes FL vulnerable to security attacks. Although security and privacy are used interchangeably in the existing literature, it is important to highlight the distinction between them. In particular, privacy concerns normally refer to the disclosure of personal information from open access data, while security concerns refer to unauthorised access or alteration of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Eavesdropping on the FL communication channels is often the first step for malicious third parties to launch security attacks. The main difference between eavesdropping attack and privacy issue at the BS is that the BS is authorised to receive the gradients and updated models while the eavesdropper is prohibited. To enhance the security of FL communications, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> adopted a covert communication (CC) technique with which a friendly jammer transmits jamming signals to prevent an eavesdropper from detecting the update transmission of the local model from mobile devices in FL. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> utilized power control to improve the security of FL in the internet of drones (IoD) networks where security rate was employed to measure the security of wireless communications. However, all of these existing works on FL security investigated how digitally coded communication rounds can be protected against eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, the security of analog OTA-FL over a wiretap channel has not yet been considered.</p>

We also conduct the privacy, security and convergence analysis to illustrate the impact of noise on privacy, security protection and learning performance. In addition, we propose different device selection policies for different cases of channel noise. Particularly, we formulate an integer nonlinear fractional optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap while guaranteeing privacy and security in the case of insufficient channel noise. The closed-form solution to the optimization problem is obtained when the model is with high dimension.
Based on the branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm, a secure and private scheduling algorithm (SPA) with low complexity is proposed for the general case.

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We firstly propose a novel SP-OTA-FL framework where noise is employed to protect privacy and security. DP and MSE-security are used to measure the privacy leakage and the security level of the OTA-FL system, respectively. In the proposed framework, a part of the devices are selected as uploaders to participate in the training process and some other devices are selected as jammers to send Gaussian artificial noise aiming at deteriorating the eavesdropper’s SNR so as to guarantee the security of the system and privacy of user data at the BS.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider privacy and security issues together in an FL system. More importantly, this is the first to focus on the security of analog OTA-FL, where gradients are transmitted in an uncoded way and therefore, are more vulnerable to security threats.</p>

The devices and BS communicate through a shared MAC where all devices transmit their gradients simultaneously using the same channel. As a result of the waveform-superposition property of MAC, the gradients are aggregated over the air. Specifically, the BS is assumed to be “honest but curious” that may attempt to learn the personal information from the received gradients, which is regarded as a privacy threat.
Additionally, the security threat is that there is an eavesdropper (Eve) in the system that tries to wiretap the gradients.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To prevent the privacy leakage of user data and the security attack, in the considered system, we employ channel noise and artificial noise as protection in different cases.

However, it may be impractical to perform GD over the whole local dataset because of the considerably massive data samples in reality. Alternatively, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as one of the practical solutions is more widely used in FL as it computes the gradient over a batch of data samples, randomly chosen from the local dataset, as an approximation of the full gradient (obtained based on the whole dataset). The main procedure of basic SGD applied in FL is given as follows:</p>

Additionally, different from the conventional gradient-aligned OTA-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the power allocation in the CWPP scheme does not force gradient alignment. As a result, the overall SNR of the system will not be limited by the device with the worst channel condition.</p>

This validates the trade-off of using noise between achieving privacy and security and guaranteeing learning performance. This is because the devices with the best channel conditions could result in a high risk of privacy leakage and security issue, and therefore are usually not selected as uploaders. Meanwhile, to benefit learning performance, the devices with the worst channel conditions are not usually selected as the uploader either. Inspired by the insight of the closed-form solution, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on BnB, referred to as SPA, to solve Problem <math id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{P1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝐏𝟏</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝐏𝟏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{P1}</annotation></semantics></math>, which can achieve the solution as the same as ESM with lower computational complexity.</p>

It is well known that more participants and less noise distortion can make the model more accurate.
The drawback of Policy-1 is that the number of selected devices to participate in training is less than Policy-2. Due to the introduction of artificial noise, Policy-2 results in more noise distortion in the training process, which makes the model less accurate. As the total number of devices becomes larger, more devices are qualified to be selected as participants in Policy-1 where the noise only contains channel noise. By contrast, although there are more devices selected to participate in training in Policy-2, the power of noise is also bigger than that in Policy-1. Therefore, Policy-1 performs better than Policy-2 in the case when the number of devices is bigger.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance the privacy of user data and the security of the FL system, we have proposed an SP-OTA-FL framework in this work. In the proposed FL system, noise is used to protect both user privacy and system security. Specifically, three cases have been considered. In particular, we have quanitified the privacy leakage of user data using DP, and measured the security of the analog gradient using MSE-security. To reduce the impact of noise on the aggregated gradient, we have proposed a CWPP mechanism, which assigns less weight to badly distorted gradients.
Further, we have conducted the privacy, security and convergence analysis and theoretically characterized the impacts of noise on privacy and security protection as well as the optimality gap. To obtain an appropriate device selection decision, we have analyzed the proposed framework and proposed two policies for device selection when the channel noise is insufficient. In particular, we have formulated an integer fractional optimization problem, which can be solved with low complexity via a BnB-based SPA algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed CWPP and the device selection policies has been validated through simulation.</p>
