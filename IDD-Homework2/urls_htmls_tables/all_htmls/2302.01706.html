<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in tabular data synthesis, under the presumption of direct accessible training data.
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a paradigm which allows to distributedly train machine learning model with clients possessing unique features pertaining to the same individuals, where the tabular data learning is the primary use case. However,
it is unknown if tabular GANs can be learned in VFL. Demand for secure data transfer among clients and GAN during training and data synthesizing poses extra challenge.
Conditional vector for tabular GANs is a valuable tool to control specific features of generated data.
But it contains sensitive information from real data - risking privacy guarantees.
In this paper, we propose GTV, a VFL framework for tabular GANs, whose key components are generator, discriminator and the conditional vector.
GTV proposes an unique distributed training architecture for generator and discriminator to access training data in a privacy-preserving manner.
To accommodate conditional vector into training without privacy leakage, GTV designs a mechanism <span id="id21.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">training-with-shuffling</span> to ensure that no party can reconstruct training data with conditional vector.
We evaluate the effectiveness of GTV in terms of synthetic data quality, and overall training scalability.
Results show that GTV can consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable quality to that generated by centralized GAN algorithm. The difference on machine learning utility can be as low as to 2.7%, even under extremely imbalanced data distributions across clients and different number of clients.

While centrally training GANs requires direct access to all training data, this is not always feasible due to increasing privacy concerns. For example, a regional e-commerce company and a bank may hold different information for the shared customers. Generating a synthetic dataset that combines the bank’s customer income records with the e-commerce company’s purchasing history is crucial for creating more valuable data analysis and other products that rely on this combined synthetic dataset. The bank can build a more robust prediction model for credit rating and the e-commerce company can build a more accurate recommendation system for its customers. The traditional way to produce this combined synthetic dataset requires collecting real data from the bank and e-commerce company to train tabular GANs. However, this process violates privacy regulations, as it involves sharing customers’ personal information across different organizations.
Given this, it is crucial to develop a distributed and privacy-preserving
solution that can generate a comprehensive synthetic dataset without compromising customers’ personal information.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In response to such demand, vertical federated learning (VFL) paradigm emerges. VFL is a distributed framework that allows organizations to collaborate in training machine learning models on decentralized data without sharing real data to each other. In VFL, each client holds a local dataset with unique features pertaining to the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">same</span> individuals. This makes VFL particularly appropriate to various applications with tabular data as opposed to image or audio. For training a prediction model under VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wei et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, each client passes its local data through a bottom model (on the client side) and sends the output to a top model (on the server side) to calculate gradients. This approach ensures that the local data is not directly accessed by any party except the owner, and only intermediate results are shared.
Previous studies of VFL have primarily concentrated on prediction models such as decision tree <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and deep neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Romanini et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>,
there is no platform to train tabular GANs under VFL paradigms.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Training of tabular GANs, e.g., CT-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and CTAB-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, for VFL present multiple challenges.
Firstly, since training data does not reside in a single location, one needs to assure that the synthetic data does not only retain data correlations for the data within one client, but also captures the column dependencies across the data in different clients.
Secondly, many advanced tabular GANs utilize a technique called conditional GAN (CGAN). Assuming there are two types of columns in tabular data: categorical and continuous. The inclusion of a conditional vector (CV) allows for control over the class of generation in certain categorical columns (e.g., indicating ’male’ or ’female’ in <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gender</span> column). This is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced in that column, because after constructing a CV, a corresponding row from the real dataset must also be selected for training data based on the class indicated in the CV. By carefully designing the CV, it is possible to balance the class representations in the training data.
But with the constructed CV,
the indices of the selected training data are available to clients or server. For any party who has the access to both the data indices and CVs, it can potentially reconstruct categorical columns of training dataset from all clients.
Therefore, a privacy-preserving mechanism is needed to accommodate the CV in the GTV training process.
Thirdly, GAN consists of two parts: generator and discriminator, only discriminator needs to access real data.
There is no prior knowledge on whether we should partition both generator and discriminator into top and bottom models
since generator is already isolated from real data. If so, we need to find the optimal partitions so that the final generator can produce high-fidelity synthetic data.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we
present a novel framework – <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GTV</span> which provides an infrastructure to train GANs for <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">G</span>enerating <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>abular data via <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">V</span>ertical federated learning.
GTV partitions both the generator and the discriminator into the top and bottom models to ensure server cannot infer sensitive information from clients’ data.
Unlike the traditional VFL setting for building prediction models which places the server in the client who holds the label column of tabular data,
GTV places the server in a trusted third-party. The reasons are: (1) for training GANs (i.e., a type of generative model), it is not necessary to have a label column in the training data and (2) since the server always has knowledge of the CV, if the server is placed in one of the clients, that client would also have knowledge of the data index for each CV, making it possible to reconstruct data columns of other clients.
However, even if the server does not reside in the client,
it can still reconstruct the categorical columns from training data using the CVs and its corresponding data indices. Data index and CV are like a pair of coordinate, they can indicate a presence of a specific category in a categorical column for a given data index row.
To mitigate this risk, in the end of each training round, GTV implements a mechanism called <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">training-with-shuffling</span> in which all clients shuffle their local data using the same random seed. This ensures that the data after shuffling is still consistent across clients.
The server is isolated from the shuffle function used by clients. This mechanism ensures that the mapping between CV and data index changes each round, making it impossible for server to reconstruct training data of clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We extensively evaluate GTV using nine different partitions of the generator and discriminator neural networks between server and clients, and compare it to a centralized tabular GAN.
The experiments are conducted on five commonly used tabular datasets in machine learning.
We report on the machine learning (ML) utility and statistical similarity difference between the real and synthetic data. Results show that as long as the top model of the discriminator is large enough, GTV performs comparably to the centralized tabular GAN baseline. In the data partition experiments, we discover that the more imbalanced the number of data columns across the clients, the lower the ML utility of the synthetic data. However, by shifting more neural networks of generator from bottom to top model, GTV mitigates the negative effects from this imbalance. Additionally, we find that with increasing number of clients, expanding the size of the generator neural network helps counteract the degradation in synthetic data quality.

It is important to note that in the illustration, the data instances of the clients have been aligned such that each row corresponds to the same individual across all clients. However, in real-world scenarios, it is possible for clients to have instances that are not present in other clients’ data. In this study, we do not address this issue and assume that data alignment can be addressed through the use of the Private Set Intersection technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dong

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of VFL is to train a common machine learning model using the features from all clients.

During the training, each client passes their local data through the bottom model and sends the intermediate logits to the server. In practice, the server is typically managed by the client that holds the label column. As depicted by the dotted line in Fig.<a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1. Vertical Federated Learning ‣ 2. Preliminaries and Motivation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, Bank is the label holder. The server horizontally concatenates the intermediate logits from all the clients and uses the concatenation as input for the top model.
The top and bottom models are then updated using the gradients calculated from the discrepancy between the output of the top model and the label.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A key advantage of using VFL is that it enables the utilization of a larger number of features in machine learning training.
To demonstrate the importance of utilizing all available features in building a machine learning model, we conduct a case study on five tabular datasets: Loan, Adult, Covtype, Intrusion, and Credit. The specific details of the datasets can be found in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1. Experiment Setup ‣ 4. Empirical Evaluation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>.
For this experiment, we use the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lundberg and Lee, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to evaluate the significance of each feature in predicting the target column using a MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) model with one hidden layer containing 100 neurons.
The features are then ranked in descending order of importance and three different settings are considered: (i) Setting-A: the top 10% most important features plus the target column, (ii) Setting-B: all features excluding the top 10% most important ones plus the target column, and (iii) all features plus the target column.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For each dataset, we randomly divide the original dataset into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Then, using the features from the three settings described above, we build a MLP model on the training datasets to predict the target column. The MLP model have the same structure as the one used for calculating the Shapley values. The evaluation results, measured using F1-Score, on the testing datasets for each tabular data are shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2.3. Motivation Case Study ‣ 2. Preliminaries and Motivation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The results indicate that, regardless of the dataset, using Setting-C outperforms Setting-A and Setting-B, indicating that including more features indeed improves the model’s performance in prediction. From the figure, we can also conclude that the importance of features varies among different datasets. For example, for the Credit dataset, using the top 10% or the remaining 90% of the features does not show much difference, whereas the same scenario shows around 20% difference for the Covtype dataset. Additionally, by comparing the results of Setting-A and Setting-B, we can see that one setting is not consistently better than the other, which means that we cannot replace one with the other, and each of them contains important information for target prediction. Therefore, we need VFL to include all available features into the system.</p>

GTV hosts the server by a trusted third-party instead of by a label holder as in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1. Vertical Federated Learning ‣ 2. Preliminaries and Motivation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The reason is twofold: (1) In table synthesis, when label column is not needed, no label holder exists. (2) For privacy reasons, clients should not access both the CVs and selected data indices. The server also should not have access to the <span id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.19.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">shuffle</span> function that the client uses to shuffle local data (we discuss this function in more detail in Section <a href="#S3.SS1.SSS4" title="3.1.4.

Specifically, we assume that the clients and server are honest but curious, meaning that they adhere to the GTV protocol, but may seek to acquire additional information through the computation process. We do not consider collusion between server and clients. Despite the fact that tabular datasets are retained locally within each client, the values derived during the GTV training and synthesizing process may also reveal sensitive information and result in data leakage.</p>

However, this solution has several limitations. Firstly, maintaining P2P connections among all the clients can be costly and insecure, as the number of connections increases exponentially with the number of clients. Additionally, this approach also indirectly leaks clients’ privacy.
To balance the class imbalances in the columns of real data, the CV of CT-GAN is sampled based on the log-frequency of class appearances in the column. As a result, there may be scenarios where several data rows containing the minority class are selected multiple times in one training epoch, often together. In this case, a client who does not contribute CV in the current training round could reasonably infer that the data in these indices have common features in a certain column of the CV contributor, which causes a privacy leakage. Adding shuffling to this design cannot solve above inference. Because in VFL, we can only shuffle the index of data, the mapping of other features among all clients remain the same (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 3.1.5.

However, the system becomes vulnerable when multiple parties collude. This can lead to even more severe security problems, as other advanced attacks may also pose a threat to GTV.

Although it is not required for a tabular dataset to have a target column for data synthesis, we have chosen to use datasets with a target column for the purpose of classification evaluation. This allows us to test the utility of the synthetic data for machine learning tasks compared to real data. Due to computing resource limitations, we randomly sample 50K rows of data in a stratified manner with respect to the target variable for the Covertype, Credit, and Intrusion datasets. The Adult and Loan datasets are not sampled. For all the datasets, we train the algorithms 300 epochs for all the experiments.

These include the use of one-hot encoding for categorical columns, mode-specific normalization for continuous columns, mixed-type encoder for columns containing both categorical and continuous values. The construction method of the conditional vector is also adopted from CT-GAN. All of these techniques are incorporated into our centralized tabular GAN.
The generator and discriminator structures are based on those used in CT-GAN. The generator is a Resnet-style <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He

The synthetic and real training data are then used to train five widely used machine learning algorithms (decision tree classifier, linear support vector machine, random forest classifier, multinomial logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron). The trained models are then evaluated on the real test set. Performance is measured using accuracy, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, difference between models trained by real and synthetic data is reported. The goal of this design is to determine whether synthetic data can be used as a substitute for real data to train machine learning models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of the experiments is to determine the optimal configuration of GTV for synthesizing high-fidelity tabular data. To this end, we aim to answer three research questions:
(1) What is the optimal partition of generator and discriminator neural networks between the server and clients?
(2) How does GTV respond to variations in number of data features across clients.
(3) How does GTV adapt to changes in the number of clients participating in the system.
To answer these questions, we have designed three experiments.
The centralized baseline serves as the basic tabular GAN algorithm for GTV to distribute and train in VFL.
In practice, the number of clients in a VFL scenario is constrained by the number of features in the tabular dataset. Therefore, following the VFL experiments setup in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Luo

The GTV architecture can be readily expanded to accommodate more clients. We assess the influence of the number of clients in Section <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS3" title="4.3.3.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">For this experiment, we evenly split the training datasets for two clients (or one client may have one more column if the total number of columns is odd), and the column orders are preserved as they were downloaded. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.1. Experiment Setup ‣ 4. Empirical Evaluation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we propose three ways to partition the neural networks of both the generator and discriminator across the server and clients. Both the generator and discriminator have two network blocks (same as in centralized baseline), so we consider three divisions for each of them: (i) all blocks in the server, (ii) one block in the server and one block in each client, (iii) all blocks in the client. This results in a total of nine combinations.

distributed among two clients. In this experiment, we examine the impact of data partition on these setups of GTV.
For each dataset, we use the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lundberg and Lee, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to evaluate the importance of each feature in predicting the target column using a MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) model with one hidden layer containing 100 neurons.
We sort the features importance and consider three different feature divisions: (i) 1090: the 10% most important features and the remaining 90%, (ii) 5050: 50% most important features and 50% remaining features, and (iii) 9010: 90% most important features and 10% remaining features. For each division, we assign the two parts to two clients. The target column is always located on the client WITHOUT the most important features.
The intuition behind these designs is that it is easier to learn the correlations among features within a single client than it is to learn correlations among features distributed across multiple clients.

Focusing on the ML utility metrics, we see that data partition has a smaller impact on the final synthetic data for the Adult and Covtype datasets, but a much larger impact on the Loan, Intrusion, and Credit datasets, where the 9010 partition leads to significantly worse results compared to the other two configurations. Regardless of the size of the impact, we observe on almost all datasets that the 1090 partition consistently performs better than the 5050 partition, which in turn performs better than the 9010 partition.
This because each dataset contains several important features for predicting the target column, and as these features are excluded step-by-step from the label holder, it reduces GTV’s ability to fully capture the correlations between these features and the label.
The results for statistical similarity are similar across all datasets and configurations. Since the Diff. Coff. is on a different scale than the other metrics, it is not included in the same figure. Instead, it is shown in Tab. <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3.2. Training Data Partition ‣ 4.3. Result Analysis ‣ 4. Empirical Evaluation ‣ GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. This result supports the finding from the ML utility metric, where the 1090 partition consistently demonstrates better feature correlation than the other two configurations. This validates our hypothesis that a larger number of features on the label holder allows GTV to more accurately capture correlations between features and label, resulting in the improvement in ML utility.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">One might argue that when organizing a vertical federated learning group, the data partition is fixed and determined by the clients. However, when clients join vertical federated learning, it is possible for different clients to have overlapping features, and in such cases, we have the option to distribute more features to the label holder to improve ML utility for the synthetic data. This is because we only need one of the overlapping features to be present in the system. For datasets without a target column, we can try to balance the feature distribution among clients to avoid artificially creating imbalances that could degrade the training of GTV.</p>

The results for two settings on generator revealed that the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enlarged</span> setting has less variation as the number of clients increases, which aligns with the ML utility outcome. However, when there are only two clients in the system, the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enlarged</span> setting performs worse on the Loan dataset.
The output dimension of the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.5.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enlarged</span> setting is determined through trial and error, highlighting the importance of considering the trade-off between the size of the neural network and the speed of model convergence. It is worth noting that increasing the size of the neural network does not always lead to improved results.
Given that the Loan dataset only contains 5000 data instances, increasing the neural network size resulted in slower convergence for the generator in the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.5.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enlarged</span> setting.
To ensure a fair comparison, we always sample synthetic data from the 300th epoch. As a result, the performance of the <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p3.5.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enlarged</span> setting is inferior. Optimal neural network size exploration for GTV under different dataset and different number of clients is left for future work</p>

The experiments show that a key factor for a successful GTV is having a sufficiently large discriminator model on the server side.

If control over the distribution of data columns among clients is possible, for example, through the exclusion of certain overlapping data columns in certain clients, it is recommended to balance the number of columns among the clients in the system. With a fixed total number of features in the system, an increasing number of clients in GTV reduces the quality of synthetic data. Strategically increasing the generator model size can effectively counter this performance degradation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a framework GTV which trains tabular data synthesizer via vertical federated learning. GTV designs a privacy-preserving architecture which allows to train state-of-the-art tabular GAN with distributed clients where each of them contains unique features. GTV also proposes a training mechanism called <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">training-with-shuffling</span> in order to adopt the conditional vector into tabular GAN training. Results show that GTV can generate synthetic data that capture the column dependencies from different clients, the synthetic data quality is comparable to the one generated by the centralized tabular GAN, as low as to 2.7% difference on machine learning utility. GTV can maintain stable on synthetic data column distribution even under extreme imbalanced data distribution across clients and different number of clients, making it a robust and scalable solution for generating synthetic tabular data in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner. Beyond this work, one of the challenges is to investigate measures to counteract collusion between the server and clients. Another interesting area of research is how to defend against data poisoning attacks.</p>
