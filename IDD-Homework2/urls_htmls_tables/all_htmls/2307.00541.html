<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we examine cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks, where edges undertake a range of typical dynamic scheduling tasks.
In these IoT networks, a central policy for each task can be constructed at a cloud server.
The central policy can be then used by the edges conducting the task, thereby mitigating the need for them to learn their own policy from scratch.
Furthermore, this central policy can be collaboratively learned at the cloud server by aggregating local experiences from the edges, thanks to the hierarchical architecture of the IoT networks.
To this end, we propose a novel collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks using federated reinforcement learning.
For effective learning, our framework adaptively selects the tasks for collaborative learning in each round, taking into account the need for fairness among tasks.
In addition, as a key enabler of the framework, we propose an edge-agnostic policy structure that enables the aggregation of local policies from different edges.
We then provide the convergence analysis of the framework.
Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the approaches without collaborative policy learning. Notably, it accelerates the learning speed of the policies and allows newly arrived edges to adapt to their tasks more easily.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the recent explosive development of internet-of-things (IoT) applications, a hierarchical architecture for IoT networks has been widely studied to ensure agility, flexibility, and scalability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In this hierarchical architecture, IoT networks can be decomposed into edges and a cloud-edge network, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Each edge forms its own network, called an edge network, comprising an access point (AP) and IoT terminal devices, while the cloud-edge network consists of a cloud server and edge networks.
Such hierarchical IoT networks are typically referred to as cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks, as they consist of a cloud server, edges, and IoT terminal devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this hierarchical architecture, edges in IoT networks carry out numerous <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tasks</span>, such as inference, prediction, planning, and scheduling, to support various IoT applications and services.
In particular, a variety of <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic scheduling tasks</span> have been widely considered as major tasks in IoT networks.
Dynamic scheduling tasks typically involve a problem, where an item is chosen from multiple items to achieve a goal, which has been widely considered in various applications, from recommendation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to resource scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to queueing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
In IoT networks, different edge functionalities, such as radio resource management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, data gathering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and wireless power transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, correspond to this problem, in which an edge selects an IoT terminal device from multiple IoT terminal devices for the corresponding functionalities.
It is worth emphasizing that in typical IoT networks, multiple edges share common dynamic scheduling tasks since these functionalities are generally used in IoT networks.
For example, most edge nodes should conduct radio resource management tasks to serve IoT terminal devices. Additionally, in most sensor applications, each edge node carries out data aggregation scheduling tasks, which schedule IoT terminal devices to effectively aggregate data from each IoT terminal device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To efficiently address dynamic scheduling tasks in IoT networks, deep learning, especially deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has been widely applied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
DRL is one of the representative methods for solving complex stochastic problems, thanks to the large representational capability of deep learning.
Specifically, in DRL-based approaches, an agent directly learns a policy represented by a deep neural network (DNN) model to address its task using data or experiences obtained from interactions with environments.
Consequently, these approaches allow each edge to find policies for its tasks without the formulation and optimization of complex scheduling task problems based on hand-crafted mathematical models, as in traditional approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks, a cloud server can play the role of coordinator to manage policies for tasks, thanks to the hierarchical architecture.
Therefore, it may be possible that a central policy for each dynamic scheduling task can be constructed at a cloud server.
Then, newly arrived edges can avoid performance deterioration due to an initial learning phase by using the central policy instead of learning its own policy.
Besides, with the coordination of the cloud server, the edges that conduct the task can cooperate in learning the central policy so as to learn the policy more efficiently.
One intuitive way for such cooperation is to directly collect <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data</span> (i.e., experiences) from the edges to the cloud server.
The cloud server then learns a policy to solve the problem using the collected data and redistributes the policy to the edges.
However, this approach is impractical since directly uploading the data from edges to the cloud server causes privacy and security issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, it incurs unaffordable communication costs due to the transmission of an enormous amount of data from all the edges to the cloud server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As a viable solution to address these issues, federated learning has been widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In federated learning, a cloud server and local learners sharing an identical task can cooperate to efficiently train a central DNN model to address the task.
Specifically, in each round, each local learner trains its local DNN model using its local training data and uploads its trained local DNN model to the cloud server instead of its local data.
The cloud server can then improve the central model by aggregating the received local models and redistributing it to the local learners.
This enables the central model to be trained in a distributed manner while avoiding privacy issues.
By applying this procedure to DRL, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has also been studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
We refer the reader to comprehensive surveys of federated learning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The hierarchical architecture of cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks is suitable for applying federated learning to collaboratively learn a policy for each task.
Since multiple edges share an identical task, each edge can act as a local learner for the policy of the task, and the cloud server can aggregate the local policies of the edges.
Thus, federated learning in cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks has been studied for tasks such as mobile keyboard prediction, cyberattack detection, and energy demand prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
However, there is no work yet on FRL frameworks that enables edges to collaboratively address their <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic scheduling tasks</span>, even though a variety of works for dynamic scheduling tasks have been studied based on DRL.
This is because conventional DRL-based approaches that have been studied so far are inapplicable to FRL.
Specifically, they are developed to learn a policy focused on achieving its goal only in a target edge.
Consequently, the policy focuses on addressing the characteristics of the target edge, such as the number of IoT terminal devices and the statistics of system uncertainties, rather than generalizing them for application to all edges.
Furthermore, the conventional DRL-based approaches make the corresponding policies for different target edges have different structures, even if their tasks are identical.
As a result, it is difficult to aggregate the policies learned from different edges via FRL due to their dependency on <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">edge-specific</span> characteristics.
Therefore, to enable edges to collaboratively learn policies for dynamic scheduling tasks, a novel policy structure is needed which can be used for any different edges while avoiding such edge-specific characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Even if FRL can be applied for collaborative policy learning for dynamic scheduling tasks in cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks, it is difficult to simply use it because of the scarcity of cloud resources, such as computing power, memory, and network bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
The larger the number of edges participating in FRL for collaborative policy learning, the greater the usage of cloud resources, making it harder to aggregate local policies for all tasks.
Moreover, while the larger number of edges participating in FRL generally improves the efficiency of FRL due to the increased amount of experiences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, some edges may not be available to participate in FRL in each round.
Hence, to maximize the effectiveness of collaborative policy learning, the tasks whose local policies are to be aggregated in each round should be carefully selected to effectively utilize limited cloud resources while considering the following factors: the number of available edges for each task in the round and the number of edges that have participated in FRLg of each task so far.
However, there is no such work on collaborative policy learning frameworks for tasks in cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks yet.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study collaborative policy learning for dynamic scheduling tasks in cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks.
In these IoT networks, edges share a variety of dynamic scheduling tasks, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Specifically, each edge conducts its own dynamic scheduling tasks and learns the policies for the corresponding tasks using DRL.
Meanwhile, a cloud server trains the central policy for each task by aggregating the local policies that are learned at different edges via FRL.
To this end, we propose a collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks in cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks.
In this framework, a cloud server manages the policy for each dynamic scheduling task, which is commonly conducted across multiple edges, and learns it by aggregating the local policies for the task from the edges.
This collaborative learning process accelerates the learning speed of the policy for each task in the cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks.
Additionally, when new edges arrive in the network, they can easily adapt to conducting their tasks by utilizing the central policies for the tasks.</p>

Each edge selects an IoT device and makes decisions relevant to scheduling (e.g., transmission power in wireless network scheduling and the number of jobs to be serviced in job scheduling) to achieve the goal of the respective task.
Additionally, each edge considers each IoT device’s conditions relevant to scheduling (e.g., the current queue length in queue scheduling and the channel conditions in wireless network scheduling) for effective scheduling.</p>

To this end, standard dynamic programming (DP) approaches, such as value iteration and policy iteration, and traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, such as SARSA and Q-learning, can be used.
However, DP approaches are generally impractical for practical applications, as they require perfect prior information on system uncertainties.
Also, both of DP and RL have a large computational complexity due to the curse of dimensionality.
To overcome these practical limitations, DRL has been widely used recently to solve such problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In DRL, an agent constructs a DNN that can represent the policy of the problem.
The agent then trains the DNN to approximate the optimal policy to solve the problem.
Consequently, each edge can solve its dynamic scheduling problem by training a policy represented by a DNN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.9" class="ltx_p">Since the policy is represented as a DNN with such an approach based on DRL, a central DNN (i.e. a central policy) for each task may be collaboratively learned at the cloud server.
To this end, we can use FRL to learn the central DNN by effectively aggregating the local DNNs (i.e., the local policies) from all edges conducting the task.
We now describe the FRL procedure for collaborative policy learning for dynamic scheduling tasks in the IoT network.

The time horizon of FRL typically spans a larger time scale than that of each task.
As a result, FRL aggregates the DNNs, which are locally trained by the edges over multiple time slots, in each round.

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FRL operates in an IoT network to handle multiple tasks.
However, as described in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A System Model of Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks ‣ II Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks With Multiple Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a>, it must do so using only limited cloud resources, such as computing power, memory, and network bandwidth.
This limitation implies that if there are not enough cloud resources to proceed with FRL for all tasks in each round, only a subset of tasks may be selected for FRL.
Specifically, the amount of cloud resources required to conduct FRL for each task depends on the number of edges participating in FRL.
In each round, some edges may be unable to participate in FRL due to various reasons, such as other higher-priority jobs or network shutdowns for energy-saving purposes.
However, in typical FRL, once the central parameters are updated by aggregating the local parameters of participating edges, the local parameters of non-participating edges are abandoned.
All edges’ local parameters are then substituted by the central parameters.
This is because using outdated local parameters in FRL may negatively affect the convergence of central parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, according to the convergence analysis of FRL, the effectiveness of FRL improves as the number of participants in FRL and corresponding data increases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
This implies that even if tasks are selected uniformly, the effectiveness of FRL for each task may vary significantly based on the number of participants.
Therefore, to ensure that all tasks benefit fairly from FRL, it is essential to consider fairness in terms of the number of participants, rather than the number of times they are selected.
In conclusion, to effectively utilize cloud resources for FRL, tasks should be carefully selected to maximize the number of participants while maintaining fairness among tasks in terms of the number of participants.

This strategy aims to maximize the number of participating edges in FRL and ensure that all tasks derive benefits.
To achieve this goal, we adopt a fairness concept in terms of the number of participating edges.
By taking the fairness into account in the average number of participating edges, we can guarantee that all tasks, including those operating at a smaller number of edges, benefit from FRL.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we discussed in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Edges ‣ II Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks With Multiple Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>, the diverse range of dynamic scheduling tasks, such as wireless power transfer, data gathering, and radio resource scheduling, have an identical problem structure in (<a href="#S2.E3" title="In II-B Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Edges ‣ II Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks With Multiple Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).
Hence, if multiple edges share such identical tasks, for each task, they also share the identical problem structure, which is determined by the types of state information, decisions, and reward function for the task.
However, as emphasized in Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="III-B2 Collaborative Learning-Inapplicability of Conventional Policy Structures ‣ III-B Key Challenges on Collaborative Policy Learning ‣ III Concept and Key Challenges on Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2</span></a>, the edges typically have different <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamics,</span> due to the varying number of IoT devices and system uncertainties.
This renders conventional dynamic scheduling policies to be inapplicable to collaborative policy learning because of its lack of generalization capability, as discussed in Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="III-B2 Collaborative Learning-Inapplicability of Conventional Policy Structures ‣ III-B Key Challenges on Collaborative Policy Learning ‣ III Concept and Key Challenges on Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">To ensure that a policy for each task is capable of generalization over different edges that conduct the task, it should be designed to represent states and actions in a way that is independent of the dynamics of the edges.
Furthermore, the policy should be able to learn a scheduling principle, capable of identifying which <span id="S4.SS2.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">condition (i.e., state information)</span> of IoT devices is more favorable for effective scheduling.
For example, suppose a policy that represents such a principle for task <math id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">l</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑙</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">l</annotation></semantics></math>.

If each edge learns a DNN that represents such a policy using DRL, the DNNs from all edges can be aggregated via FRL thanks to the generalization capability across the edges.
Consequently, it would enable collaborative policy learning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we propose a collaborative learning-applicable edge-agnostic policy structure that satisfies the aforementioned features by borrowing the concept of the circumstance-independent (CI) policy structure in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The CI policy structure represents a policy for the radio resource scheduling problem in a single-cell wireless network, regardless of the network’s dynamic circumstances.
For an edge-agnostic policy structure, we generalize the concept of the CI policy structure for dynamic scheduling tasks and extend it to be used in multiple edges for FRL.
Next, we present edge-agnostic state and action structures. These structures focus on the <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">conditions</span> of the IoT devices in each edge, rather than on each <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IoT device</span> itself, as in (<a href="#S2.E1" title="In II-B Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Edges ‣ II Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks With Multiple Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) and (<a href="#S2.E2" title="In II-B Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Edges ‣ II Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks With Multiple Dynamic Scheduling Tasks ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

This implies that when the edge-agnostic policy for each task is learned through DRL, its corresponding DNN is trained to approximate the optimal general scheduling principle for the task that has a generalization capability over different edges.
Therefore, the edge-agnostic policy can be utilized in any edges with task <math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml">l</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1.1">𝑙</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.4.m4.1c">l</annotation></semantics></math>, even if the edges have different dynamics such as the numbers of IoT devices.
Consequently, FRL can be applied to the DNN for collaborative learning thanks to the generalization capability.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.11" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we propose a collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks in IoT networks leveraging FRL.
The framework is built upon the task selection algorithm and the collaborative learning-applicable scheduling policy discussed in previous subsections.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we showcase experimental results evaluating the performance of our proposed collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks.
To achieve this, we have created a dedicated Python-based simulator and run simulations on a simulated IoT network composed of multiple edges.
Each edge is assigned one of the following three tasks:</p>
<ul id="S5.I1" class="ltx_itemize">

In each time slot, an AP wirelessly transfers power to a selected IoT device, with the charging rate being dependent on the device’s channel condition.
If an IoT device is in an active state, its battery is discharged at a given rate.
The active state stochastically changes based on a Markov model.
The battery level of each IoT device is updated according to its active state and the amount of wireless power transferred from the AP.
The active state, battery level, and charging rate of each IoT device are used as state information.
The cost in each time slot is determined by the number of IoT devices whose battery level is below a threshold and those whose battery is empty.
The negative cost is taken as a reward.</p>

In each time slot, an AP selects an IoT device to transmit its data samples to the AP.
The transmission capacity of each IoT device to gather the data sample is time-varying, and the data samples randomly arrive at the buffer of each IoT device.
If the buffer overflows, the exceeded data samples are dropped.
The remaining buffer size and transmission capacity of each IoT device are used as state information.
The reward in each time slot is defined as the the number of gathered data samples minus the number of dropped data samples in that time slot.</p>

In each time slot, an AP selects an IoT device to serve and the corresponding transmission power.
The determined transmission power then impacts the achievable data rate for the IoT device, following the Shannon capacity.
The data rate depends on the IoT device’s channel gain, which varies over time based on a channel model with a log-normal shadowing.
IoT devices also update their degree of dissatisfaction regarding the data rate requirements (DoD).
The channel gain and DoD of each IoT device are used as state information.
The reward for each time slot is calculated as the achieved data rate weighted by the DoD minus the transmission power.</p>

Note that Bench and No-FL are excluded from the figure as Bench reaches the maximum number of participants without resource constraint, while No-FL consistently achieves zero participants.
As observed from the figure, FL-PF attains a greater total number of participants than Greedy and RR, while ensuring fairness among the tasks in terms of participant numbers.
Conversely, FL-Greedy and FL-RR lead to more edges participating in task A than tasks B and C.
This imbalance creates unfairness among the tasks and may result in tasks B and C not achieving enough performance improvement from collaborative policy learning.
These observations suggest that FL-PF selects tasks in a manner that promotes effective collaborative policy learning, considering the time-varying availability conditions of edges and limited resources.
We delve into a more detailed comparison of the performances of the different algorithms in the following subsections.</p>

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Participants of Collaborative Policy Learning ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>, all collaborative policy learning algorithms (i.e., Bench, FL-PF, FL-Greedy, and FL-RR) successfully meet the minimum number of participants requirement.
Due to task A having the highest arrival rate, FL-Greedy excessively selects task A in nearly every round, which results in a participant count close to that of Bench.
However, as indicated in Figs. <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Participants of Collaborative Policy Learning ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F4.sf3" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Participants of Collaborative Policy Learning ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Collaborative Policy Learning for Dynamic Scheduling Tasks in Cloud-Edge-Terminal IoT Networks Using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4c</span></a>, only FL-PF fulfills the minimum number of participants for tasks B and C.
FL-Greedy falls short of the minimum because of its skewed selection towards task A.
Conversely, while FL-RR selects tasks in a circularly fair manner, it does not take the number of participants into account, leading to fluctuating participant counts that depend on the arrival rate of each task.
From these figures, it is clear that FL-PF consistently meets the minimum number of participants across all tasks.</p>

Specifically, our collaborative policy learning framework can immediately utilize the task policy located at the cloud server when a new edge with a task arrives.

These results distinctly underscore the effectiveness of our collaborative policy learning framework in managing dynamic edge arrivals in realistic IoT networks.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a collaborative policy learning framework for the dynamic scheduling tasks in IoT networks using FRL.
This framework effectively utilizes limited cloud resources while ensuring fair local policy aggregation across tasks.
To achieve this, we developed a task selection algorithm that maximizes the average number of participants (i.e., participating edges) in collaborative policy learning while satisfying the minimum number of edges required for each task.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A key enabler of the proposed framework is the edge-agnostic policy structure that we proposed for dynamic scheduling tasks, which is applicable to collaborative learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework offers significant performance improvements compared to algorithms without collaborative policy learning.
Notably, the collaborative policy learning approach, when combined with our proposed task selection algorithm, achieves the best performance.
Furthermore, our results clearly illustrate the framework’s adaptability to newly arrived edges and its ability to accelerate the learning speed of the policy.</p>

Since we can easily derive these equations in similar steps to Corollary 4.0.1 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, we here omit the proofs and refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> for more details.
