<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Decentralized federated learning, inherited from decentralized learning, enables the edge devices to collaborate on model training in a peer-to-peer manner without the assistance of a server.
However, existing decentralized learning frameworks usually assume perfect communication among devices, where they can reliably exchange messages, <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, gradients or parameters.
But the real-world communication networks are prone to packet loss and transmission errors.
Transmission reliability comes with a price.
The commonly-used solution is to adopt a reliable transportation layer protocol, <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, transmission control protocol (TCP), which however leads to significant communication overhead and reduces connectivity among devices that can be supported.
For a communication network with a lightweight and unreliable communication protocol, user datagram protocol (UDP), we propose a robust decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, called Soft-DSGD, to address the unreliability issue.
Soft-DSGD updates the model parameters with partially received messages and optimizes the mixing weights according to the link reliability matrix of communication links.
We prove that the proposed decentralized training system, even with unreliable communications, can still achieve the same asymptotic convergence rate as vanilla decentralized SGD with perfect communications.
Moreover, numerical results confirm the proposed approach can leverage all available unreliable communication links to speed up convergence.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Empowered by massive training data, deep learning is emerging as the major driving force behind breakthroughs in a wide range of areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, etc.
Inspired by these success stories, there is a growing trend to use deep learning to unleash the power of massive data generated at the edge network by such devices as smart phones, wearables, and sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, the limited communication bandwidth, together with the desire for user privacy, makes it infeasible to collect all distributed data and then train a model at a single machine.
As an alternative, training deep learning models at edge networks in a distributed fashion has gained much attention in, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
It enables multiple devices to compute multiple devices compute the local mini-batch gradients of the loss function with their local datasets and only exchange model parameters or gradients over a communication network to ensure convergence to the global optimal solution, and protect the privacy of the local devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional federated learning is designed with a parameter-server architecture as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Unreliable Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a), where a centralized server orchestrates the training process.
In each training iteration, the global model is transmitted to the participating edge devices and these devices compute a set of potential model updates based on local data.
These updates are then sent to the central server and aggregated into a single global update.
Since all the selected devices have to send updates to a single centralized server in each training iteration, the server becomes a communication bottleneck of the system, which makes it difficult to scale to a large number of devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on the decentralized training paradigm building on the device-to-device (D2D) network, which facilitates collaborative learning made possible by the ability to communicate among the edge devices without the assistance of the server.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Unreliable Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b), each device stores and optimizes the model parameters with its own data and exchanges messages with neighbours in a peer-to-peer manner to reach a consensus. Decentralized optimization has been investigated intensively since 1980s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The most widely-used decentralized algorithms include gradient and subgradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and dual averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Recently, decentralized implementations of SGD for training deep learning models have gained much attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
The decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> for optimizing non-convex objectives (<em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, training deep neural networks) and proven to have the same asymptotic convergence rate as the centralized SGD.
This framework has been extended to deal with variations in communication paradigms. An asynchronous decentralized SGD framework has been developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, where the devices communicate asynchronously to reduce the idle time.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, gradient push-sum has been exploited to develop a decentralized SGD under a directed communication network.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A major bottleneck in achieving fast convergence is the limited communication resources, such as bandwidth and power.
To reduce the communication cost in decentralized training, prior works on building communication-efficient decentralized training systems have concentrated on compressing the communication messages via sparsification and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, skipping the communication rounds by performing a certain number of local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, or communicating in an asynchronous manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
It has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that directly compressing the shared messages leads to non-vanishing quantization errors, which in turn causes failure to converge.
The first exact decentralized optimization method with message quantization has been developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> for strongly convex objectives.
For non-convex optimization, quantization approaches have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, where the differences of parameters of two consecutive steps are quantized and shared.
Moreover, DeepSqueeze in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> applies an error-compensation method to decentralized settings.
ChocoSGD in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> lets devices estimate remote models with a local estimator, which supports arbitrary quantization by tuning the communication matrix.
Apart from compressing the communication messages, another direction to improve the communication efficiency is reducing the communication frequency.
The devices take several local SGD update steps before a consensus update with other devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, most of the existing decentralized optimization methods require a reliable communication network among the devices while the real-world communication systems are prone to packet loss and transmission errors.
The transmission errors are pervasive in federated learning due to the harsh wireless channels, which introduce noise, fading, and interference.
The default solution is to use a reliable transportation layer communication protocol, <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</span> transmission control protocol (TCP), where acknowledgment (ACK), retransmission, and time-out mechanisms are employed to detect and recover from transmission failures.
But this transmission reliability comes with a price, which usually incurs considerable communication overheads since the messages may be transmitted multiple times.
In addition, the number of neighbours that each device can communicate with is limited to ensure reliability, which also slows down the training speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a lightweight transmission protocol, user datagram protocol (UDP), is adopted to provide connectionless and unreliable packet delivery service instead of using these reliable but heavyweight communication protocols.
Each device communicates with the rest of the network via soft and unreliable communication links, where packet loss and transmission errors occur randomly.
A robust decentralized training algorithm, called Soft-DSGD, is developed to deal with the unreliable communications.
The devices update their model parameters with partially received messages and the mixing weights in the consensus updates are optimized according to the reliability matrix of different communication links.
We prove that the proposed Soft-DSGD under the unreliable communication network achieves the same asymptotic convergence rate as the vanilla decentralized SGD with perfect communications.
In addition, numerical results confirm that Soft-DSGD can efficiently leverage all unreliable communication links that are available to accelerate convergence.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the existing decentralized optimization methods require a reliable communication network among the devices while the real-world edge communication systems are prone to packet loss and transmission errors.
TCP and UDP are widely-used transportation layer protocols for transmitting data packets over a communication network.
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and requires handshakes to set up an end-to-end communication connection, where messages can be transmitted in both directions. TCP leverages mechanisms including ACK messages, retransmission, and timeouts to guarantee the transmission reliability.
The recipient sends ACK messages back to the sender once receiving the messages correctly. Otherwise, the transmitter will resend the packets to the recipient.
When TCP is used in broadcast and multi-cast scenarios, reliability is guaranteed for each recipient.
Hence, TCP has a considerable communication overhead, especially in unreliable communication networks, such as wireless systems.
Compared to TCP, UDP is a lightweight message-based connectionless protocol with much less overhead and does not need to set up a dedicated connection for transmission.
Communication is achieved by transmitting packets in one direction from the source to the destination without verifying whether the recipients have received the packets. Due to the unreliability nature of UDP, it is mainly used for delivery best effort traffic, such as multimedia streaming, where occasional packet loss can be tolerated.</p>

Due to channel reciprocity, the link reliability is the same for transmissions in two directions on the same communication link.
In addition, the assumption on independence of the links is valid as long as the distance between devices are much larger than the wavelength of the signal and the link reliability remains stable if the devices are static during the training.
Note that Soft-DSGD can be directly applied in the dynamic environment, where the link reliability matrix changes with time. We concentrate on the static reliability matrix in order to make the analysis easy to understand.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have designed a robust decentralized training framework, called Soft-DSGD, to deal with unreliable communication links.
Instead of using connection-orientated protocols, such as TCP, to ensure the reliability but with considerable overhead, Soft-DSGD uses lightweight and unreliable communication protocols, such as UDP, with low communication overhead, but is robust to communication failures.
We prove that Soft-DSGD, even with unreliable communications, converges at the same asymptotic rate as the vanilla decentralize SGD over a reliable communication network.
From the numerical experiments, Soft-DSGD can leverage information collected from all unreliable communication links to accelerate convergence.</p>
