<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Fully decentralized learning is gaining momentum for training AI models at the Internet’s edge, addressing infrastructure challenges and privacy concerns. In a decentralized machine learning system, data is distributed across multiple nodes, with each node training a local model based on its respective dataset. The local models are then shared and combined to form a global model capable of making accurate predictions on new data. Our exploration focuses on how different types of network structures influence the spreading of knowledge - the process by which nodes incorporate insights gained from learning patterns in data available on other nodes across the network.
Specifically, this study investigates the intricate interplay between network structure and learning performance using three network topologies and six data distribution methods. These methods consider different vertex properties, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, along with whether nodes exhibit high or low values of these metrics. Our findings underscore the significance of global centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) in correlating with learning performance, while local clustering proves less predictive. We highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from peripheral to central nodes, attributed to a dilution effect during model aggregation. Additionally, we observe that central nodes exert a pull effect, facilitating the spread of knowledge. In examining degree distribution, hubs in Barabási-Albert networks positively impact learning for central nodes but exacerbate dilution when knowledge originates from peripheral nodes. Finally, we demonstrate the formidable challenge of knowledge circulation outside of segregated communities.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The modern technology ecosystem is experiencing a dramatic shift characterised by the exponential growth of devices at the Edge of the network, together with the enormous expansion of data that they create.
The most popular network paradigm for AI is currently a centralised one, that involves transferring data collected at the edge towards big data centres, where data are processed and large-scale AI models are trained. These trained models are then deployed to furnish AI-based services. Despite proving effective, this centralized approach raises several concerns related to data privacy and ownership. Even with the prospect of benefiting from centralised AI-based services, data generators at the network’s edge are becoming less eager to disclose their private data to third parties. These worries are fueling a paradigm shift from centralised AI systems to decentralised ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, solutions based on decentralised AI systems, such as Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, have been proposed. In FL, the idea is to avoid the transfer of raw data, keeping the data locally at the edge devices. Specifically, the devices collaboratively train an AI model without sharing any raw data with each other. They only share the parameters of the AI models that are trained locally. These parameters are then aggregated to produce a better and capable <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global</em> model that is iteratively refined through successive rounds of collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The standard definition of the FL framework assumes a starred network topology, where a central server orchestrates the entire process, coordinating the operations of the participating devices. However, the presence of a centralised controller introduces some challenges. It could potentially serve as a single point of failure, a potential bottleneck when the number of involved devices reaches millions, and an impediment to spontaneous, direct collaborations among users.
In response to these challenges, a rising trend is emerging in favour of supporting fully decentralised variations of FL.
Decentralised Federated Learning (DFL) represents an alternative to centralised Federated Learning. In DFL the connectivity between devices is represented by a generic graph, and the devices involved in the learning process typically collaborate only with their neighbours.
The lack of a central controller overcomes the single point of failure problem but introduces other aspects that need to be investigated. Specifically, we claim that, in this scenario, the information locality and the network topology strongly affect the dynamics of the learning process, i.e. how fast and effective the spreading of knowledge about the class labels is.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> assumes that the network topology can be controlled by the network operator and optimized to make the learning process more efficient or scalable, we argue that complete decentralization can only be achieved by letting user devices spontaneously organize themselves. This implies that the network topology, in these settings, cannot be controlled by the operator. For example, an edge between two nodes in the graph may represent a trust relationship or willingness to cooperate. If the edges are weighted, the strength of the weights expresses the intensity of trust or cooperation. With this approach, users are free to cooperate with whomever they want, and the operator has no control over the cooperation patterns. Although this scenario poses a challenge from a learning perspective, it also fully exploits the human-centric, impromptu potential of fully decentralized learning systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Given these considerations, the primary research question addressed in this paper concerns the impact of network topology on the learning process within a fully decentralised learning system.
Specifically, we examine a scenario where a group of devices collaborates to train a unified AI model in a completely decentralized environment, connected to each other through a complex network topology. Following the DFL framework, each participating device receives a set of models from its graph-connected neighbours. At first, these models undergo an initial aggregation step with the local model, usually through a weighted average, resulting in a refreshed aggregate model. Subsequently, this aggregated model is updated via a number of local training epochs performed on local data. The newly updated models are then shared with neighbouring devices, and this iterative process continues until a stopping condition is met.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we examine three network topologies: Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, and Stochastic Block Model. Through simulations, we analyze how their underlying network structures impact the learning process, considering various non-IID data partitioning scenarios. Specifically, we assume that a subset of nodes possesses more knowledge than others, represented by classes unavailable on other nodes. We identify this subset of nodes based on the highest or lowest values of properties such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient. These properties capture the significance of nodes in the network and the connectivity within their local neighborhoods.
The main take-home messages from our analysis are the following.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DFL extends the typical settings of FL, e.g., data heterogeneity and non-convex optimisation, by removing the existence of the central parameter server. This is a relatively new topic that is gaining attention from the community since it fuses the privacy-related advantages of FL with the potentialities of decentralised and uncoordinated optimisation and learning.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the authors define a DFL framework for a medical application where a number of hospitals collaborate to train a Neural Network model on local and private data. They make use of a decentralised Federated Learning setting where multiple medical centers can collaborate and benefit from each other without sharing data among them. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> the authors propose a Bayesian-like approach where the aggregation phase is done by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the local model and the ones received from the peers. All these approaches are still considering that the nodes perform just one local update before sharing the parameters (or gradients) with the peers in the network. This aspect is relaxed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a federated consensus algorithm extending FedAvg from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> in decentralised settings, mainly considering industrial and IoT applications.
The authors propose a consensus-based serverless Federated Learning approach to tackle the issues that stem from massive IoT networks. The proposed FL algorithms leverage the cooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by iterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based methods. The proposed methodology is validated on an IIoT scenario typical of a 5G network infrastructure. A slightly different approach has been proposed by authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. They propose a variation in FL where the central server role is rotated among the participants, they refer to it as <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">flying master</em>, which is dynamically selected. They demonstrate a significant reduction of runtime using their proposed flying master FL framework compared to the original FL over real 5G networks. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposes a Federated Decentralised Average based on SGD in their research, where they incorporate a momentum term to counterbalance potential drift caused by multiple updates, along with a quantization scheme to reduce communication requirements. Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> addresses the heterogeneity and initialization problems of fully decentralized federated learning by proposing a novel learning strategy based on distance-weighted aggregation of models and knowledge distillation.</p>

In a fully decentralised setting, the communication network is essentially peer-to-peer (P2P).
The decentralised learning algorithms designed for such a P2P system are typically composed of two main blocks: one step for the local training of the model using local data and one step devoted to the exchange and aggregation of the models’ updates.

As a result, the topology determines the paths along which information, or “knowledge”, travels and influences the speed and efficiency of information dissemination. The structure of the network, such as its degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and connectivity patterns, can impact the performance and effectiveness of decentralised federated algorithms.
Thus, it is reasonable to expect the network topology to play a crucial role in DFL. This is the rationale for analyzing the impact of network topology in such settings.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">These three models capture important properties of complex networks. ER networks, which are random and well-mixed, provide insights into how information propagates in networks without a pronounced structure, with homogeneity in terms of degree and low clustering coefficient. BA graphs are characterised by a very skewed degree distribution with few high-degree nodes and many low-degree nodes. The presence of nodes with high degree can enhance rapid dissemination, contributing to efficient diffusion, but may overshadow the contribution of low degree nodes. Finally, SBM introduces the concept of community structure. SBM feature a well-defined community structure that allows us to investigate how knowledge spreads within and between communities.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For our experiments, we choose the widely used MNIST image dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. We selected MNIST because it is a well-understood dataset that allows us to focus our analysis on the dynamics induced by the network topology. This dataset contains a set of handwritten digits, thus data are divided into 10 classes. The goal of the analysis is to characterise the effect of the network topology in the knowledge spreading process, i.e., the ability of nodes to learn data patterns they have <em id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> seen locally, but that other nodes in the network have seen. Therefore, we split the MNIST classes across nodes as follows. Note that, on the assigned classes, each node gets the same amount of images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For ER and BA networks, we divide the 10 MNIST classes into two groups: the first group (G1) is composed of classes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the second group (G2) of classes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. All nodes receive an equal share (selected randomly) of data from G1. Data from G2 are allocated only to a subset of nodes, selected as follows. for each type of network measure considered, we examine two cases where data in G2 are assigned to the 10% of nodes with the highest values and the 10% with the lowest values, respectively. The rationale is thus to allocate “full knowledge" (i.e., a complete subset of all classes) either to high-centrality or low-centrality nodes, and study the effect of the network topology in both cases. In the following, these configurations are referred to as “highest-focus" and “lowest-focus", respectively.
The measures taken into account are:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">For the degree centrality measure, we will refer to the highest-focus and lowest-focus cases as hub-focus and edge-focus to easily distinguish the degree results with the other centrality measures.
Specifically, starting from the node(s) with the highest (lowest) centrality, we pick nodes until we reach 10% of the network. In case adding all nodes at a given centrality measure value results in more than 10% of the network, we randomly pick, among nodes with that centrality measure value, a subset that allows us to fill the 10% subset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">degree centrality</em> is calculated by taking the total number of edges connected to a node (i.e., its degree). Being directly connected with many other nodes, nodes with high degree centrality are generally expected to be more influential in the network, as they can reach many nodes at once leveraging their direct connections. When considering the degree centrality, low-centrality nodes are edge nodes (i.e., nodes at the periphery of the graph), hence we may use the terms lowest-focused and edge-focused interchangeably. Similarly for highest-focused and hub-focused.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The <em id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">betweenness centrality</em> measures the importance of a node in a network by quantifying its role as a connector or bridge between other nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. It identifies nodes that lie on a high number of shortest paths, which are the most efficient routes for information to travel between different parts of the network. These nodes play a critical role in facilitating communication and information flow, as they act as intermediaries between different communities or groups of nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality are often referred to as <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bridges</span>. In contrast, nodes with low betweenness centrality lie on relatively few shortest paths and are less influential in connecting different parts of the network. They are often referred to as
<span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">isolates</span>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S5.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clustering coefficient</span> of a node measures the proportion of its neighbours that are also connected to each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Nodes with higher clustering coefficient centrality have neighbours that are well-connected to each other, indicating the presence of cohesive groups or clusters in the network. The higher the clustering coefficient, the more homogeneous a group of nodes is in terms of connections, the more balanced information spread is expected to be within the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The rationale behind the choice of these centrality measures is their ability to capture distinct aspects of network dynamics and structure. Degree centrality highlights the importance of well-connected nodes, clustering coefficient emphasizes local connectivity patterns, and betweenness centrality identifies nodes critical for global information flow.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">For SBM networks, instead, we divided the dataset classes into subsets based on the communities the nodes belong to, without overlap. Therefore, since we study SBM topologies with 4 communities, each community gets two classes: community 1 sees classes 0 and 1; community 2 sees classes 2 and 3; community 3 sees classes 4 and 5; community 4 sees classes 6 and 7. This data distribution is designed to challenge the knowledge-spreading process since maximum learning accuracy can only be achieved if information from all the external communities is brought into the local one.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the learning task, we consider a simple classifier as model to be trained and we focus on two performance figures. On the one hand, we consider the accuracy over time at each node, to assess the effectiveness and speed of knowledge diffusion across the network.
On the other hand, for SBM networks, we also investigated the average confusion matrix across nodes of the same community. Specifically, for each node we compute the confusion matrix for the MNIST classes, and then take the average across all nodes in the same community.</p>

This allows us to draw direct comparisons between the main characteristics of a decentralized learning process on equivalent topologies (Section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="6.3 ER vs BA comparison ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.3</span></a>). Let us begin our analysis by considering the relationships between the centrality measures w.r.t. the considered network topology, as shown in the scatterplots of Figures <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>-<a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
The scatterplots in <a href="#S6.F6" title="In 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> show the relation between degree centrality and betweenness centrality for the three distinct configurations of the Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph. In these scatterplots, the highest-focus and lowest-focus nodes selected for the betweenness centrality metric are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.
The scatterplots show a relationship of direct proportionality between betweenness centrality and degree. Nodes with higher degrees tend to exhibit higher betweenness centrality, indicating that well-connected nodes also play crucial roles as bridges or intermediaries in the network.
Hence, we expect a similar behaviour of the system when data is distributed either according to the betweenness centrality or their degree.
<a href="#S6.F6" title="In 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows the scatterplots of the clustering coefficient vs the degree centrality: as it is common in such graphs, the higher the clustering coefficient, the lower the degree.
The intuitive understanding behind nodes with high clustering coefficients having smaller degrees lies in the fact that high-degree nodes, connected to numerous other nodes, are less likely to have tightly knit connections among their neighbours, causing them to cluster in the lower degree range of the plot.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We start our analysis with the case of data in the G2 subset being assigned based on the degree centrality.

The top-row plots refer to the edge-focused case, where the digits in class group G2 are assigned to edge nodes, while the bottom-row plots correspond to the hub-focused scenario, where the high-degree nodes get the G2 class data. As expected, the nodes that are assigned both G1 and G2 data (the group of curves with higher accuracy in the figure) show an excellent learning performance. It is more interesting to focus our attention on the other nodes, the ones assigned only data in G1 that can only learn the classes in G2 thanks to the knowledge (models) they receive from other nodes.

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we remarked when discussing <a href="#S6.F6" title="In 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the clustering coefficient has no significant relation with the degree centrality (and, as a result, with the betweenness centrality) in our ER graphs. This implies that the degree of nodes can be high or low regardless of their clustering coefficient. Given that degree centrality seems to be the main driver of knowledge spreading, we do not expect much variation in the accuracy between the highest and lowest focus cases. This is evident in <a href="#S6.F15" title="In 6.1.3 ER: Clustering coefficient used for G2 data assignment ‣ 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>. This implies that the <span id="S6.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">clustering coefficient does not reflect in any meaningful way the model aggregation and dissemination process. For this reason, whether G2 data are assigned to nodes with low or high clustering coefficients does not make a difference.</span>
The similar performance between the highest and lowest focus cases is further confirmed by the mean accuracy curves of all G1 nodes showed in <a href="#S6.F15" title="In 6.1.3 ER: Clustering coefficient used for G2 data assignment ‣ 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>, where we can see that the curves have a small gap, with the highest focus case being above the lowest focus one with the exception of the last scenario.
In the high-focus case an increase of connectivity does not help much since high-focus nodes are anyway poorly connected. In the low-focus case this is the opposite, and rightmost plot of <a href="#S6.F15" title="In 6.1.3 ER: Clustering coefficient used for G2 data assignment ‣ 6.1 Decentralised learning over Erdős-Rényi graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a> shows that, in this case, the effect of higher connectivity for the low-focus case is more important then allocating G2 on most central nodes.</p>

Preliminarily, we investigate, as we did for ER, the relationship between the different centrality measures used for G2 data assignment (<a href="#S6.F17" title="In 6.2 Decentralised learning over Barabási-Albert graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>). The relationship between degree and betweenness centrality is still one of direct proportionality, as expected, but with a more pronounced quadratic trend. Note, also, that nodes reach much higher values for both centrality metrics with BA, which follows directly from the topological properties of BA networks. Moreover, due to the power law nature of the BA degree distribution,
the nodes chosen for the highest focus case (those indicated by the red dots) span a wider range of degrees than in ER.
When looking at the degree centrality vs clustering coefficient (<a href="#S6.F17" title="In 6.2 Decentralised learning over Barabási-Albert graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>), BA graphs exhibit nodes with both high and low clustering coefficients concentrated on the left-hand side of the scatterplot, suggesting a generally low degree for these nodes (with the exception of some nodes with a medium-range degree when <math id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m=5" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">m</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑚</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">m=5</annotation></semantics></math>).</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Looking at the individual curves of the accuracy over time in <a href="#S6.F25" title="In 6.2.3 BA: Clustering coefficient used for G2 data assignment ‣ 6.2 Decentralised learning over Barabási-Albert graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">25</span></a>, we can see that the behaviour is similar between the highest and lowest focus cases, as a result of the negligible difference among the degrees of the selected nodes for G2 assignment (see <a href="#S6.F17" title="In 6.2 Decentralised learning over Barabási-Albert graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>).

As such, some nodes are able to reach higher values of accuracy (see case <math id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m=2" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">m</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑚</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">m=2</annotation></semantics></math>). The reasoning is the same as for the ER networks: the nodes with high clustering coefficient tend to keep the information locally, whereas the ones with low clustering coefficient spread it more broadly if they have also a high degree. This spreading results in higher variability.

We can see that the difference decreases as we increase the number of connections in the graphs (i.e. going from left to right). This is easily explained by looking at the characteristics of the topology of the two types of graphs. The Barabási-Albert graph, in fact, is a graph that exhibits a heavy tail in the degree distribution, meaning that it has few nodes with high degree and many nodes with low degree. This means that the high degree nodes are well connected in the graph and can exert their influence much more efficiently than the Erdős-Rényi counterpart. On the other hand, the Erdős-Rényi graph is a random graph, thus the nodes with high degree are not necessarily well connected inside the graph. However, this difference gets smaller as we increase the mean number of connections: all nodes in general enjoy a better connectivity, hence the network can compensate for the lack of strong hubs.</p>

This can be confirmed by looking at the algebraic connectivity of the graphs (<a href="#S6.T3" title="In 6.3.1 Degree centrality ‣ 6.3 ER vs BA comparison ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). Algebraic connectivity is a measure of the connectedness of a graph. A graph with high algebraic connectivity is well-connected and can quickly spread information, while a graph with low algebraic connectivity can only spread information slowly. The higher the algebraic connectivity, the higher the number of paths for information to travel through the graph.

Recall that each community holds two non-overlapping MNIST classes (hence, classes 8 and 9 are discarded). Using only intracommunity information, nodes can at most achieve a 0.25 accuracy (perfect classification of the two classes in their training data, zero knowledge on the other six). In order to go beyond 0.25, knowledge must be circulated across communities. In these settings we are interested in analysing (i) whether the sporadic edges between communities are sufficient for exchanging the knowledge built intra-community and (ii) to what extent the external knowledge permeates through the communities.

<p id="S6.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we explored the impact of conducting multiple local training epochs on the dissemination of information within the community.
The objective was to determine whether a high number of local training epochs in between global updates might negatively impact the information diffusion when communities are tightly knitted. To examine this, we conducted a simulation under identical conditions as in the original experiment but with significantly fewer local training epochs per communication round: specifically, we reduced it to 5 local training epochs as opposed to the original 100. The results, presented in <a href="#S6.F33" title="In 6.4 Decentralised learning over Stochastic Block Model graphs ‣ 6 Results ‣ Impact of network topology on the performance of Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">33</span></a>, reveal a pattern consistent with the original findings. This suggests that the challenge of information propagation within the community is not inherent to the local training phase but is primarily influenced by structural properties of the network as well as by the correlation between data classes.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fully decentralized learning is becoming increasingly interesting from a research perspective, as it enables the training of AI models at the edge of the Internet. This approach helps alleviate issues related to data and bandwidth burdens on the infrastructure, latency, the necessity for continuous and reliable Internet connectivity, and also addresses principles of data locality and privacy. However, learning in a fully decentralized manner poses significant challenges that researchers have yet to fully address. In this work, we focus on one of these challenges, specifically the interplay between the network structure, on which the learning process evolves, and the final performance of the learning itself. For this purpose, we selected three network topologies, each representing a dominant topological property, and six different methods of distributing training data among nodes. Below, we summarize the main findings of this work.</p>
<dl id="S7.I1" class="ltx_description">
<dt id="S7.I1.ix1" class="ltx_item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item"><span id="S7.I1.ix1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Centrality vs neighbourhood density.</span></span></dt>
<dd class="ltx_item">
<div id="S7.I1.ix1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Global centrality metrics directly correlate with the achieved performance of decentralized learning. No significant difference between the two global centrality metrics considered (degree and betweenness) is detected for the topologies we have considered. Vice versa, local clustering is a poor predictor of performance, meaning that belonging to tightly vs loosely knit neighbourhoods does not make any direct difference.</p>

<dt id="S7.I1.ix2" class="ltx_item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item"><span id="S7.I1.ix2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dilution effect.</span></span></dt>
<dd class="ltx_item">
<div id="S7.I1.ix2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Exporting knowledge to central nodes is difficult because they perform model aggregation over a large neighbourhood, where a single “good” model may get diluted into the neighbourhood average.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt id="S7.I1.ix3" class="ltx_item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item"><span id="S7.I1.ix3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Centrality pull effect.</span></span></dt>
<dd class="ltx_item">
<div id="S7.I1.ix3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.I1.ix3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Central nodes pull the others towards their knowledge (i.e., learned model). The centrality pull effect combined with the dilution effect explains why knowledge spreads easily if it originates on central nodes.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt id="S7.I1.ix4" class="ltx_item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item"><span id="S7.I1.ix4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Degree distribution.</span></span></dt>
<dd class="ltx_item">
<div id="S7.I1.ix4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.I1.ix4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The presence of hubs (originating from the Pareto distribution of the degree in BA networks) is a double-edged sword. Hubs can worsen the dilution effect when knowledge is on peripheral nodes but can boost the learning when knowledge is sourced by central nodes. Also, as a side effect of the dilution problem, the lower the average degree, the easier the knowledge spreading from non-central nodes.</p>

<dt id="S7.I1.ix5" class="ltx_item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item"><span id="S7.I1.ix5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Segregated communities.</span></span></dt>
<dd class="ltx_item">
<div id="S7.I1.ix5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.I1.ix5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When users are grouped in segregated communities, it is very difficult for knowledge to circulate outside of the community.</p>
</div>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above summary illustrates the complex interplay between network topology, decentralized learning, and training data distribution. It conveys how a one-size-fits-all approach is not adequate for decentralized learning. This paper lays the groundwork for further studies, where more complex network topologies and network dynamics can be investigated. Moreover, it highlights the need for more nuanced model aggregation strategies, e.g., for mitigating the dilution effect and addressing the resulting unfair treatment of peripheral nodes.</p>
