<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lower potential risks linked to radiation exposure while relying on advanced denoising algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality in reconstructed images. The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model’s ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25% and 10% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A cornerstone in modern medical imaging, CT irradiates the body with a beam of X-rays to furnish detailed cross-sectional views of anatomy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Unlike conventional radiography, CT relies on acquisition of multiple snapshots as the X-ray beam is rotated around the body, causing substantially elevated exposure to ionizing radiation with potential risks including cancer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A mainstream approach to alleviate these health risks involves CT protocols that cap the tube current or exposure time to lower the number of incident photons and thereby the radiation dose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scales with the number of incident photons, dose reduction inevitably increases the noise component in CT images, significantly degrading image quality and potentially obscuring diagnostic features. Consequently, development of effective denoising methods is imperative to maintaining the diagnostic utility of LDCT images acquired under high dose reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The success of a denoising method inherently depends on its ability to separate noise components from tissue signals. Note that tissues in a given cross-sectional view can be broadly distributed across contiguous or segregated clusters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, so tissue signals exhibit both local and global correlations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, the noise variance in LDCT images scales with the intensity of the tissue signal, so the noise component can also show a degree of local and global correlations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Thus, an effective denoising method should be able to discern unique patterns of contextual features that distinguish the noise component from tissue signals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, learning-based methods rooted in deep neural network models have replaced traditional approaches in LCDT denoising <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, given their ability to adapt to the distribution of imaging data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Earlier studies in this domain have predominantly employed CNN-based models to process noisy LDCT images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Several architectural improvements have also been posed over basic CNNs to boost performance, including use of residual connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and edge-sharpening convolutions to alleviate spatial smoothing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and use of multi-scale networks to enhance capture of short- and long-range context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Commonly, these CNN models employ compact convolutional filters for image processing, enabling them to benefit from linear model complexity with respect to image dimensions, and high expressiveness for local contextual features that are critical in delineating detailed tissue structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. However, the locality bias of convolutional filters inevitably restricts sensitivity to long-range contextual features in LDCT images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. As such, CNNs can suffer from poor denoising performance especially near regions of heterogeneous tissue composition, where understanding contextual relationships is crucial for distinguishing signal from noise.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A recent alternative to CNNs are transformer-based models that employ self-attention operators in place of convolutional filters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Transformers process images as a sequence of tokens (i.e., image patches), and perform non-local filtering via self-attention for improved sensitivity to long-range contextual features. At the same time, however, such non-local filtering induces quadratic model complexity with respect to sequence length <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. A common approach to mitigate complexity has been to split the image into relatively large-sized patches, which naturally limits spatial precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. A number of strategies have been considered to address this limitation, including architectures with separate branches for low- and high-frequency image components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, architectures with edge enhancing filters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, hybrid CNN-transformer architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, and pyramidal transformer architectures with implicit biases from CNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, and dual-attention architectures have been developed to effectively process various features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Note that despite their relatively improved efficiency, these variant transformer models can still be more complex than CNNs, thus suffering from suboptimal learning on modest-sized training datasets. An emerging framework to capture long-range context under linear complexity employs state-space models (SSM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Recent medical imaging studies have reported promising results based on a selective SSM variant (Mamba) in downstream tasks such as segmentation and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Yet, the potential of SSMs for image denoising in LDCT remains unexplored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Here we introduce a novel SSM-based model, DenoMamba, to achieve improved performance in LDCT image denoising without elevating model complexity. DenoMamba leverages an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages constructed with novel FuseSSM blocks (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Each FuseSSM block convolutionally fuses the spatial context captured by a spatial SSM module with the channel context captured by a novel channel SSM module. The proposed channel SSM module employs a secondary gated convolution network following the SSM layer in order to extract latent hidden features of channel context. Meanwhile, to improve preservation of low-level representations in LDCT images, the SSM modules are equipped with residual connections and hierarchical features extracted by encoder stages are projected onto decoder stages via long-range residual connections. These building blocks empower DenoMamba to capture both short- and long-range contextual information in LDCT images, with comparable model complexity to conventional CNNs. Comprehensive evaluations on LDCT datasets acquired with 25% and 10% of nominal radiation doses demonstrate the superior performance of DenoMamba compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many earlier methods in the domain of LDCT denoising have adopted CNN models that process images via compact, shift-invariant convolutional filters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The implicit locality bias of convolutional filters enables CNNs to attain computational efficiency, learn effectively from modest size datasets, and offer high sensitivity to short-range contextual features in medical images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Yet, vanilla CNNs also manifest a number of key limitations; and a number of architectural improvements have been sought over the years to address them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. To improve learning and denoising performance, residual connections have been included in an autoencoder architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To improve preservation of detailed tissue structure in denoised images, models that separately process low- and high-frequency image components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, models embodying Sobel convolutional layers to emphasize tissue boundaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and multi-scale models that fuse features extracted at different scales have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. To lower model complexity without compromising performance, autoencoder architectures based on quadratic neurons have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To improve realism in denoised CT images, generative adversarial models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models  have been considered. To enhance denoising performance near rare pathology, multiplicative attention layers have been embedded in CNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>. While these advancements have helped push the performance envelope in LDCT denoising, CNN models often struggle to capture long-range contextual features in medical images due to the locality bias of convolutional filters.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an alternative to CNNs, recent studies have introduced transformer models that instead process images via non-local, shift-variant self-attention filters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Driven by the similarities between all possible pairs of image tokens regardless of their spatial distance, self-attention filters enable transformers to offer exceptional sensitivity to not only short-range but also long-range contextual features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. Yet, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image size has limited the spatial precision at which transformers can be utilized. A group of studies have proposed hybrid CNN-transformer backbones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, dilated transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and windowed transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> that alleviate model complexity by lowering feature maps dimensions that are provided to the transformer modules. However, these previous models inevitably diminish the sensitivity benefits of transformers for long-range contextual features towards relatively high spatial resolutions. Aiming to alleviate such losses in spatial precision, models that separately process low- and high-frequency image components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>, models that use Sobel convolutional filters or gradient maps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, models that employ edge enhancement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, and segmented models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have been proposed. That said, it remains a significant challenge in transformer-based method to maintain sensitivity to long-range context in high-resolution LDCT images, without introducing prohibitive computational burden.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SSMs are an emerging framework in machine learning, offering the ability to capture long-range context without the significant computational demands of transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. Building on this framework, several recent medical imaging studies have devised SSM-based models for challenging tasks such as segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, synthesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, and landmark detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> with promising results. Yet, to our knowledge, the potential of SSMs in medical image denoising has not been previously explored. Here, we introduce DenoMamba as the very first SSM-based model for LDCT denoising in the literature. Our proposed model employs a novel architecture comprising FuseSSM blocks, which extract contextual features in the channel dimension via a channel SSM module, contextual features in the spatial dimension via a spatial SSM module, and merges these contextual features with low-level representations in input feature maps via a convolutional fusion module. As such, DenoMamba comprehensively models contextual features in LDCT images and maintains high spatial precision without the burdening computational overhead of transformer-based methods.</p>

Each FuseSSM block comprises a channel SSM module, a spatial SSM module, and a CFM module. <span id="S2.F2.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(a)</span> The channel SSM module performs convolutional encoding of image tokens after layer normalization, and processes the transposed feature map via an SSM layer to capture an initial set of contextual features across the channel dimension. To further extract a second set of latent features, this initial set is projected through a gated convolutional network, and the two sets of contextual features are residually combined. <span id="S2.F2.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(b)</span> The spatial SSM modules performs convolutional encoding of image tokens after layer normalization, and processes the feature map via an SSM layer to capture contextual features across the spatial dimension. <span id="S2.F2.7.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(c)</span> The CFM module pools original input features along with contextual features from the channel and spatial SSM modules, and fuses them via convolutional layers.</figcaption>

In learning-based methods, this is attempted with a neural network model that is trained to map noisy LDCT images onto denoised images that would be consistent with a normal dose CT (NDCT) scan.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DenoMamba is the first LDCT image denoising method in the literature that uses SSMs to model spatial and channel context, to our knowledge. It employs a novel architecture based on FuseSSM blocks, which serve to capture a comprehensive set of contextual features across spatial and channel dimensions, while maintaining favorable balance in model complexity. In the following subsections, we describe the overall model architecture and the inner structure of FuseSSM blocks in detail.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p6.4" class="ltx_p">Note that many layers in DenoMamba can perform spatial encoding, such as the depth-wise convolutional layers in FuseSSM blocks and downsampling/upsampling layers across encoder/decoder stages. Collectively, these layers can learn a hierarchy of latent features of spatial context. Yet, channel encoding is primarily performed in the state-space layers of the channel SSM module, limiting the information captured on channel context. To address this limitation, here we propose a novel channel SSM module that incorporates a gated convolution network to extract latent features of channel context. For this purpose, a gating variable is first computed:</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Demonstrations of denoising performance were conducted on datasets derived from the 2016 NID-AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge, comprising contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans obtained 70 s after administration of iodinated contrast agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Separate datasets were considered based on two different dose reduction levels, resulting in 25% and 10% radiation dose with respect to nominal values. Normal dose CT (NDCT) scans were acquired at 120 kV reference tube potential with 200 effective mAs as quality reference radiation dose. Meanwhile, LDCT at 25% radiation dose assumed 50 effective mAs, and LDCT at 10% radiation dose assumed 20 effective mAs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Dose reduction in LDCT scans was attained by adding Poisson noise onto NDCT images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For both 25%-dose and 10%-dose datasets, the training and validation sets were formed by reconstructing CT images at 1-mm slice thickness. A total of 760 cross-sectional NDCT-LDCT image pairs from 9 subjects were included in the training set, and 35 image pairs from 1 subject were included in the validation set. Meanwhile, the test set was formed by reconstructing four different sets of CT images based on two distinct kernels (Siemens B30 and D45), and two distinct slice thicknesses (1 mm and 3 mm), resulting in multiple parameter combinations: B30-1mm, D45-1mm, B30-3mm, and D45-3mm.

A ‘w/o cha. SSM’ variant was formed by ablating the channel SSM module from FuseSSM blocks. A ‘w/o spa. SSM’ variant was formed by ablating the spatial SSM module from FuseSSM blocks. A ‘w/o CFM’ variant was formed by replacing the channel fusion module in FuseSSM blocks with a simple element-wise addition operator to combine contextual features from spatial/channel SSM modules with original input features. A ‘w/o GCN’ variant was formed by ablating the gated convolutional network in channel SSM modules that extracts latent contextual features across the channel dimension.

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we demonstrated DenoMamba via comparisons against several state-of-the-art methods from the LDCT denoising literature. Specifically, competing methods included CNN models (RED-CNN, N2N, EDCNN), transformer models (Uformer, LIT-Former), GAN models (WGAN, DU-GAN), an autoencoder model (QAE), and a diffusion model (IDDPM). Experiments were first conducted on the 25%-dose dataset to recover high-quality images from LDCT measurements. Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> lists performance metrics for competing methods separately for a test set comprising 1-mm thick slices, a test set comprising 3-mm thick slices, and an aggregated test set comprising both slice thicknesses. In each individual setting for the test set, we find that DenoMamba significantly outperforms all competing methods (p<math id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><lt id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math>0.05). On average, DenoMamba achieves performance improvements of 0.6dB PSNR, 0.2% SSIM, 0.6% RMSE over CNNs; 1.7dB PSNR, 0.7% SSIM, 1.5% RMSE over transformers; 2.8dB PSNR, 2.4% SSIM, 2.8% RMSE over GANs; 1.6dB PSNR, 1.2% SSIM, 1.5% RMSE over the autoencoder; 1.7dB PSNR, 0.5% SSIM, 1.4% RMSE over the diffusion model. Representative denoised images recovered by competing methods are displayed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Modeling Procedures ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Among baselines, CNN models are generally effective in suppressing local noise patterns within homogeneous tissue regions, albeit they are suboptimal in alleviating noise patterns that extend over longer distances, occasionally inducing perturbations in tissue contrast deviating from ground truth NDCT images. Contrarily, transformers with their enhanced sensitivity to long-range context are better at preserving contrast across heterogeneous tissue regions, but they suffer from residual local noise patterns that manifest as signal intensity fluctuations in homogeneous tissue regions. Although GAN models maintain the highest visual sharpness, this comes at the expense of high levels of residual noise in recovered images. Meanwhile, the autoencoder model shows a degree of spatial blurring, and the diffusion model suffers from inaccuracies in tissue contrast and suboptimal noise suppression. In comparison to baselines, DenoMamba recovers high-quality CT images with reliable suppression of local and global noise patterns, and accurate depiction of tissue structure and contrast.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also conducted experiments on the 10%-dose dataset to assess competing methods at a relatively more challenging denoising task. Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Results ‣ DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> lists performance metrics for competing methods separately for a test set comprising 1-mm thick slices, a test set comprising 3-mm thick slices, and an aggregated test set comprising both slice thicknesses. Corroborating the findings on the 25%-dose dataset, we find that DenoMamba significantly outperforms all competing methods consistently across all examined settings (p<math id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><lt id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math>0.05). On average, DenoMamba achieves performance improvements of 0.9dB PSNR, 0.5% SSIM, 1.1% RMSE over CNNs; 1.7dB PSNR, 2.1% SSIM, 2.1% RMSE over transformers; 2.3dB PSNR, 2.0% SSIM, 2.9% RMSE over GANs; 1.3dB PSNR, 0.,9% SSIM, 1.7% RMSE over the autoencoder; 1.6dB PSNR, 1.4% SSIM, 1.9% RMSE over the diffusion model. Representative denoised images recovered by competing methods are displayed in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison Studies ‣ 5 Results ‣ DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Note that, at the higher 10% dose reduction level, additive Poisson noise becomes more prominent, yielding spatially-correlated perturbations in LDCT images comparable to native variations in tissue signals. Since distinguishing noise-driven perturbations from actual variations in tissue signals become more challenging, the difficulty of the LDCT denoising task is elevated. We observe that both CNNs and transformers start to suffer from residual noise patterns in locally homogeneous tissue regions, lowering structural accuracy particularly in the vicinity of tissue boundaries. As GAN models intend to maintain high-spatial frequency information in recovered images, they suffer from high levels of residual noise patterns. The autoencoder model shows visible residual noise. While the diffusion models yields generally higher image quality in comparison to other baselines, it suffers from a degree of structural inaccuracy in depiction of detailed tissue structures. Contrarily, DenoMamba offers high-fidelity depiction of detailed tissue structure in CT images with visibly improved noise suppression.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we introduced a novel denoising method to recover high-quality NDCT images from noisy LDCT images. Previous CNN models offer computationally efficiency denoising and higher local precision, albeit they are relatively insensitive to long-range relationships between distant anatomical regions in medical images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. While transformer models can address this limitations by leveraging the long-range contextual sensitivity of the self-attention mechanism, they inherently suffer from quadratic model complexity with respect to sequence length, which common approaches to alleviate this complexity result in inevitable losses in spatial precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>. Differently from these previous models, DenoMamba employs novel FuseSSM blocks to capture contextual features via state-space modeling across spatial and channel dimensions, while enjoying similar computational efficiency to CNN models. Our demonstrations indicate that DenoMamba achieves superior performance in LDCT denoising against state-of-the-art CNN and transformer methods, with apparent quantitative and qualitative benefits in recovered CT images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several technical limitations can be addressed in order to further boost the performance and practicality of DenoMamba. A first line concerns the nature of denoising tasks used for model training. Here, a separate model was trained for LDCT denoising at each reduction level for radiation dose to maintain high performance. Note that this may lower practicality if highly variable reduction levels are expected to be administered in practice. In those cases, DenoMamba can be trained on LDCT images at varying reduction levels, and model specialization to specific radiation doses could be enhanced by adaptive normalization approaches on feature maps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>. This could improve practicality by building a unified model that can be deployed at various dose reduction levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A second line of improvements concerns the datasets on which DenoMamba is trained to perform LDCT denoising. Here, we performed supervised learning relying on the availability of paired LDCT-NDCT images from the same set of subjects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>. Note that, in practice, the curation of such paired datasets can be challenging as it would require repeated CT scans on a given subject at separate radiation doses. In cases where the amount of paired training data that can be collected is limited, a large training set can be curated by instead adopting cycle-consistent learning procedures on unpaired sets of LDCT and NDCT images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>, or self-supervised learning procedures to train models directly on LDCT measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, models can be pre-trained for denoising in a domain with abundant data (e.g., natural images), and then transfered to the LDCT domain via fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A third line of improvements concerns the loss terms employed to train DenoMamba. Here, we utilized a simple pixel-wise loss term based on mean-squared error, since we observed that this pixel-wise loss offered effective learning of LDCT denoising models on the examined datasets. That said, it might be possible to attain further improvements in recovered image quality by using more sophisticated loss terms including adversarial, score-based or cross-entropy losses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite>. Particularly within the context of score-based methods that involve iterative sampling procedures, the long-range contextual sensitivity of DenoMamba might offer benefits over conventional score-based models based on CNN backbones. Further work is warranted for a systematic evaluation of the utility of various loss functions on the performance and reliability of DenoMamba.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here we introduced a fused state-space model (SSM) for recovery of high-quality images from noisy LDCT measurements. The proposed DenoMamba model leverages an hourglass architecture implemented with novel FuseSSM blocks. Each FuseSSM block extracts contextual features across spatial and channel dimensions via spatial and channel SSM modules, respectively, and performs fusion of contextual and original input features via a CFM module. This design enables DenoMamba to leverage contextual relationships in LDCT images without elevating computational burden, and to offer superior performance against state-of-the-art LDCT denoising methods. Therefore, DenoMamba holds great promise for performant and efficient LDCT image denoising.</p>
