<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of imaging sensor technology in the field of remote sensing, multi-modal remote sensing data fusion has emerged as a crucial research direction for land cover classification tasks. While diffusion models have made great progress in generative models and image classification tasks, existing models primarily focus on single-modality and single-client control, that is, the diffusion process is driven by a single modal in a single computing node. To facilitate the secure fusion of heterogeneous data from clients, it is necessary to enable distributed multi-modal control, such as merging the hyperspectral data of organization A and the LiDAR data of organization B privately on each base station client. In this study, we propose a multi-modal collaborative diffusion federated learning framework called FedDiff. Our framework establishes a dual-branch diffusion model feature extraction setup, where the two modal data are inputted into separate branches of the encoder. Our key insight is that diffusion models driven by different modalities are inherently complementary in terms of potential denoising steps on which bilateral connections can be built. Considering the challenge of private and efficient communication between multiple clients, we embed the diffusion model into the federated learning communication structure, and introduce a lightweight communication module. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the superiority of our framework in terms of image quality and conditional consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of deploying a diffusion model into a federated learning framework, achieving optimal both privacy protection and performance for heterogeneous data. Our FedDiff surpasses existing methods in terms of performance on three multi-modal datasets, achieving a classification average accuracy of 96.77<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> while reducing the communication cost.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of deep learning technology in the field of remote sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, imaging satellite data has made significant progress in ground object classification tasks, opening up new possibilities for land use and urban mapping. For instance, hyperspectral satellites enable the collection of continuous spectral features, thereby facilitating high-precision land cover classification. However, single-mode satellite data has limitations. Hyperspectral satellites often struggle to provide accurate structural information, especially in the presence of extensive cloud coverage or atmospheric interference. This is where LiDAR data becomes invaluable, as it can offer surface height information, ground structure details, and other complementary data, enhancing the comprehensiveness and accuracy of remote sensing applications.
Due to the ever-expanding availability and resolution of satellite remote sensing data, more and more Earth observation satellites are able to collect multi-modal images of the same area simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
By fusing information from different data modalities, a better understanding and analysis of surface characteristics can be achieved, thereby greatly benefiting earth observation, environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster response efforts.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There has been noteworthy progress in the fusion of multi-modal remote sensing data for remote sensing surface object classification. A more compact feature representation can be obtained by combining the spectral information from hyperspectral satellites with elevation information from LiDAR. In the context of multi-modal data fusion methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often employed as they effectively capture the local structural information present in images. For instance, Ding <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed a novel global-local conversion network for the joint classification of HSI and LiDAR data. Their approach fully mines and combines the complementary information of multi-modal data and local/global spectral-spatial information. Afterward, some advanced deep learning algorithms were used in multi-modal data fusion research.
Xiong <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed an interpretable fusion siamese network (IFSN) to solve the multi-modality remote sensing ship image retrieval (MRSSIR).
Roy <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> introduced a multi-modal fusion transformer network that leverages multi-modal data as external classification markers for the transformer encoder to enhance generalization capabilities. Additionally, Zhao <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> presented a fusion algorithm based on the denoising diffusion probability model. Their method formulates the fusion task as a conditional generation problem within the DDPM sampling framework, yielding impressive results in infrared-visible light image fusion. By combining different imaging techniques in remote sensing, various properties of the Earth’s surface, such as spectral radiation, reflectance, height information, texture structure, and spatial features, can be captured. Leveraging multiple modalities enables a more detailed and precise description of the scene, which is not achievable through single-modality data alone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, there are still two problems in the current multimodal fusion scheme. First, the current multimodal remote sensing lacks consideration from the characteristics of remote sensing data, that is, the current feature extraction only considers from the perspective of spaital and spectral, and lacks analysis from the perspective of frequency domain analysis. However, frequency domain filtering can enhance or remove specific ground features of remote sensing images by analyzing components of specific frequencies. Second, due to the limitation of data transmission and storage cost, the current fusion process mainly relies on performing fusion and computation on a single server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, with the continuous development of low-orbit satellites, more and more countries and organizations are collaborating to achieve remote sensing missions for collaborative fusion among multiple satellites. However, in multi-satellite distributed systems, certain types of data inherently contain sensitive information. Public access is limited to level-1 or higher products for spaceborne data, while level-0 data is subject to privacy protection laws <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Several jurisdictions have implemented data protection regulations, such as the GDPR, that impose strict restrictions on sharing privacy-sensitive data between clients and platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Traditionally, raw data is transmitted between various terrestrial base stations, posing a risk of potential exposure of sensitive information to attackers during the transmission process. This not only compromises privacy protection between satellites but also raises concerns about data integrity and security. Hence, the safe and efficient processing of source data remains a significant challenge for remote sensing multi-modal fusion. Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning technology that breaks data silos, offers a promising solution. It enables participants to achieve joint modeling by exchanging machine learning intermediate results without disclosing the underlying data, thereby providing enhanced federated feature fusion for terrestrial base station systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A pivotal question that arises in distributed multi-modal fusion tasks is whether it is possible to construct a unified network that simultaneously ensures private communication and efficient fusion, leading to improved classification performance. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic investigation of various structures and propose a network architecture based on three fundamental properties: (1) The fused features preserve the salient features of each modality in the spatial and frequency domains. (2) Lightweight communication facilitates the transmission of data across multiple clients. (3) Each client ensures privacy of the original data during communication. Diffusion models driven by different modalities are inherently complementary regarding the latent denoising steps, where bilateral connections can be established upon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Inspired by this, we expect to effectively merge the features of remote sensing HSI and LiDAR images using a dual-branch co-diffusion network. It enables us to leverage information complementarity and obtain improved results for remote sensing surface object classification. In summary, we propose a federated learning framework for the diffusion model, which enables model training and lightweight data fusion on each client while ensuring data privacy. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the face of the ever-growing complexity and diversity in remote sensing scene representation requirements, multi-modal deep learning serves as an effective approach to enhance the accuracy of overall decision-making results by leveraging the characteristics of different modal data. The multi-modal fusion method is the core content of multi-modal deep learning technology. According to the fusion stage, it can be divided into early fusion, feature-level fusion, and late fusion methods. In order to alleviate the inconsistency problem between the original data in each modality, the representation of features can be extracted from each modality separately, and then fused at the feature level, known as feature fusion. Since deep learning essentially involves learning specific representations of features from raw data, which sometimes requires data fusion before features are extracted, both feature-level and data-level fusions are called early fusion. For example, Audebert <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed an early fusion network based on the FuseNet principle to jointly learn more substantial multi-modality features. He <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> presented a hypergraph parser to imitate guiding perception to learn intra-modal object-wise relationships. Hong <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed the classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data through deep encoder-decoder network architecture. The late fusion method, also known as decision-level fusion, involves training separate deep learning models for different modalities and subsequently combining the output results from multiple models. For example, P. Bellmann <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a sample-specific late-fusion classification architecture to improve performance accuracy. The hybrid fusion method combines the early and late fusion approaches, leveraging the strengths of both methods while also introducing increased structural complexity and training challenges to the model. In multi-modal remote sensing data fusion, network layer fusion shows better competitiveness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, from the perspective of model structure, the framework for remote sensing multi-modal classification can be broadly categorized into traditional models, classic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer models, and diffusion models. In terms of conventional model, Guo <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed the potential of using support vector machine (SVM) and random fores to estimate forest above-ground biomass through multi-source remote sensing data.
Despite their great success, traditional methods usually exhibit poor generality under different conditions due to their limited ability to construct strong feature representations and derive scene-dependent fusion strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
For classical convolutional networks, Fang <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed the integration of a spatial-spectral enhancement module (S2EM) into deep neural networks to facilitate cross-modal information interaction. The S2EM comprises two components: the SpAtial Enhancement Module (SAEM) and the SpEctral Enhancement Module (SEEM). In terms of Transformer architecture, Hoffmann <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a new Synchronized Class Token Fusion (SCT Fusion) architecture, which handles different input modalities by leveraging a modality-specific attention-based Transformer encoder, and the inter-modal information exchange is carried out by synchronizing the special class token after each Transformer encoder block. Remote sensing image classification necessitates the consideration of spatial information within the image, as the spatial distribution and contextual relationships of ground objects significantly influence the classification outcomes. CNNs are widely adopted in image classification tasks due to their excellent feature extraction capabilities. However, traditional CNN models do not explicitly account for the spatial relationships between pixels, which may limit their effectiveness in remote sensing image classification. On the other hand, the transformer model primarily excels in processing sequence data, such as sentences in natural language processing. Although the Transformer model can capture long-range dependencies within sequential data, for remote sensing image classification, spatial dependencies hold greater importance. Consequently, the Transformer model is not typically considered the primary choice for this specific task.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant attention within the deep learning community. These models excel at generating high-quality images by simulating the intricate diffusion process that effectively restores noise-corrupted images to their pristine state. Diffusion models have been applied to various fields such as image superresolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In the domain of multi-modal fusion, Huang <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduced collaborative diffusion as a novel approach for achieving multi-modal face generation and editing. Unlike traditional methods that require re-training of models, the proposed approach leverages pre-trained single-modal diffusion models to achieve multi-modal face generation and editing. Furthermore, Dif-Fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> employed diffusion models to generate the distribution of multi-channel input data, thereby enhancing the capability of aggregating multi-source information and maintaining color fidelity. Despite the satisfactory outcomes achieved by these methods, it is worth noting that current diffusion models employed in remote sensing classification fail to consider the manifold structure of high-dimensional data, which can have ramifications on decision-making accuracy.</p>

This framework is specifically designed for training deep learning models on remote devices or isolated data centers while preserving data localization. In the applications scenarios of federated learning, it is common for each edge device to acquire data that is highly non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). For instance, satellites of various types, such as hyperspectral, LiDAR, and SAR satellites, often carry sensors that capture diverse data types. Moreover, the number of datapoints across devices may vary significantly, and there may be an underlying statistical structure present that captures the relationship among devices and their associated distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This data generation paradigm violates the independent and identically distributed (IID) assumption often used in distributed optimization. This departure from the IID assumption can potentially introduce complexities in problem modeling, theoretical analysis, and empirical evaluation of solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Several studies have focused on developing efficient Federated Learning (FL) algorithms to address non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data scenarios. Notable works include FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> can be seen as a generalization and reparametrization of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. It introduced proximal terms to ensure the aggregation of partial information that has not completed calculations and tackles the challenge of data heterogeneity both theoretically and empirically. FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> presented a comprehensive framework for analyzing the convergence of federated heterogeneous optimization algorithms. It automatically adjusts aggregate weights and effective local steps based on local progress. However, these studies may lack generalizability in simulating Non-IID datasets and may not fully cover all variations of Non-IID scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated networks, communication serves as a critical bottleneck <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Due to limited bandwidth, energy, and power resources, network communication can be orders of magnitude slower compared to local computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. To address this, two key aspects must be considered: (1) Reducing the total number of communication rounds. (2) Minimizing the size of transmitted information per round. Compression schemes, such as enforcing sparsity and low-rank properties in the update model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, or utilizing structured random rotations for quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, can significantly reduce the volume of messages transmitted per round. Additionally, employing local update methods can effectively decrease the total number of communication rounds. Dai <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposed high-performance distributed machine learning at a large scale by parameter server consistency models. Also, not every device needs to be involved in every iteration of the training process. Ren <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposed a local-global federation averaging algorithm that combines local representation learning and global model federation training to improve the model’s flexibility in handling heterogeneous data. However, these methods spend much effort extracting heterogeneous data features, and most of the architectures are based on edge-side devices. Therefore, it is significant to mine the heterogeneous feature information of remote sensing images to improve classification accuracy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Taking inspiration from multi-modal cross-fusion techniques, FedDiff adopts the HSI/LiDAR diffusion dual-branch framework. This approach aims to enhance the model’s performance by reusing output feature maps from different modalities. Such integration proves advantageous in processing heterogeneous data obtained from various sensors within a federated environment, leading to improved intelligent interpretation ability through better information fusion.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.3" class="ltx_p">Based on the aforementioned analysis, it is evident that training a neural network to predict the noise introduced during the forward diffusion process is crucial for noise removal in the reverse diffusion process. Each noise step size corresponds to varying levels of texture features. Consequently, we incorporate multi-scale fusion noise as the input for our model, as follows:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the sake of simplicity, we illustrate the federated learning framework using two clients as an example, namely the HSI data client and the LiDAR data client. The data in the clients is Non-IID. Our feature fusion framework enables multiple parties to collaboratively train deep learning models using data from different modalities, without transmitting original data between participants. To be specific, the server firstly distributes a copy of the model to each client. Subsequently, each client performs the diffusion process using their respective stored HSI/LiDAR data, and then transmits the trained features to other clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.14" class="ltx_p">Remote sensing images of different modalities in the same scene contain different types of features, and downstream tasks are expected to utilize multi-modal features from the upstream diffusion model to optimize efficiency. To achieve this concept, we propose a feature fusion mechanism that combines the intrinsic features of different modal images through feature reuse. This mechanism is simple yet effective. Specifically, we propose two parallel modules, each module obtains high-level features by modulating the current layer. The process can be described as follows:</p>

Given the inherent instability of the communication environment in real situations, it is not feasible to transmit the feature map in every iteration. Instead, we adopt a pragmatic approach by selecting an appropriate communication interval based on the specific situation. Our aim is to minimize the communication cost while ensuring the model’s accuracy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As a typical example of vertical federated learning, remote sensing multi-modal federated learning allows the aggregation of heterogeneous data from each client in the same scene, thereby completing the aggregation of multi-source data. This facilitates the amalgamation of multi-source data. Vertical federated learning classifies based on the feature dimensions of the data and extracts relevant parts of data with different features in the same scenario, effectively improving the feature dimensions of the original dataset. To train the model without transmitting original data, FedDiff leverages network layer feature-level fusion to aggregate and average the local gradients from all clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our FedDiff federated framework, we have observed that while the size of the single-modal data feature map may not be substantial, the communication cost associated with it can become relatively high as the communication cycle increases.
To address this issue, we aim to explore federated optimization algorithms that compress feature maps exchanged between clients to improve federated efficiency.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Taking into account the sparse nature of remote sensing data, we incorporated a low-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that significantly reduces the requirement for transmitting single-modal feature maps. This approach involves conducting random sampling at each client to identify the subspace that captures the crucial structure of the feature map. Subsequently, the feature matrix representation is compressed within this low-rank subspace and reconstructed upon reception after transmission. By employing this method, we effectively minimize the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while preserving the essential information contained within the feature map.

In remote sensing scene classification, we make full use of the redundant characteristics of remote sensing data, perform low-rank decomposition of local features, and use dynamic approximation methods to split the diagonal matrix. Simultaneously, the local features are reduced using a diagonal matrix and transmitted to each client for reassembly. This low-rank representation ensures that ample information is retained, facilitating near-lossless restoration during the image reconstruction process. Consequently, our approach maximizes the utilization of redundant characteristics in remote sensing data to achieve high-fidelity restoration of the image.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the effectiveness of FedDiff in remote sensing feature classification tasks on various datasets, we employed four evaluation indicators: Overall Accuracy (OA), Class Accuracy (CA), Average Accuracy (AA), and Kappa coefficient. OA is a widely used metric that measures the classification accuracy of the model over the entire dataset. CA represents the model’s capability to classify and recognize individual categories within the dataset. AA is an improved version of OA that defines as the average of CA. These two indexes mitigate the influence of an imbalanced number of categories and provides a more precise evaluation of the model’s performance across different categories. Kappa coefficient is an evaluation index that measures the consistency between model prediction results and actual labels in classification tasks. It considers the disparity between the model’s classification accuracy and random predictions, thereby eliminating the impact of chance. The specific formulas for the aforementioned indicators are as follows:</p>

For the three remote sensing datasets, we trained for 300 epochs, the batch size was set to 64, and L2 norm regularization was used to prevent model overfitting. It is worth noting that due to the larger size and increased number of categories in the MUUFL dataset compared to others, it has fewer labels available. Therefore, we set the batch size to 128 and optimized the ReduceLROnPlateau learning rate adjustment strategy.</p>

(2) Multi-modal fusion performed locally using our improved U-Net network. (3) Our FedDiff without MFL framework. (4) Our FedDiff method.

By comparing the data in rows 3 and 4 of Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-B2 Parameter Setting ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics and Parameter Setting ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, it is evident that distributing the network across multiple nodes does not compromise the classification accuracy. Then, to verify the effect of the efficient communication module on the accuracy of the model, ablation experiments were conducted on the MFL framework. The results in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-B2 Parameter Setting ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics and Parameter Setting ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> demonstrate that the inclusion of the MFL framework lead to an improvement in classification accuracy. This improvement can be attributed to the utilization of low-rank decomposition for the features. High-dimensional remote sensing features often contain redundancy, and by employing low-rank decomposition, redundant information can be effectively eliminated, thereby preventing over-fitting of the model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the superiority of FedDiff in remote sensing multi-modal land classification tasks more intuitively, we adopted a visualization technique that assigns a unique color to each category. Firstly, we visualized the classification results of individual categories, specifically include categories 12 (Park lot 1), 14 (Tennis court), and 15 (Running track) on the Houston2013 dataset, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-C1 Validation of the Improved U-Net ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. This visualization demonstrates FedDiff’s clear classification performance on individual categories. Additionally, we present the classification visualization results on the three datasets in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C2 Validation of the MFL Framework ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-D Comparisons with Previous Methods ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, and Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-D Comparisons with Previous Methods ‣ IV Experiments and Analysis ‣ FedDiff: Diffusion Model Driven Federated Learning for Multi-Modal and Multi-Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Traditional classifiers yield varying classification outcomes, and their multi-modal fusion methods solely rely on spectral representations of HSI data, lacking spatial information. As a result, these methods manifest prominent salt-and-pepper noise in the classification maps. In contrast, Transformer (ViT, MFT), with there network architecture emphasizing correlations between adjacent spectra and channels, as well as the ability to transmit position information across layers, produces visually superior classification maps. FedDiff integrates multi-modal heterogeneous data from different clients through an efficient federation framework. By combining frequency domain information to reconstruct high-dimensional features, it effectively reducing the granularity of textures in classification maps, resulting in more diverse and finer express. Overall, FedDiff efficiently performs feature-level fusion of heterogeneous data from various devices, while maintaining low communication cost, thus demonstrating superior results in land use and scene classification applications.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing attention on distributed remote sensing data platforms based on deep learning, multi-clients and multi-modal data fusion has become an indispensable direction. Establishing a unified lightweight diffusion model without losing the manifold data of heterogeneous data is crucial to solve the federated feature fusion problem. In this regard, we propose a multi-modal collaborative diffusion federated learning framework called FedDiff. This framework effectively addresses the challenges of multi-clients and multi-modal fusion in remote sensing object classification tasks, without the need to expose privacy risks due to the transmission of redundant raw data or hinder communications. Extensive experiments are conducted on existing distributed hardware systems, demonstrating exceptional performance on online multi-modal data. We believe that the federated multi-modal learning framework will provide valuable insights for distributed remote sensing tasks.</p>
