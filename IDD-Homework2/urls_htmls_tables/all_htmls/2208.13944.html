<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Accurately annotated image datasets are essential components for studying animal behaviors from their poses. Compared to the number of species we know and may exist, the existing labeled pose datasets cover only a small portion of them, while building comprehensive large-scale datasets is prohibitively expensive. Here, we present a very data efficient strategy targeted for pose estimation in quadrupeds that requires only a small amount of real images from the target animal. It is confirmed that fine-tuning a backbone network with pretrained weights on generic image datasets such as ImageNet can mitigate the high demand for target animal pose data and shorten the training time by learning the the prior knowledge of object segmentation and keypoint estimation in advance. However, when faced with serious data scarcity (i.e., <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;10^{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"></mi><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><msup id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><lt id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1"></lt><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">absent</csymbol><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">&lt;10^{2}</annotation></semantics></math> real images), the model performance stays unsatisfactory, particularly for limbs with considerable flexibility and several comparable parts. We therefore introduce a prior-aware synthetic animal data generation pipeline called PASyn to augment the animal pose data essential for robust pose estimation. PASyn generates a probabilistically-valid synthetic pose dataset, SynAP, through training a variational generative model on several animated 3D animal models. In addition, a style transfer strategy is utilized to blend the synthetic animal image into the real backgrounds. We evaluate the improvement made by our approach with three popular backbone networks and test their pose estimation accuracy on publicly available animal pose images as well as collected from real animals in a zoo<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The SynAP dataset and PASyn code is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ostadabbas/Prior-aware-Synthetic-Data-Generation-PASyn-" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://github.com/ostadabbas/Prior-aware-Synthetic-Data-Generation-PASyn-</a>.</span></span></span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The research on animal pose estimation has grown in recent years, covering 2D/3D pose estimation, animal model recovery, and multi-animal pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yu et al.(2021)Yu, Xu, Zhang, Zhao, Guan, and Tao</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mu et al.(2020)Mu, Qiu, Hager, and Yuille</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li and Lee(2021)</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mathis et al.(2021)Mathis, Biasi, Schneider, Yuksekgonul, Rogers,
Bethge, and Mathis</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zuffi et al.(2019)Zuffi, Kanazawa, Berger-Wolf, and
Black</a>]</cite>. The makeup of the available training sets for the animal pose estimation models divides the study into two branches. The first proposes training the model with significant amounts of labeled real data of a single species.
The other one is based on a small amount of real data of a target animal and more data from other adjacent domains to make up for the data scarcity of the target animal. Current data scarcity solution is centered around learning animals’ common prior knowledge from large amounts of real data of similar species or even humans. Previous research has shown that quadrupeds, including humans, have similar appearances and skeletons, and that knowledge can be shared <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cao et al.(2019)Cao, Tang, Fang, Shen, Lu, and Tai</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sanakoyeu et al.(2020)Sanakoyeu, Khalidov, McCarthy, Vedaldi, and

and Vedaldi</a>]</cite>.
This method is easier to implement after the largest labeled dataset for general animal pose estimation, AP10K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yu et al.(2021)Yu, Xu, Zhang, Zhao, Guan, and Tao</a>]</cite>, was made publicly available in 2021. However, there are restrictions imposed by pose label divergence and the high cost of customization in the existing datasets. In contrast to human, there are huge varieties between animals with different length of bones, number of joints, and extra body parts. Large animal datasets with uniform labeling may leave out the special needs of researchers looking for creatures with unique physical traits.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is another potential choice of adjacent domain for the target animal when aiming for both "inexpensive" and "personalization" aspects. Once the synthetic animal model is built, the label can be defined on the target model and annotating pose data becomes considerably faster and less expensive. In addition to synthetic data, previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mathis et al.(2018)Mathis, Mamidanna, Cury, Abe, Murthy, Mathis, and
Bethge</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yu et al.(2021)Yu, Xu, Zhang, Zhao, Guan, and Tao</a>]</cite> have proven that the backbone networks pre-trained on large general datasets such as ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Deng et al.(2009)Deng, Dong, Socher, Li, Li, and
Fei-Fei</a>]</cite> will gain the prior of object segmentation and keypoint prediction. Thus, training even with few frames from the target leads to a high precision pose prediction. However, when there are far fewer images of the target available (e.g. less than 100), the size of the training set is insufficient for a robust model fine-tuning. The accuracy of the model would decrease significantly when facing more actions from free-ranging behaviors, more self or environmental occlusions, and changes in the environment, textures, and shapes.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To account for severe data scarcity and guarantee a high degree of label personalization, we present a cost-effective and generic prior-aware synthetic data generation pipeline, called PASyn, for animals pose estimate tasks that suffer from severe data scarcity. In short, this paper contributions are: (1) designing a novel variational autoencoder (VAE)-based synthetic animal data generation pipeline to generate probabilistically-valid pose data and verifying its performance on several animal pose test sets; (2) blending the synthetic animal images into real backgrounds through style transfer to mitigate the inconsistency between synthetic and real domains; and (3) building a synthetic animal pose (SynAP) dataset through PASyn, containing 3,000 zebra images and extending it with the 3,600 images of six common quadrupeds including, cows, dogs, sheep, deer, giraffes, and horses to make SynAP+ dataset; and (4) releasing a new pose-labeled dataset of mountain zebras in zoo.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It has been almost ten years since the early animal pose estimation work introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Vicente and Agapito(2013)</a>]</cite>. Yet, the performance of these models is still far inferior to the human pose estimation in terms of accuracy, cross-domain adaptation, and model robustness. This is mainly due to a lack of real-world data, which is the challenge for almost all animal pose estimation work.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most common statement in animal pose estimation articles is the lack of labeled dataset for training, which has been mentioned in many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wu et al.(2020)Wu, Buchanan, Whiteway, Schartner, Meijer, Noel,

Couzin</a>]</cite>. Numerable variety of species and subspecies, and considerable differences in physical characteristics and behavior patterns between them cause it difficult to form a labeled dataset with adequate samples. The cross-domain adaptation challenge exacerbates the situation. For each new animal, it is necessary to collect data from scratch and label them, since it is insufficient to learn the prior knowledge exclusively from the data of other animals. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cao et al.(2019)Cao, Tang, Fang, Shen, Lu, and Tai</a>]</cite> proposed a cross-domain adaptive method and a large multi-species dataset, Animal-Pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jinkun et al.(2019)Jinkun, Hongyang, Hao-Shu, Xiaoyong, Cewu, and

pose prediction as animals in-domain when facing unseen species.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is a promising substitute for real data in previous works. Coarse prior can be learnt and then it would be used to build pseudo-labels for enormous amounts of unlabeled real animal data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mu et al.(2020)Mu, Qiu, Hager, and Yuille</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li and Lee(2021)</a>]</cite>. The fly in the ointment is that works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mu et al.(2020)Mu, Qiu, Hager, and Yuille</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">Li and Lee(2021)</a>]</cite> still use significant amounts of real data (such as TigDog dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Pero et al.(2016)Pero, Susanna, Rahul, and Vittorio</a>]</cite>) in training, which may not be possible to access for the unseen species.

It purposed a general 3D animal model (called SMAL) by learning the animal toys’ scan, and use the SMAL model and a few real pictures to generate a large amount of realistic synthetic data by adjusting the model’s texture, shape, pose, background, camera, and other parameters. They also trained an end-to-end network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zuffi et al.(2019)Zuffi, Kanazawa, Berger-Wolf, and

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although synthetic data has advantages in terms of cost, it still faces the problem of fatal domain gap with the real data, which is even challenging to alleviate by current domain adaptation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ganin et al.(2016)Ganin, Ustinova, Ajakan, Germain, Larochelle,
Laviolette, Marchand, and Lempitsky</a>]</cite>. Pasting synthetic animal directly to the real background will result in the strong incongruity, mainly from the difference in projection, brightness, contrast, saturation, etc., between the two images. This incongruity can lead to excessive domain differences between synthetic and real data. Besides, to increase the texture diversity of synthetic animals to enhance the appearance robustness of the model, a common approach is to assign the synthetic data random textures from ImageNet. However, this further increases the discrepancy between synthetic and real domains and thus weakens the improvement of synthetic data in joint training of pose estimation tasks. The approach to increase model robustness and reduce domain variance by style transfer has been applied in medicine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wagner et al.(2021)Wagner, Khalili, Sharma, Boxberg, Marr, Back, and

To learn the animal pose priors, we use a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. VAE has already been proven to be useful for human pose priors learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">Pavlakos et al.(2019)Pavlakos, Choutas, Ghorbani, Bolkart, Osman,
Tzionas, and Black</a>]</cite>, when it is trained on large-scale 3D human pose datasets. However, appropriate 3D datasets cannot be easily obtained for animal pose studies. Therefore, we feed the animation of multiple simulated animals made by human animators (inexpensively purchased from the CGTrader website), to the VAE, for it to learn the probabilistic distribution of the feasible poses of the targeted animals. Then, the trained VAE is used as a generative model to create our 3D synthetic animal pose (SynAP) dataset. As seen in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Capturing Animal Pose Prior ‣ 3 PASyn Pipeline: Prior-Aware Synthetic Data Generation ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), the legs of quadrupeds like horses and dogs are similar in structure. This structure is obtained by simplifying the leg skeleton. Due to its applicability across quadrupeds, this structure is useful for training animal pose priors. Angles between neighboring bones (12 of them) in the structure shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Capturing Animal Pose Prior ‣ 3 PASyn Pipeline: Prior-Aware Synthetic Data Generation ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(c) are chosen as data for training animal leg pose priors to minimise the influence of model sizes or bone lengths on training.</p>

This process is calculated through the content-aware positional encoding based on the semantics of the image content, thereby eliminating the negative effect of scaling on the spatial relationship between patches. Two transformers are applied to encode the content sequence and style sequence, respectively. Then, a transformer decoder is utilized to decode the encoded content sequence according to the encoded style sequence in a regressive fashion. Finally a convolution-based decoder is used to decode the output sequence, consisting of a linear combination of encoded content and style sequence as well as positional embedding, to obtain the stylized content image <math id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="I^{sty}_{cont}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2.cmml">I</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.3.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.4.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1b" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.5" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.5.cmml">t</mi></mrow><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">t</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1a" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.4" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.4.cmml">y</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.2">𝐼</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3"><times id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.3">𝑡</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.3.4">𝑦</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.3">𝑜</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.4">𝑛</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.5">𝑡</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.6.m6.1c">I^{sty}_{cont}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic Animal Pose (SynAP) dataset contains 3,000 synthetic animal images generated by our prior-aware synthetic animal (PASyn) pipeline. Since zebra was selected as the main species for quantitative evaluation in this work, we collected 5 zebra toys and textured zebra 3D models and synthesized the images from these models with Blender. 3D synthetic model generation pipeline (3D-SMG) introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Vyas et al.(2021)Vyas, Jiang, Liu, and Ostadabbas</a>]</cite> was used to reconstruct two models from zebra toys, while the remaining 3 are adapted from 3D models. In addition to SynAP, which only contains zebra data, SynAP+ extends the SynAP with 3,600 images of 6 other animals, including horses, cows, sheep, dogs, giraffes and deer. We purchased one textured 3D model for each animal from a 3D model website, CGTrader and rendered 600 images for each of the aforementioned animals. The VAE model generates the animal pose in each image and 300 grass, savanna, and forest real scenes are collected from Internet to stylize the synthetic animal.The annotations will be automatically created with each image through calculating the coordinates of each zebra joint in the pose using bone vector transformations.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first describe implementation details of PASyn pipeline and different backbone models which we use to prove its effectiveness in animal pose estimation. In order to achieve a high prediction accuracy on an “unseen” animal in the existing labeled dataset with only a small amount of real data available, we select <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">zebra</span> as the main animal to verify the general effect of our PASyn pipeline on different models and quantify the result with the metric, PCK@0.05. we also perform an ablation study on each part of PASyn pipeline and finally show our model’s generalization capacity on different species including deer, cows, dogs, sheep, horses, and giraffes.</p>

We performed manual animal pose labeling on the cropped and resized images following the label setting of the AP10K dataset. Each label has 17 key points: nose, eyes, neck, shoulders, elbows, front paws, hips, knees, back paws and root of tail. The occlusion of barbed wire makes this dataset more challenging.

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The number of real (R) and synthetic (S) data shown in training set in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> means the total number of images we used for model training. SynAP and SynAP+ are divided into training and validation sets with a ratio of 7 to 1 as the AP10K setting. For real data, considering the data scarcity, we divide it with a ratio of 4 to 1. From Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we can clearly know that only using 99 images for training is insufficient for any backbone network. The highest prediction accuracy is 83.2%, reached by EfficientNet-B6. After adding SynAP to the training set, the prediction results dramatically increase to around 90%. And after adding SynAP+ to the training set, the accuracy is further improved. Among them, HRNet-w32 achieves the highest accuracy of 92.4% when trained with SynAP.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different animals have domain similarity and the possibility of mutual transfer learning, which is proven in many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Cao et al.(2019)Cao, Tang, Fang, Shen, Lu, and Tai</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yu et al.(2021)Yu, Xu, Zhang, Zhao, Guan, and Tao</a>]</cite>. Thus, we cannot ignore the existing labeled data, which can improve the prediction of unseen animal. In Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Pose Estimation Results ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we can see that training the model with 99 zebra images and 8,000 images of the other animals can increase the average PCK from 78.7% to 91.4%. However, Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows that even with only 99 real we are still able to surpass that result and reach SOTA by adding SynAP and SynAP+. Moreover, Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Pose Estimation Results ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> points that the models trained with 8,000 real and SynAP or SynAP+ is further improved to 93.8% and 94.2%. When there is no target animal (i.e., zebra) in the training set, while the state-of-the-art model suffers from this situation (accuracy drops to 78.3%), the model can recover its performance if given the SynAP dataset, as Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Pose Estimation Results ‣ 4 Experimental Analysis ‣ Prior-Aware Synthetic Data to the Rescue: Animal Pose Estimation with Very Limited Real Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows. This confirms that our method can achieve high-precision prediction even for the unseen animals.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a cost-effective and general prior-aware synthetic data generation pipeline (PASyn) for animal pose estimation, for target animal studies that suffer from a severe data scarcity. A probabilistic variational generative model as well as a domain adaptation technique are introduced to increase the validity of the generated poses and to reduce the domain discrepancy between the synthetic and real images. Our synthetic animal pose dataset SynAP and its extended version SynAP+, and the positive effect of them on pose estimation task of animals with a small amount of real data is verified on different backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>
