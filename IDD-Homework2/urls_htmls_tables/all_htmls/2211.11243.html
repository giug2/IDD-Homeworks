<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, data heterogeneity among the training datasets on the local clients (a.k.a., Non-IID data) has attracted intense interest in Federated Learning (FL), and many personalized federated learning methods have been proposed to handle it. However, the distribution shift between the training dataset and testing dataset on each client is never considered in FL, despite it being general in real-world scenarios. We notice that the distribution shift (a.k.a., out-of-distribution generalization) problem under Non-IID federated setting becomes rather challenging due to the entanglement between personalized and spurious information.
To tackle the above problem, we elaborate a general dual-regularized learning framework to explore the <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized invariance</span>, compared with the exsiting personalized federated learning methods which are regularized by a single baseline (usually the global model).
Utilizing the personalized invariant features, the developed personalized models can efficiently exploit the most relevant information and meanwhile eliminate spurious information so as to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization performance for each client. Both the theoretical analysis on convergence and OOD generalization performance and the results of extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing federated learning and invariant learning methods, in diverse out-of-distribution and Non-IID data cases.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As data privacy is attached more and more importance to in the field of machine learning, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> (FL) gains increasing attention and dramatic development in recent years.
Federated learning allows the participation of a massive number of data holders (usually called clients) to train the learning models in a collaborative manner. Most importantly, the participating clients can preserve their data locally during the collaborative training process, and hence prevent the leakage of private data. Traditional federated learning approaches develop a shared gloal model by model aggregation to fit all the local datasets, which can work well when the local data instances on clients subjects to independent and identically distribution (IID). Conversely, the Non-IID setting where the local datasets don’t satisfy the IID assumption can degrade the performance (both model accuracy and convergence rate) of the global model dramatically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hsieh et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To settle the challenge of Non-IID data, personalized federated learning (PFL) is proposed to train a personalized model for each client. Contrary to the individually trained local model which is often trapped in overfitting due to the insufficient local data, the personalized model obtains some generalization knowledge from the sever or the cooperation with other clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the exsiting personalized federated learning methods achieve great success recently, we notice that all of them focus on ,the model performance on in-distribution testing dataset. In this way, the produced models can hardly adapt to the scenarios where the testing dataset is out-of-distribution in terms of the training dataset. Here, we refer to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenario as the case where there exists distribution shift between the training and testing dataset. In fact, the out-of-distribution scenario is more genreal and practical in machine learning applications, and has drawn lots of efforts in the literature on OOD generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Arjovsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Sagawa et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Creager et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Ye et al., <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Shen et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Krueger et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021c</a>)</cite>. However, the out-of-distribution generalization problem is mostly studied in centralized setting where all data can be accessed, but has seldom been considered in the federated learning. Although some of the methods designed for centralized setting can be naively applied into the federated learning to generate a shared global model, they cannot cast off the Non-IID data quagmire because the gained model drops the useful information about personalization. In summary, the existing federated learning works can hardly handle the out-of-distribution scenarios, and meanwhile the centralized methods for OOD generalization will be troubled by the Non-IID data even if they can be implemented in federated learning setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">What’s worse, we find that the simple combination of the existing PFL and OOD methods, instead of solving the OOD generalization problem under Non-IID federated setting, will produce much worse performance than the better one of themselves (the finding will be shown and discussed in the experiment part). To handle the challenging OOD problem under Non-IID federated setting, we disscting the data heterogeneity (Non-IID) from two orthogonal perspectives and then introduce a novel concept: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized invariance</span>. The proposed personalized invariance can preserve the personal information, and in the meantime eliminate the spurious information to equip the obtained personalized models with out-of-distribution generalization.
In contrast with the naive combination of PFL and OOD methods which can easily ‘pick up’ the spurious correlation during the process of personalization because of the entanglement of personalized and spurious information, we propose a general learning framework that is regularized by two baselines: global invariance and local invariance. The global invariance can prevent the personalized models from being stuck in overfitting due to the insufficiency of local data. However, global invariance will discard both personalized and spurious information. Therefore, the constraint of local invariance is utilized to exclude the spurious correlation. With the guidance of the designed dual-constraint, the personalized models can effectively exploit personalized invariance to solve the challenging OOD problem for every client in federated setting.

To handle the Non-IID data quagmire, personalized federated learning (PFL) methods have been widely explored in many real-world applications.

However, these methods usually require the FL server to know some statistical information about the local data distributions (e.g., class sizes, mean and standard deviation), which may potentially violate privacy policy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Another line of work designs special client selection mechanisms to simulate homogeneous data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Lyu et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, many model-based PFL methods focus on producing customized model structures or parameters for different clients, which can also be divided into two types: single-model, multiple-model based approaches.
Single-model based methods extended from the conventional FL algorithms like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> combine the optimization of the local models and global model, including: local fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Schneider and Vlachos, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Arivazhagan et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, regularization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(T Dinh et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Hanzely and Richtárik, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Hanzely et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, model mixture

Considering the diversity and inherent relationship of local data, multi-model-based approaches where multiple global models are trained for heterogeneous clients are more reasonable.
Some researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghosh et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Mansour et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Tang et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> propose to train multiple global models at the server, where similar clients are clustered into a group to share the in-distribution generalization knowledge.
Another strategy is to collaboratively train a personalized model without explicit global models, e.g., FedAMP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Huang et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, FedFomo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, MOCHA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, and KT-pFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>. However, all of these works focus on the discrepancy between training data distributions rather than that between training and testing distributions.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem refers to a challenging setting where the testing distribution is unknown and different from the training. In order to deal with the OOD generalization problem, tremendous efforts have been made and vary greatly ranging from causality to representation learning and from
structure-based to optimization-based. The existing methods can be categorized into three parts: unsupervised representation learning (e.g., to analyse causal relationships between data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Schölkopf et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Shen et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>; Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Träuble et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Locatello et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, supervised model learning (e.g., design various model architectures and learning strategies to achieve OOD generalization, including domain generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhao et al., <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Garg et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Du et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, causal &amp; invariant learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gamella and Heinze-Deml, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Oberst et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Krueger et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Kamath et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Arjovsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and stable learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shen et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021c</a>)</cite>) and optimization approaches (focus on distributed robust optimization across different distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021c</a>; Sagawa et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> or capturing invariant features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Chang et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Koyama and Yamaguchi, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>).
All of the above OOD generalization methods are studied in centralized scenarios, where all training data can be accessed. In some real-world applications, the data are usually generated locally and the data owners are not willing to share data with others due to the concern about privacy. Therefore, we are motivated to investigate the OOD generalization problem under the federated setting.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client-level heterogeneity.</span> The distributions of training datasets are usually heterogeneous across the clients.
Since the local data on every client is scarce and of limited diversity, the clients in FL framework need to collaborate to mine the common/generalization knowledge with some shared/global objective. However, the client-level heterogeneity can result in the discrepancy between the optimas of local objective and global objective. In other words, the client-independent representation (i.e., global knowledge) can be biased for some participating clients. Therefore, preserving the personalization information is of great importance for dealing with the client-level data heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Context-level heterogeneity.</span> In addition to the heterogeneity among the training datasets, the heterogeneity between the training and testing dataset is also worthy of attentions. In FL, the local training and testing dataset on each client may be generated in distinct contexts/environments<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In this paper, environment, context and domain are used equivalently.</span></span></span>. For example, the training image samples on a client are mainly captured from the local cameras, while the testing images may come from the web and with different styles. From the perspective of context, the target learning models must be equipped with OOD generalization so that they can perform both well on unknown and distinct contexts.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed above, we can conclude that solving the OOD problem under Non-IID federated setting needs to discover the invariant
representation without dropping the important personalized information. When we consider to implement the distributed version of invariant learning, such as <span id="S3.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IRM</span> and <span id="S3.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GroupDRO</span>, each client can be regarded as an environment. In this way, both the context-specific (i.e., spurious) representation and the client-related (personalized) representation will be treated as spurious representations. Only the common invariant representation across the clients is extracted and utilized to elicit the invariant predictors. Consequently, the important personalized representation is dropped.</p>

The underlying reason is that the local objective with these personalization terms is to minimize the expected loss as long as the target model is not too different from the global model. However, when the realtionship with the global model is satisfied, minimizing the expected loss can readily make the trained model pick up the spurious correlations and hence decrease the performance on OOD testing data. By comparison, the designed dual-regularized optimization in our algorithm contains two constraints: 1) being close/similar to the ‘global invariance’ and 2) satisfying the ‘local invariance’ to exclude the spurious features. Therefore, our method can effectively exploit the personalized information and avoid ‘picking up’ the spurious information concurrently, so as to improve the OOD performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we are the first to investigate the out-of-distribution problem under the Non-IID federated setting. Atfer formally analyzing the challenges, we propose the novel concept <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized invariance</span> which can improve the model performance, by preserving the important personalized information and meanwhile eliminating the spurious correlations. To explore the optimal personalized invariance, we propose a objective: dual-regularization constrained optimization and design a practical algorithm <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PerInvFL</span> to solve it. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art federated learning and invariant learning methods.</p>

<p id="A1.SS4.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For RC-MNIST and RC-FMNIST dataset, we adopt a deep neural network with two hidden layers (the dimension is 390 and 390 respectively) as the feature extractor and an subsequent fully-connected layer (the dimension is 390) as the classifier. Besides, after each haidden layer, there is a ReLU layer in the feature extractor. In the evaluation on WaterBird dataset, we adopt the standard ResNet-18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. [<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite> as learning model. Similarly, the part before the last fully-connected layer works as the feature extractor and the last fully-connected layer works as the classifier, and the output dimension of the feature extractor is 512.</p>
