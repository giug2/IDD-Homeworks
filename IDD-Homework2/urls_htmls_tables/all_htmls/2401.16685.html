<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Multimodal federated learning (FL) aims to enrich model training in FL settings where clients are collecting measurements across multiple modalities.
However, key challenges to multimodal FL remain unaddressed, particularly in heterogeneous network settings where: (i) the set of modalities collected by each client will be diverse, and (ii) communication limitations prevent clients from uploading all their locally trained modality models to the server.
In this paper, we propose <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">m</span>ulti<span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">m</span>odal <span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Fed</span>erated learning with joint <span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">M</span>odality and <span id="id6.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">C</span>lient selection (mmFedMC), a new FL methodology that can tackle the above-mentioned challenges in multimodal settings. The joint selection algorithm incorporates two main components: (a) A modality selection methodology for each client, which weighs (i) the impact of the modality, gauged by Shapley value analysis, (ii) the modality model size as a gauge of communication overhead, against (iii) the frequency of modality model updates, denoted recency, to enhance generalizability.
(b) A client selection strategy for the server based on the local loss of modality model at each client.
Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of mmFedMC to achieve comparable accuracy to several baselines while reducing the communication overhead by over 20x. A demo video of our methodology is available at <span id="id6.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline"><a target="_blank" href="https://liangqiy.com/mmfedmc/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://liangqiy.com/mmfedmc/</a></span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) approach in which users collaboratively train ML models through sharing model parameters rather than raw measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The FL approach establishes a federation of learners, each updating their model based on local data. Subsequently, these locally learned parameters are uploaded to a central server or shared with other clients. The local model within each client is then updated by integrating an aggregation of these parameters, ensuring that each model benefits from the collective learning experience <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Since Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smartphones, robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), etc., are frequently equipped with multimodal sensors and rely on their performance and robustness, there has been increasing interest in multimodal federated learning (mmFL) frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For example, consider a set of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with various sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and Radar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. These multimodal sensors enable control decisions in various driving scenarios, including varying weather conditions and fields of view. CAVs could benefit greatly be leveraging methods such as mmFL to collaboratively learn ML models across vehicles, such as on-board prognostics and diagnostics to estimate the vehicle’s state of health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multimodal fusion is a process of combining information from two or more modalities to make predictions, effectively enhancing the performance and robustness of ML models by leveraging cross modality interactions that provide richer representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Fusion methods are generally categorized as early, late, and intermediate, depending on the network layer where the modalities are merged. As the names suggest, early fusion implies fusion at the data-level, late fusion or decision-level fusion occurs at the output, and intermediate fusion leverages intermediate layers for the fusion of feature representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Generally, data-level fusion relies on the alignment of dimensions across different data modalities to concatenate their channels; for example, an 3D RGB image can be combined with an 1D depth image to form an 4D RGB-D image for input into an ML model. Feature-level fusion combines features or outputs from intermediate layers of the various modalities. This allows for more nuanced interactions between modalities, but presents the challenge of a large search space within the network topologies. Decision-level fusion offers greater flexibility as it does not require concatenating feature vectors within the ML model. Instead, it aggregates decisions post-output from various models via some fusion decision logic to form a final prediction. However, more refined decision representations, such as those in decision-level fusion, may result in the loss of critical information during the fusion process, potentially limiting the model’s ability to make holistic inferences. This trade-off between information retention and fusion sophistication is a key consideration in the design of multimodal learning systems.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of the IoT, where devices measure a diverse set of modalities, most existing mmFL frameworks call for massive parallel processing of extensive sensor data streams <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. They utilize multimodal fusion to boost model performance, especially in scenarios where heterogeneous clients lack one or more modalities. However, IoT devices often possess communication constraints due to bandwidth limitations, location, and varying capabilities. This has also been a key bottleneck in conventional (single modality) FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Thus, there is still a need to devise strategies to reduce communication overhead and improve learning efficiency within the mmFL paradigm. We summarize the existing gaps and challenges in the current mmFL frameworks as follows.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client Heterogeneity</span> is commonly regarded as statistical heterogeneity, where each client’s data distribution is non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID), with some clients potentially lacking samples from certain categories and thereby having differing densities. However, in real-world applications, especially in mmFL settings, client heterogeneity is more diverse, manifesting in various forms such as individual, group, and system differences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Individual heterogeneity is seen in minor feature variations (e.g., walking frequencies), while group heterogeneity arises from physiological and background differences (e.g., left-hander vs. right-hander groups). System heterogeneity is influenced by external factors, such as the age of data collection devices. Moreover, in mmFL, some clients may lack certain modalities (e.g., some CAVs are equipped with LiDAR, while others rely solely on vision-based systems for autonomous driving). These heterogeneities are increasingly important considerations in mmFL scenarios.</p>

Furthermore, the complexity of information patterns inherent in different data modalities affects the ease of learning. For instance, compared to high-resolution image data, simpler data modalities like time-series radar data, despite potentially lower accuracy, may require only simple ML models for effective training and recognition due to their smaller data size and straightforward pattern recognition.</p>

It remains an open question as to which modality or combination of modalities should be prioritized in the predictions, considering their information richness. Moreover, the extent of client participation, influenced by factors such as data availability and quality, also plays a vital role in determining the effectiveness of different modalities within the mmFL framework.</p>

An overview of our proposed method and comparison with traditional mmFL are given in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality and Client Selection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We propose a decision-level fusion approach, where predictions from <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global modality models</span> are used as input to the individual <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local ensemble model</span> in each client. This allows for the independent deployment of the modality models in various application scenarios, accommodating situations where a client may possess a different set of modalities. Furthermore, we consider classical ML models, such as Random Forest, for our ensemble instead of the complex neural networks typically used in traditional mmFL, resulting in reduced computational overhead and easily interpretable modality impacts. While modality models are uploaded to the server for aggregation to enhance generalization, each client retains the ensemble model locally to improve personalization and confidence. Retaining the ensemble model local to the client minimizes the risk of leakage of client sensitive information to the server either directly or indirectly via server side inferencing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Building on this foundation, we introduce the concept of <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">joint modality and client selection</span>. First, <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">selective modality communication</span> acknowledges that clients may not always have the capacity or necessity to upload all modality models (e.g., resource-constrained IoT applications). This approach is based on factors such as modality performance or its impact on the final decision, communication overhead, and recency. To evaluate the impact of each modality, we propose employing Shapley values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, measured on the ensemble model, to quantify their respective performances. Communication overheads are determined by quantifying the size of modality models, while recency is gauged by tracking the upload history of modalities. Complementing this, <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">selective client uploading</span> is proposed to further reduce communication overheads and address the effects of client heterogeneity on the global model. This involves ranking each client based on the local loss of modality model, thereby optimizing both the efficiency and effectiveness of our FL framework.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The real-world nature of multimodal data and the complementary advantages of multimodality have gradually drawn attention to mmFL. Recently, a variety of algorithms have been proposed to improve the performance of mmFLs based on different fusion techniques. Qi <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposed a data-level fusion FL system tailored for the combination of wearable sensor signals and images for user fall detection. Xiong <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> implemented a feature-level fusion approach with attention modules. Feng <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> presented two decision-layer fusion strategies using concatenation and attention modules, respectively, to address three types of client heterogeneities: modality absence, label absence, and label errors. Outside of fusion strategies, Salehi <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> incorporated the mmFL framework into CAVs and conducted real-world experiments. In their FLASH framework, clients randomly select and upload one of the three modality models or an ensemble model for aggregation. Chen <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> integrated mmFL into decentralized FL, aiming to facilitate collaborative training within client networks without server support.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, most current mmFL implementations rely solely on end-to-end models for FL. For example, in data-level fusion, it is common to see input concatenation either merely expand channels in images or increase feature quantity through concatenation. These end-to-end models face limitations not only in scenarios where heterogeneous clients may miss certain modalities, but also inherit the drawbacks of multimodality, such as larger model sizes, increased computational costs, and reduced interpretability. The limitations of data-level fusion encompass challenges such as the high dimensionality of the input space, which hampers scalability to new modalities. In addition, the integration of modalities with varying granularities, such as audio and video, poses significant difficulties in forming a uniform input vector, further complicating the fusion process. Therefore, our paper considers a decision-level fusion algorithm, training each single-modality model separately to address the shortcomings of end-to-end models, especially in missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, by employing a traditional ML model as the ensemble model, we offer insightful demonstrations of modality impacts throughout the FL process, which further facilitates subsequent modality selection.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From feature selection and sample filtering to modality selection, such feature engineering techniques have been widely applied in the ML domain to improve accuracy, reduce computational overhead, and eliminate outliers. Recent studies employing Shapley values have shown that, in data fusion, different input features exert varying impacts on model output <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. For example, Yuan <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> used Shapley values to demonstrate that sensor placement significantly affects the fusion process. Yuan <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> reduced over 400 frequency-corresponding received signal strength indicators (RSSI) to just five using the Shapley value, thereby markedly improving the sampling rate of sensor configurations. Compared to well-established feature selection methods, modality selection remains a nascent field, despite numerous studies employing single-modality or various modality combinations as baselines to validate the effectiveness of multimodal approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. However, there is no universally accurate method to guide proper modality selection, especially in dynamic contexts like FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the extensive heterogeneity among clients, encompassing individual, group, and system heterogeneity, as well as varying richness of information, information asymmetry, and concerns of security and privacy, it becomes essential for FL frameworks to incorporate static or dynamic client selection for uploading and aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, to date, no work has addressed client selection in the context of mmFL, particularly in scenarios like the proposed mmFedMC, which involves separate global modality models. In such cases, varying biases in different global modality models can influence the selection outcome of various modalities within clients. Notably, our extensive empirical experiment demonstrates that, due to the profound heterogeneity among clients, those with lower local losses can achieve faster error convergence. A case in point is in FL frameworks involving left-hander and right-hander groups, where the global loss exhibits a bimodal loss function (i.e., two local minima). Client selection focusing on higher local losses would cause the global model to oscillate between the two groups. In contrast, selecting clients with lower local losses ensures that the current modality model at least tends towards one group.</p>

The purpose is to give the modality models a global perspective, ensuring a wider generalization. These modality models adhere to the classical FL iterative process and are deployed as global modality models. On the contrary, the personalized ensemble model undergoes a two-stage update. In Stage #1, the ensemble model serves as an intermediate state, primarily facilitating the calculation of the Shapley values. It is not deployed in any application (i.e., it is not tested in any test set). In Stage #2, after receiving the global modality models from the server, the clients subsequently update their ensemble model using global modality models in conjunction with local data to achieve the final state.</p>

It integrates data from six different types of wearable sensors, documenting human interactions with objects and the environment in a kitchen context. Activities include tasks such as peeling a cucumber, slicing a potato, cleaning a plate with a sponge, and so forth. Fig. 3 illustrates the six modality data from the ActionSense dataset for Subject 00 while peeling a potato. The eye tracking data show that the subject’s gaze is primarily focused on the potato within their field of vision for most of the time. The left hand is engaged in holding and controlling the rotation of the potato, while the right hand is occupied with gripping the peeler and moving it forward and back to peel the potato. The subject exhibits minimal movement in the torso, and most of the movement occurs in the arms. Consequently, the data reveal that the Tactile Right modality registers high pressure amplitudes due to the peeling action, and some of the Body Tracking signals exhibit regular variations, while other Body Tracking signals remain relatively unchanged. The proposed joint modality and client selection, along with demonstrations of modality impact and client upload frequency, can be found in a demo video available at <a target="_blank" href="https://liangqiy.com/mmfedmc/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://liangqiy.com/mmfedmc/</a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL frameworks, the average communication overhead of clients accumulates until it reaches our predefined threshold (5 MB or 25 MB). Taking the ActionSense dataset as an example, the six modalities – Eye Tracking, EMG Left, EMG Right, Tactile Left, Tactile Right, and Body Tracking – have sizes of 0.27 MB, 0.28 MB, 0.28 MB, 2.26 MB, 2.26 MB, and 0.39 MB, respectively. We simply use the size of the uploaded modality models to simulate communication overhead. However, in real-world scenarios, these overheads would be larger, including client information (e.g., local loss for client selection), metadata of modality models, error correction codes, protocol overheads, encryption, and more.</p>

At the system level, we use two types of baselines for comprehensive comparisons: the traditional multimodal fusion technique and the ablation study of our method. We consider four state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal FL frameworks, encompassing data-level (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>), feature-level (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>), decision-level (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>) fusion, as well as random submodel uploading (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> with uniform probabilities). Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mmFedMC, we also conduct experiments where the modality selection strategy, client selection strategy, or both strategies are substituted with random selections. To ensure a fair systematic comparison within the FL context, we do not incorporate various specialized techniques present in these baselines, such as co-attention mechanisms. All these baselines employ a uniform network architecture, specifically, an LSTM/convolution layer followed by a fully connected layer, utilizing a concatenate strategy for fusion.</p>

The experiment results show that even random selection strategies, despite leading to more aggregation iterations due to reduced communication overhead, contribute to substantial performance gains. Moreover, this improvement in accuracy is strongly attributed to the proposed decision-level fusion approach, where a client receives the global modality models from the server and undergoes a local ensemble model update. The modality models, through aggregation, not only become more generalized by acquiring information from other clients, but also allow the ensemble model to further fine-tune and personalize based on the new global modality models. The proposed mmFedMC not only exceeds in terms of accuracy but also manages to reduce communication overhead by nearly an order of magnitude, thanks to its selective communication strategy. Insights obtained from mmFedMC’s selection approach are:</p>

This is attributed to the selective modality and client communication strategy, where not only does the lower communication cost promote more frequent aggregation, but also the Shapley value and client selection based on local loss can identify the clients with a greater impact in each modality. Due to the inherent randomness, random modality and client selections in some scenarios might marginally outperform mmFedMC. This is because randomness, to some extent, ensures that all modalities for all clients have the same probability of being selected. However, this is not the optimal solution as excessive randomness and instability are not preferable.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison between IID and Natural Distribution.</span> From the results, it is not always the case that the IID setting provides a clear advantage in model generalization during training. In fact, both IID and natural distribution settings present unique challenges due to client heterogeneity. Under the natural distribution scenario, we typically presume that each client’s training and testing data distributions are similar yet biased. For example, a hospital in Asia is unlikely to receive a large influx of patients from North America when deploying a model. In such scenarios, the ensemble model adapts to Asian patient data by fine-tuning and personalizing based on the global modality models. Therefore, in the IID setting, the ensemble model may not effectively leverage its potential. Moreover, in the natural distribution scenario, the number of samples per client might more likely follow a normal distribution, whereas in the IID setting, it would exhibit a uniform distribution. Take the PTB-XL dataset as an example, where three hospital sites hold 93.54% of the data in the FL framework, with 34 out of 39 hospital sites having fewer than 100 samples each. Similarly, in the MELD dataset, six speakers possess 92.68% of the data in the FL framework, and 36 out of 42 speakers have fewer than 100 samples each. Consequently, many clients with few samples could lead to overfitting, resulting in small local losses and impacting our client selection strategy. We will further discuss the implications of client sample size in the natural distribution scenario in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Influence of Overfitting on Client Selection ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality and Client Selection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>.</p>

As the sizes of the modality models are constant, if a modality with a smaller feature dimension contains comparable information, the FL framework might initially choose it due to its larger Shapley value. However, due to server aggregation, this modality model will have an even greater Shapley value in the next communication round, leading the FL framework to continuously focus only on this modality, a situation we refer to as the single modality optimization trap. In such cases, a modality might be sufficiently trained within just 10 communication rounds, but the FL framework should shift its focus to other modalities to fully leverage the advantages of multimodality. Thus, the introduction of the recency term is essentially a means of injecting uncertainty, allowing FL to focus on other modalities. It is important to note that our goal is not to train all modality models perfectly, especially in edge clients with limited resources. Instead, we aim for FL to focus on certain modalities that not only possess rich information but also have a sufficiently small feature dimension.</p>

For example, in the UCI-HAR dataset, the two modalities have identical data dimensions (i.e., 128<math id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1b"><times id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p4.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>3), leading to the same modality model size (i.e., 0.26 MB). Consequently, using communication overhead for modality selection is ineffective in this context. Moreover, although we intend to use recency to encourage the FL framework to focus on different modalities, in cases with only two data modalities, recency can cause the framework to cyclically select these two modalities. This significantly diminishes the effectiveness of the Shapley value. Therefore, our proposed mmFedMC is expected to perform better in datasets like ActionSense, which feature multimodal data with varying feature dimensions. In such settings, the diverse dimensions enable more nuanced and effective modality selection, leveraging the strengths of Shapley value, communication overhead, and recency in a more balanced and impactful manner.</p>

In the initial stages of FL, data with simpler features exhibit higher impact because the modality model will more easily capture its information. As communication rounds progress, modalities with larger feature sets and complex models, due to their higher communication overhead, take on a subordinate role in their selection within mmFedMC. As FL advances, more straightforward modalities that still convey ample information, such as Body Tracking, emerge as primary contributors.</p>

In the early stages of FL, the Eye Tracking modality, due to its simple structure, facilitated easy extraction of information from features and had a smaller data size, leading to a lower communication overhead. This resulted in a higher upload frequency, placing it advantageously in the balance between information gain and communication cost. However, as communication rounds progressed, the selection frequency of the Eye Tracking modality tended to decrease, while that of the Body Tracking modality increased. This shift in modality preference is driven by the trade-off between information value and communication cost. Furthermore, as the FL process progresses and modality models become more well trained, the impact of simpler but less information-rich modalities like Eye Tracking gradually diminishes. Conversely, the Tactile Right modality, despite being the most complex and having the highest communication cost, maintained a preferential secondary position due to its rich information content. On the other hand, the Tactile Left modality, while having a broader feature dimension, remained at a disadvantage possibly due to less diverse actions from the subject’s left hand. Over time, this increased communication cost impacts the overall efficiency of the FL process, leading to a preference for modalities like Body Tracking, which offer valuable information with less data transmission and hence are more cost-effective.</p>

Given that this dataset comprises only two modalities with identical feature dimensions, the competition between them hinges solely on the Shapley value and recency. As discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS4.SSS1" title="4.4.1 Trade-Off Analysis ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study for Modality Selection ‣ 4 Experiment and Results ‣ Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality and Client Selection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4.1</span></a>, recency tends to diminish the effectiveness of Shapley values. Thus, in situations where feature dimensions, modality model sizes, and information richness are similar, the Accelerometer and Gyroscope display comparable the Shapley value. The slightly higher Shapley value of the Gyroscope compared to the Accelerometer can be attributed as Gyroscopes are particularly adept at capturing rotational movements and angular velocities, which are crucial in differentiating these activities. For example, the distinct patterns of rotation and angular momentum while running or climbing stairs are more pronounced and detectable by a gyroscope than by an accelerometer.</p>

In our proposed multimodal decision-level fusion FL framework, where each modality has a global modality model, our preference leans towards quickly converging these global modality models to a local minima before proceeding to fusion. It is evident that in most configurations, the strategy of selecting clients with lower local losses outperforms the random client selection approach, which in turn is superior to the strategy of selecting clients with higher local losses.

It is observable that the strategy that favors higher local loss results in a more uniform distribution of client selection (i.e., each client is chosen with a more frequency). In contrast, the strategy that prioritizes lower local loss demonstrates a preference for a subset of clients. The rationale behind these distinct distributions of client selection frequency lies in the fact that local loss depends not only on the richness of information in client data, but also heavily on client heterogeneity and model optimization, among other factors. A client significantly deviating from most others due to heterogeneity and also high data noise, erroneous data, or even malicious attacks like data poisoning, would exhibit higher local loss. Therefore, while the strategy based on lower local loss may risk overfitting due to data homogeneity, the higher local loss strategy could be greatly perturbed by client heterogeneity. Furthermore, thanks to multimodality and decision-level fusion, the risk of overfitting can be further mitigated.</p>

On the one hand, changing the needs of applications can lead to adjustments in parameter weights; for example, communication resources may be more abundant at night, allowing for a lower setting of the weight of communication overhead <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha_{c}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">c</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑐</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha_{c}</annotation></semantics></math>. On the other hand, in certain contexts, these parameters may not be effective; for example, if two modalities have identical data dimensions, as is the case with the UCI-HAR dataset, the trade-off related to communication overhead becomes irrelevant. Therefore, in such situations, we might consider alternative parameters to optimize modality selection, such as sensor sampling rates, energy consumption, sensor cost, and so on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. These considerations could provide additional dimensions to the selection strategy, enabling a more comprehensive approach tailored to the specific constraints and objectives of the FL system in question.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed client selection strategy is predicated on local loss; however, in instances of extremely unbalanced data distribution, the ostensibly low local losses, which may arise from overfitting, could potentially compromise the efficacy of client selection. This susceptibility to overfitting arises for three factors: low statistical class divergence (e.g., clients possessing only one or two classes), a small number of client samples (e.g., clients with only tens of samples), and varied modality properties (e.g., different sensors have different sampling rates). Such scenarios are prevalent, particularly in healthcare, where many hospitals may have a small patient population, and the majority of these patients may present as normal. In the datasets experimented in this paper, for example, in the PTB-XL dataset, 34 out of 39 clients have fewer than 100 samples; in the MELD dataset, 36 out of 42 clients have fewer than 100 samples; and in the DFC23 dataset, 6 out of 27 clients exhibit significant class imbalance (i.e., one class represents more than 80% of the total sample size). In the ActionSense dataset, the six different sensors have varying sampling rates, with Tactile sensors at 15 Hz and Body Tracking sensors at 60 Hz, leading to fewer samples for Tactile modalities, and thus a heightened risk of overfitting. Additionally, certain sensors may not be well-suited for some applications, which can lead to the model learning from noise and overfitting, such as the Tactile Left sensor displaying minimal signal variation across different activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Disparities in data distribution can amplify overfitting risks, affecting the local loss metric, and potentially resulting in biased client selection. Clients with such extreme imbalances might be considered outliers and could be preemptively excluded from the FL process, akin to a static client pre-selection strategy. Post-FL, these outlier clients could benefit from using the trained global models as a starting point for further fine-tuning, thus addressing the challenges posed by their unique data characteristics.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce the mmFedMC framework that minimizes communication overhead and enhances learning efficiency through joint modality and client selection strategies. By optimizing modality selection with Shapley values, modality model sizes, and recency, as well as favoring clients with lower local loss for client selection, we achieve considerable recognition accuracy and up to 20x increase in communication efficiency. The proposed mmFedMC is highly flexible, suitable for heterogeneous clients, offers modular modality models that can be detached, and provides impact for data modalities. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of real-world datasets, including wearable sensors, healthcare, NLP, and remote sensing satellite datasets, demonstrate the outstanding performance of the mmFedMC framework across various data modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our future work will focus on enhancing the adaptability of mmFedMC through dynamic configuration. For modality selection, we could adjust the weight of communication overhead based on the dynamically available communication resources in the real world (such as higher bandwidth at night), allowing for the uploading of more modality models. For client selection, we may consider a dynamic strategy based on local loss, employing selection of higher local losses at the initial stages of FL to speed up convergence, and transitioning to the proposed lower local loss selection towards the end to optimize local minima. Additionally, we contemplate that Shapley values could further refine sensor deployment, potentially halting the training of underperforming modalities to reduce computational overhead, energy consumption, and sensor costs.</p>
