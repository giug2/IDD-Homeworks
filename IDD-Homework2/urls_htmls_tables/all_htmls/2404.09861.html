<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a popular solution for distributed machine learning (ML). While FL has traditionally been studied for supervised ML tasks, in many applications, it is impractical to assume availability of labeled data across devices. To this end, we develop Cooperative Federated unsupervised Contrastive Learning (<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL)</span> to facilitate FL across edge devices with unlabeled datasets. <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> employs local device cooperation where either explicit (i.e., raw data) or implicit (i.e., embeddings) information is exchanged through device-to-device (D2D) communications to improve local diversity.
Specifically, we introduce a <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">smart information push-pull</span> methodology for data/embedding exchange tailored to FL settings with either soft or strict data privacy restrictions. Information sharing is conducted through a probabilistic importance sampling technique at receivers leveraging a carefully crafted reserve dataset provided by transmitters. In the implicit case, embedding exchange is further integrated into the local ML training at the devices via a regularization term incorporated into the contrastive loss, augmented with a dynamic contrastive margin to adjust the volume of latent space explored. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> leads to alignment of latent spaces learned across devices, results in faster and more efficient global model training, and is effective in extreme non-i.i.d. data distribution settings across devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many emerging intelligence tasks require training machine learning (ML) models on a distributed dataset across a collection of wireless edge devices (e.g., smartphones, smart cars) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
utilizes the computational resources available at edge devices for data processing. Under conventional FL, model training consists of (i) a sequence of local iterations by devices on their individual datasets, and (ii) periodic global aggregations by a main server to generate a global model that is synchronized across devices to begin the next training round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we are motivated by two fundamental challenges related to implementation of FL over real-world edge networks. First, device datasets are often non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), causing local models to be biased and a significant degradation in global model performance. Second, data samples collected by each device (e.g., images, sensor measurements) are often unlabeled, which makes supervised ML model training impossible. We aim to jointly address these challenges with a novel methodology for information sampling and exchange across devices while remaining sensitive to any data privacy restrictions.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most works in FL assume labeled data across the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Large amounts of unlabeled data can be useful to learn representations of a large scale distributed dataset with the objective of adapting to many downstream tasks, such as classification, segmentation, etc., through zero or few shot learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

we provide a brief literature review to summarize the extensive line of work in supervised FL, and then detail the current state of the art in unsupervised FL.

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have aimed to address the impact of non-i.i.d. device data distributions on FL performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,
convergence analysis of FL via device gradient diversity-based metrics is conducted, and control algorithms for adapting system parameters (e.g., aggregation frequencies) to optimize convergence speeds are proposed.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, a reinforcement learning-based method for device selection is introduced, aiming to counteract local model biases caused by non-i.i.d. data.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A few works have recently considered unsupervised FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a local pretraining methodology was introduced to generate unsupervised device model representations for downstream machine learning tasks. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed addressing the inconsistency of local representations arising from non-i.i.d unlabelled datasets through a dictionary-based method implemented at the server. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the dataset imbalance problem is addressed with weight aggregation at the server being defined according to inferred sample densities. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, unsupervised FL is considered for the case where unlabeled device data has been subdivided into sets that can be treated as surrogate labels for training. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> exploit similarities across locally trained unsupervised model representations to correct against biases by maximizing local agreement with the global models.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contrastive learning</span> (CL) as our framework for unsupervised ML, and extend it to the federated setting.
CL is an ML technique which aims to learn embeddings of unlabeled datapoints that maximize the distance between different data points and minimizes it for similar points in the latent space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Our work adapts contrastive learning to a federated setting, while avoiding the additional work of assigning surrogate labels to datapoints such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Our work enables contrastive learning to be performed on exclusively unlabelled data, as opposed to a combination of supervised and contrastive learning, such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Along these lines, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a self-supervised learning framework for federated systems using contrastive loss, and propose a divergence-aware method for local model updates which adjusts local models towards global knowledge. In contrast, our work employs the contrastive learning framework to identify and share crucial information between devices, to promotes alignment between local models during federated training.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the major challenges faced in the implementation of FL over real-world networks is data heterogeneity across devices, which as discussed in Sec. I-A, leads to local model bias.

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When information sharing is permitted in FL, there are many scenarios in which inter-device information exchange may be preferred to sharing the information with a server and training the model in a centralized manner. This includes settings where the server is far away from the devices (e.g., in large wireless cells) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, where there is a large hierarchy of nodes separating device and server (e.g., in hierarchical fog networks) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and/or where the server’s computational capabilities beyond facilitating model aggregations are limited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In a networked system, explicit information exchange exposes raw user information, which makes it suitable only for applications that are not subject to stringent restrictions of data privacy, such as computation offloading in (i) wireless sensor networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>
(ii) self driving vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>,
and (iii) resource constrained IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>
. One of the main advantages of explicit information exchange in a FL setting is that is does not require any pre-processing of features of data, and thus makes it suitable for resource constrained edge devices to incorporate into training (e.g., sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles). On the other hand, in applications with strict data privacy concerns (e.g. facial recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>,
user activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and some text mining applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>), exchange of only implicit information is permitted, since it is retrieving raw data features from the encoded information is extremely difficult  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. That being said, obtaining implicit/encoded information requires pre-processing of data at the end users, which in turn can impose high latency and computation burden.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Information exchange among FL devices has been studied by a few recent works, most of which are concerned with supervised FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In this work, we aim to design smart data (i.e., explicit information) and embedding (i.e., implicit information) exchange for cooperative FL systems via exploiting device-to-device (D2D) communications. Our method can be applied for scenarios which allow for inter-device communication, and is compatible with different levels of privacy restrictions. We employ explicit information exchange for scenarios which are not subject to stringent privacy restrictions, such as wireless sensor networks aiming to learn about an environment across different modalities of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) networks which benefit from exchanging traffic information among vehicles to optimally plan routes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and swarm robotics where agents aim to cooperate to achieve a common goal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, for scenarios where data privacy is a primary concern, such as distributed healthcare systems
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>,
we employ implicit information exchange, with embeddings that cannot be used to reconstruct source datapoints. We also aim for our method to facilitate information exchange in a fully distributed manner, i.e., without any added control overhead at the FL server.</p>

However, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of raw data sharing in unsupervised FL has not been studied. In contrastive learning, the model at each device can use exchanged information as negatives for anchors selected from local data, and as anchors where negatives are selected from local data to improve the overall training performance (see Sec. <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Unsupervised FL Formulation ‣ II System Model and Machine Learning Task ‣ Unsupervised Federated Optimization at the Edge: D2D-Enabled Learning without Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a> for the definition of negative and anchor datapoints). To exploit D2D communications as a substrate for improving local model alignment, we design a probabilistic smart data push-pull strategy for unsupervised FL that enables devices to exchange raw datapoints that have the highest expected impact on the performance of the global model.</p>

Implicit information exchange also provides users with flexibility in choosing their communication payload, as the dimensionality of the representation is a user defined parameter. The size of explicit information, on the other hand, is predetermined. In case of implicit information exchange, adjusting this dimension allows us to improve communication and computation requirements for resource-limited devices.</p>

We propose to accelerate this alignment across devices by smart data (i.e., explicit information) or embedding (i.e., implicit information) transfers. Intuitively, when the data across the devices is homogeneous (i.e., i.i.d.), the latent spaces learned locally will be aligned, under which the global model training will exhibit a fast convergence. Thus, given non-i.i.d. data distributions, we aim to select and share a set of <span id="S2.SS2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">important</span> datapoints or embeddings across the devices, that result in the closest alignment of their local models.</p>

The benefit of local dataset diversification has been established analytically in existing works for supervised FL, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.
CF-CL builds upon this theoretical foundation, as the push-pull mechanism employed by each device assigns importance to datapoints/embeddings at their neighbors according to the dissimilarity from their local distribution.</p>

This term naturally puts a higher weight on the regularization when the received embeddings are fresh.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth mentioning that regularization terms have been previously explored in FL research via the well known work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> and its subsequent literature in a different context.
Implementations such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> consider proximal regularization terms imposed on the model parameters (i.e., neural network parameters) to enhance the convergence of FL over non-i.i.d data.
The focus of our work and in turn our regularization term exploits the information exchange in unsupervised FL, which is fundamentally different from previous literature focusing on model parameter weights. Hence, the regularization term in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> can be further mounted on top of our technique.</p>

Both explicit and implicit <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> outperform respective baselines in terms of achieved model accuracy over training iterations, due to their ability to select information crucial to the alignment of local models. More specifically, the improvement over baselines validates a few aspects of <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span>’s design:
(a) exchanging information that is both representative of the transmitter’s local dataset and important to the receiver (i.e., compared with K-means and Uniform),
(b) selecting reserve information which accurately represents the local data/embedding distributions, and
(c) adapting to the changes in local embedding distributions over the training duration.(i.e., compared to Bulk). We observe that in all cases, explicit <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> converges faster than implicit <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span>.

We also observe that the explicit version of <span id="S4.SS3.p2.5.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> is more resilient to local model differences, this is consistent with the fact that the information exchanged is not a function of the model at the transmitter.</p>

We vary the number of labels in each device’s local dataset and show that as the local data distributions become more non-i.i.d. (i.e., fewer labels per device), the speed of convergence of the methods drop due to more biased local models. In such cases, higher connectivity significantly improves the performance, as a higher connectivity allows for the exposure of local datasets to a more diverse set of information resulting in less biased local models. We also find that in Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf1" title="Figure 11(a) ‣ Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Impact of Variation in System Parameters ‣ IV Numerical Experiments ‣ Unsupervised Federated Optimization at the Edge: D2D-Enabled Learning without Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf3" title="Figure 11(c) ‣ Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Impact of Variation in System Parameters ‣ IV Numerical Experiments ‣ Unsupervised Federated Optimization at the Edge: D2D-Enabled Learning without Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(c)</span></a>, the performance on the FMNIST dataset improves significantly more than on the USPS dataset, as classification using FMNIST is a more complex learning task, and thus affected by non-i.i.d to a larger extent. We also observe that in the case of implicit information exchange, once the number of labels per device become large enough, the performance of our method for sparse and densely connected graphs is either equivalent as in Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf2" title="Figure 11(b) ‣ Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Impact of Variation in System Parameters ‣ IV Numerical Experiments ‣ Unsupervised Federated Optimization at the Edge: D2D-Enabled Learning without Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(b)</span></a> or our method performs better in a sparsely connected graph as in Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf4" title="Figure 11(d) ‣ Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Impact of Variation in System Parameters ‣ IV Numerical Experiments ‣ Unsupervised Federated Optimization at the Edge: D2D-Enabled Learning without Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(d)</span></a>.

A densely connected graph of devices, where each device has local access to a large number of labels may result in the exchange of redundant information, resulting in a slower convergence rate, especially in the earlier stages of training.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed Cooperative Federated unsupervised Contrastive Learning (<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span>). In <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span>, devices learn local representations of unlabeled data and engage in cooperative smart explicit or implicit information push-pull to eliminate the local model bias. In case of explicit information exchange, we proposed an efficient randomized data importance estimation and subsequently developed a two-staged probabilistic data sampling scheme across the devices. In case of implicit information exchange, we designed a probabilistic embedding exchange scheme and modified the definition of triplet loss function to use the exchanged embeddings while taking into account for their freshness.
Through numerical simulations, we studied the model training behavior of <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> and showed that it outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
Future work can extend <span id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CF-CL</span> from single-hop information sharing to multi-hop information sharing and D2D link formation under network constraints. Such a system will require a more nuanced method of information importance estimation to take into account first hop neighbors, as well as higher order neighbours in the D2D graph.</p>
