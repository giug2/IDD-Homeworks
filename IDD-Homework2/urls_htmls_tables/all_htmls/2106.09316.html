<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p"><em id="id5.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Over-the-air federated edge learning</em><span id="id5.id1.2" class="ltx_text"> (Air-FEEL) has emerged as a communication-efficient solution to enable distributed machine learning over edge devices by using their data locally to preserve the privacy.
By exploiting the waveform superposition property of wireless channels, Air-FEEL allows the “one-shot” over-the-air aggregation of gradient-updates to enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of a compromised learning performance due to the aggregation errors caused by channel fading and noise. This paper investigates the transmission power control to combat against such aggregation errors in Air-FEEL. Different from conventional power control designs (e.g., to minimize the individual <em id="id5.id1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mean squared error</em> (MSE) of the over-the-air aggregation at each round), we consider a new power control design aiming at directly maximizing the convergence speed. Towards this end, we first analyze the convergence behavior of Air-FEEL (in terms of the optimality gap) subject to aggregation errors at different communication rounds. It is revealed that if the aggregation estimates are unbiased, then the training algorithm would converge exactly to the optimal point with mild conditions; while if they are biased, then the algorithm would converge with an error floor determined by the accumulated estimate bias over communication rounds. Next, building upon the convergence results, we optimize the power control to directly minimize the derived optimality gaps under the cases without and with unbiased aggregation constraints, subject to a set of average and maximum power constraints at individual edge devices.
We transform both problems into convex forms, and obtain their structured optimal solutions, both appearing in a form of regularized channel inversion, by using the Lagrangian duality method. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed power control policies achieve significantly faster convergence for Air-FEEL, as compared with benchmark policies with fixed power transmission or conventional MSE minimization.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the pursuit of ubiquitous brain-inspired intelligence envisioned in the future 6G networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, recent years have witnessed the spreading of <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">artificial intelligence</span> (AI) algorithms from the cloud to the network edge, resulting in an active area called edge intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
The core research issue therein is to allow low-latency and privacy-aware access to rich mobile data for intelligence distillation.
To this end, the <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</span> (FEEL) framework has been proposed recently, which distributes the AI-model training task over edge devices by using their data locally to preserve the privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Essentially, the FEEL framework corresponds to the implementation of <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed gradient descent</span> over wireless networks.
Such a training process is to find optimized AI-model parameters by minimizing a properly designed loss function in an iterative manner.
Specifically, at each iteration or communication round, the edge server first broadcasts the global AI-model parameters to edge devices, such that all edge devices can synchronize their local models;
next, the edge devices compute their respective local gradient updates using the local data and then upload them to the edge server for further aggregation to update the global model.
Although the uploading of high-volume raw data is avoided, the gradient aggregation process in FEEL may still suffer from a communication bottleneck due to the high dimensionality of each gradient update, especially when the number of edge devices sharing the same wireless medium becomes large.
To tackle this issue, one promising solution called <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">over-the-air</span> FEEL (Air-FEEL) has been proposed (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), which exploits the <span id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</span> (AirComp) technique for “one-shot” aggregation by allowing multiple devices’ concurrent update transmission. In such a way, the communication and computation are integrated in a joint design by exploiting the superposition property of a <span id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple access channel</span> (MAC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of AirComp was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> for data aggregation in sensor networks, which harnessed the “interference” via structured codes to help functional computation over a MAC. The subsequent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> showed that for Gaussian <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">independent and identically distributed</span> (i.i.d.) data sources, the uncoded (analog) transmission is optimal to minimize the distortion in AirComp.
Building on the information-theoretic studies, the analog AirComp implementation has attracted growing research interests (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>). For instance, the synchronization issue in AirComp was addressed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> via a shared clock broadcasting from edge server to devices; the optimal power control policies for AirComp over fading channels were derived in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to minimize the average computation distortion; and the cooperative interference management for multi-cell AirComp networks was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple-input-multiple-output</span> (MIMO) spatial multiplexing was exploited in AirComp to enable vector-valued functional computation targeting multi-modal sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and to enhance the computational accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, AirComp found its merits in the new context of FEEL, namely the Air-FEEL, to enable the communication-efficient gradient aggregation at each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Prior works studied the Air-FEEL system from different perspectives such as devices scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, beamforming design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, update compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and hyper-parameters (such as learning rates) optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
For instance, a broadband Air-FEEL solution was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, where a set of communication-learning tradeoffs were derived to guide the device scheduling.
Along this vein, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed an energy-aware device scheduling strategy to minimize the expected improvement of loss function value at each communication round, while the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a threshold-based device selection scheme to achieve reliable model aggregation.
Then, for multi-antenna Air-FEEL systems, a joint design of device scheduling and receive beamforming was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and a unit-modulus analog receive beamforming design was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
As for update compression, a source-coding algorithm exploiting gradient sparsification was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and a compressive-sensing based gradient aggregation approach was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to further improve the communication efficiency.
Lately, Air-FEEL based on digital modulation was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and further extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, which features one-bit quantization and modulation at the edge devices and majority-vote based decoding at the edge server.
Besides improving the communication efficiency, the Air-FEEL has also been exploited for enhancing the data privacy, in which individual updates are not accessible by the centralized edge server, thus eliminating the risk of potential model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Generally speaking, the employment of AirComp introduces an essential design tradeoff in Air-FEEL between the the enhanced communication efficiency (via the over-the-air aggregation) and the degraded learning performance (due to the aggregation error caused by the channel fading and noise perturbation).
Due to such a tradeoff, how to analytically characterize the training performance (e.g., in terms of accuracy and latency) is a challenging task has not been investigated in the literature yet.
Also notice that the aggregation distortion in different communication rounds may have distinct impacts on the learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, thus making the above tradeoff even more complicated.
To deal with these issues, it is crucial to properly control the transmission power at different edge devices over different communication rounds.
In the literature, there have been prior works on Air-FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> that considered simplified channel inversion (or its variants) to align the channel gains among different devices, which, however, may lead to amplified noise at receiver and thus is highly suboptimal especially in deep fading scenarios.
Some other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> designed the power control with the objective of minimizing the individual aggregation distortion (e.g., <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mean squared error</span> (MSE)) at each communication round, which, however, may not perform well as the aggregation distortion in different communication rounds may have distinct impact on the learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, how to obtain the
analytic learning performance of Air-FEEL in terms of the power control variables, and accordingly optimize the power control decisions for optimizing the learning performance still remains unknown.
This thus motivates the current work.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies an Air-FEEL system consisting of multiple edge devices and one edge server. By considering smooth learning models satisfying the Polyak-Łojasiewicz inequality, we establish an elegant learning performance metric, namely the optimality gap, linking with the aggregation errors over communication rounds.
Accordingly, we propose optimized power control policies for directly minimizing the optimality gap.
The main contributions are summarized as follows.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Convergence analysis:</span>
First, we analyze the optimality gap of the loss function over different communication rounds, which characterizes the impact of gradient aggregation errors (i.e., the bias and MSE of the gradient aggregation estimates) on the convergence performance of the Air-FEEL algorithm. It is revealed that if the aggregation errors are unbiased, the optimality gap will diminish to zero with sufficiently many communication rounds and properly chosen step sizes; while if the aggregation errors are biased, the optimality gap would reach to an error floor whose height is equal to the accumulated estimate bias over communication rounds.
It is also shown that within a finite number of communication rounds, the aggregation errors at later rounds (with higher weights) contribute more to the optimality gap than those at earlier rounds.</p>

Next, building on the convergence results, we formulate new power control optimization problems for Air-FEEL under the cases without and with unbiased aggregation constraints, respectively, with the objective of minimizing the optimality gap, subject to a set of average and maximum power constraints at individual edge devices.
Fortunately, both power control problems can be transformed into convex forms, which can thus be optimally solved by the Lagrangian duality method. The optimized power control solutions establish a regularized channel inversion structure, where the regularization term at each edge device is related to all other devices’ average power budgets for the case without unbiased aggregation constraints, and is only related to the own device’s individual average power budget for the case with unbiased aggregation constraints.</p>

It is shown that the proposed power control policies in the cases without and with unbiased aggregation constraints achieve significantly faster convergence rate (or lower optimality gap), than the benchmarking fixed power transmission and conventional MSE minimization schemes, as the proposed policies can better handle the aggregation errors over rounds based on their contributions to the optimality gap. It is also shown that the the case without unbiased aggregation constraints can achieve lower optimality gap than that with biased aggregation constaints when some mild conditions are met. This validates our analysis that the Air-FEEL can always converge to the optimal point with unbiased gradient aggregation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The distributed training latency for FEEL is dominated by the update aggregation process, especially when the number of devices becomes large. Therefore, we focus on the aggregation process over a MAC.
To accelerate the learning, we employ the AirComp technique for fast gradient aggregation by exploiting the superposition property of the MAC. To implement AirComp, during the gradient-uploading phase, all devices transmit simultaneously over the same time-frequency block with proper phase compensation. For ease of exposition, it is assumed that the channel coefficients remain unchanged within each communication round, but may change over different rounds. It is also assumed that the edge devices can perfectly know their own <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">channel state information</span> (CSI), so they can compensate for the channel phase differences.</p>

floor in the training process. By contrast, for the case without unbiased aggregation constraints, the model under training may only converge to a neighborhood of the optimal point (if the aggregation is biased). However, the case with unbiased aggregation constraints may converge slower compared with its counterpart without unbiased aggregation constraints, as the enforcement of the unbiasness generally comes at a cost of elevated MSE that translates to a larger gap to the error floor <math id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Delta(N)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2.cmml">Δ</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.1" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">N</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2"><times id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2">Δ</ci><ci id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.I2.i2.p1.3.m3.1c">\Delta(N)</annotation></semantics></math>.

First, it is observed that the proposed power control policies (with both biased and unbiased aggregation constraints) and the conventional MSE minimization design achieve faster convergence and lower optimality gap than the fixed power transmission. This shows the benefit of power control optimization in accelerating the learning convergence rate, via either directly minimizing the optimality gap or indirectly minimizing the MSE.
Secondly, the proposed power control policies are observed to significantly outperform the conventional MSE minimization design in reducing the optimality gap. This is due to the fact that the contributions of aggregation errors to the optimality gap are distinct at different communication rounds (see Remark <a href="#Thmremark1" title="Remark 1. ‣ III-A Optimality Gap versus Aggregation Errors ‣ III Convergence Analysis ‣ Optimized Power Control Design for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), which cannot be captured by the conventional MSE minimization design.
Furthermore, the proposed power control policy under Case II (with unbiased aggregation constraints) is observed to achieve a lower optimality gap than the proposed power control policy under Case I (without unbiased aggregation constraints) when <math id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N&gt;150" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">150</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1"><gt id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.1"></gt><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.3">150</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p3.2.m2.1c">N&gt;150</annotation></semantics></math> under the fixed learning rate and <math id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N&gt;80" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">80</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1"><gt id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1"></gt><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3">80</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p3.3.m3.1c">N&gt;80</annotation></semantics></math> under the diminishing learning rates.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we exploited the transmission power control as a new design degree of freedom to optimize the learning performance of Air-FEEL. To this end, we first analyzed the convergence behavior of the FEEL algorithm (in terms of the optimality gap) and characterized the impact of aggregation errors, w.r.t. its bias and MSE, at different communication rounds.
It was observed that in the case with unbiased aggregation estimates, the FEEL algorithm would converge exactly to the optimal point with mild conditions; and otherwise, it would converge with an error floor.
Next, we proposed to directly minimize the derived optimality gaps by optimizing the power control, for which the optimal solutions are obtained to follow regularized channel inversion structures.
Finally, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed power control policies achieve significantly lower optimality gap in Air-FEEL, as compared with benchmark schemes with fixed power transmission and conventional MSE minimization.
We expect that this initial work can provide useful insights on exploiting the power control for enhancing the Air-FEEL performance.</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One interesting direction is to explore the large-scale Air-FEEL over multi-cell networks to accommodate massive edge devices with more data.

<p id="S6.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another interesting direction is to consider the FedAvg scenario, where the local updates at each edge devices are implemented multiple times, and the local models are aggregated over the air instead of gradients. The analysis and design principles in this paper are generally extendable to this scenario by taking into account the following two new technical challenges. First, as multiple local updates are implemented at edge devices, the introduced gradient/model errors due to aggregation in this paper are not applicable for FedAvg. Therefore, new approaches for analyzing the gradient/model errors in FedAvg should be considered for its convergence analysis. Next, while the learning rate plays a dual role of denoising factor for over-the-air gradient aggregation in FedSGD, in FedAvg we need a dedicated denoising factor to suppress the AirComp signal misalignment error for model aggregation. As a result, the denoising factors would become new design variables for joint optimization, thus making the problem more complicated.</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, it is also an interesting problem to fairly and quantitatively compare the performance of Air-FEEL versus the traditional digital FEEL (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>), in terms of the training latency and training accuracy.
General speaking, the proposed Air-FEEL can achieve significant per-round communication latency reduction over the digital FEEL, but at a cost of the newly introduced aggregation errors and the increased number of communication rounds needed for convergence. To deal with such a tradeoff, we need to explore the power control policy for training latency minimization while ensuring a given maximum optimality gap requirement for both Air-FEEL and digital FEEL. How to determine proper approximate optimality gaps for both Air-FEEL and digital FEEL to enable their fair training performance comparison is challenging in practice.</p>

<p id="A0.SS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Notice that problem (P2.1) is convex and satisfies the Slater’s condition, and thus strong duality holds between problem (P2.1) and its Lagrange dual problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we apply the Lagrange duality method to optimally solve problem (P2.1).
