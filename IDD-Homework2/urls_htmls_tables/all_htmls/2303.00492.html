<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Graph neural networks (GNN) have been widely deployed in real-world networked applications and systems due to their capability to handle graph-structured data. However, the growing awareness of data privacy severely challenges the traditional centralized model training paradigm, where a server holds all the graph information. Federated learning is an emerging collaborative computing paradigm that allows model training without data centralization. Existing federated GNN studies mainly focus on systems where clients hold distinctive graphs or sub-graphs. The practical node-level federated situation, where each client is only aware of its direct neighbors, has yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose the first federated GNN framework called <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Lumos</span> that supports supervised and unsupervised learning with feature and degree protection on node-level federated graphs. We first design a tree constructor to improve the representation capability given the limited structural information. We further present a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based algorithm to mitigate the workload imbalance caused by degree heterogeneity with theoretically-guaranteed performance. Based on the constructed tree for each client, a decentralized tree-based GNN trainer is proposed to support versatile training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Lumos</span> outperforms the baseline with significantly higher accuracy and greatly reduced communication cost and training time.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph-structured data are common in the real world. They can effectively represent complex relations in social networks, communication networks, and transportation networks.
Unlike typical data with simple structures, the complex graph topology underlying the graph data sophisticates the corresponding prediction tasks. Graph representation learning addresses the problem by reducing complex graphs into low-dimensional vectors.
Graph neural networks (GNN) have drawn significant attentions in recent years due to their powerful representativeness. Its outstanding performance relies upon message passing among neighboring vertices and the powerful expressiveness of the neural network. GNN has been widely used in networked systems and applications, like gross merchandise value forecast in e-commerce graph<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, item recommendation in knowledge graphs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and docked bike prediction in spatial-temporal bike-sharing networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The growing awareness of data privacy and the formal establishment of regulations such as GDPR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and CCPA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> motivate a new paradigm called Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Instead of training neural network models on a server that stores all the data, FL trains models on local devices without uploading private data to the server.
The server only receives the individually trained models and aggregates them to derive a global one. Along with efforts to protect typical sequence-like or grid-like data, e.g., texts and images, topological information such as node degree in graph data also calls for stricter privacy protection as they usually embed essential personal information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated GNN aims to collaboratively train the GNN with privacy preservation of graph data.
Existing federated GNN studies can be categorized into the following three types, depending on how much graph information each device has:
(1) Graph-level separation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> allows each client to have a complete graph with common nodes but different node features and edges. It usually models the collaboration among different organizations with different graph data. (2) Subgraph-level separation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> splits a graph into small subgraphs and each device stores one subgraph. It is applicable in recommendation user-item networks. (3) Node-level separation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> only allows each device to hold its own ego-network, namely, each device is only aware of the connection information between itself and its direct neighbors. It is the most natural form in sensor networks, social networks, and the emerging decentralized applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Different levels of separation demand specific designs of federated systems. The limited availability of the structure information in a node-separated graph greatly hinders the capacity of the graph learning.
Up till now,
although existing federated GNN models are capable of learning graph representations while protecting local feature data in node-separated settings, they all leave the critical local node degree exposed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims to fill the gap to fully protect local feature and node degree in the node-level federated setting. The challenges come from three perspectives. First, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">learning</span>. Inaccessibility of the complete graph information significantly limits the structural awareness of each device. Obtaining representative node embeddings in such a strict environment calls for a new federated GNN design.
Second, <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy</span>. Node features, as well as node degree, all require privacy protection.
How to protect these information from other clients and the central server, preferably being theoretically guaranteed, is non-trivial.
Last but not least, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">degree heterogeneity.</span> Skewed degree distribution in real-world graphs lead to heterogeneous sizes of ego networks across different devices. Directly computing on these ego networks makes certain devices stragglers, and thus prolongs the whole training process.
How to mitigate the effect of stragglers caused by the degree heterogeneity should be addressed.</p>

Each device then considers the constructed tree as a graph to represent GNN layers.
The tree-based GNN trainer is further proposed to train those trees to learn the representation of vertices in the global graph with privacy preserved.
A fully decentralized inter-device communication scheme facilitates the aggregation of the embeddings of the same nodes in different devices. Devices then use the aggregated embeddings to compute the loss and improve the neural network.

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Federated learning paradigm has advanced in the last few years since it successfully tackles the data privacy issue in machine learning algorithms<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Through the collaboration of neural network training, federated learning trains models without the centralization of raw datasets. However, federated learning suffers performance degradation due to various types of heterogeneity, like data distribution heterogeneity<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and resource heterogeneity<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
To address these types of heterogeneity, a federated learning system usually modifies the default model aggregation protocol or client sampling strategy through heuristic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and clustering algorithms.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, researchers theoretically prove that learning rate decay can resolve the non-iidness of data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, researchers propose an experience-driven algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to solve a mobile computational resource heterogeneity problem in federated learning. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a clustering-based FL framework is proposed to tackle the network communication heterogeneity problem. However, the characteristics of graph data lead to a new type of heterogeneity, like the skewed distribution of node degrees and different levels of graph sparsity, which is difficult to handle using previous approaches.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph neural networks have emerged as an efficient tool for graph learning. Various neural architectures are introduced to generate node embeddings and fulfill graph-related tasks, such as GCN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, GAT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and GraphSage<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, these GNN architectures suffer from limited expressiveness due to the message-passing framework in vanilla GNNs, validated by the incapability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and difficulty in approximating combinatorial problems<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome this shortage, scientists have modified the message-passing framework so that features can be extracted and aggregated in a new manner. One way is to reconstruct the graph structure by adding virtual nodes. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, researchers append virtual nodes to the graph to form junction trees to improve the expressive power of GNN. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, a new GNN architecture called Neural Tree operates message passing on H-tree constructed from the original graph by linking virtual nodes to actual nodes.
Similar to these studies, in our problem, the limited expressive power of vanilla GNN architectures makes embedding nodes in small ego networks inaccurate. Therefore, we also modify the ego network to improve representativeness.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated graph learning collaboratively trains the GNN in a privacy-preserving way. True structural information and raw feature information are not allowed to share with other devices and the server.
Separation of graph statistics across different devices greatly impedes the model training and affects the GNN’s representativeness.
Various frameworks have been proposed under different levels of separation to tackle the problem.

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In graph-level separation, each client owns one or more complete graphs with common vertices but different features or connection information. GCFL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> clusters local graphs using gradients of GNN networks to improve overall performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, FedGL takes advantage of prediction results and node embeddings to facilitate global graph self-supervision to address varying node label distribution, different graph sparsity, and non-iid node feature problems.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For subgraph-level separation, each device owns a subgraph of the global graph. FedSage+ in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> utilizes a missing neighbor generator on top of the system to deal with missing links across subgraphs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, FedGraph uses a novel cross-client convolution operation to address feature data sharing among devices and an intelligent graph sampling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to balance training speed and accuracy. Researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose a practical federated graph learning system that deals with the trade-off among GCN convergence error, wall-clock runtime, and neighbor sampling interval.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For node-level separation, each client only owns an ego network from itself. Namely, each client is only aware of its direct neighbors and the edges to its neighbors.
SGNN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> uses one-hot encoding to encrypt features and introduces a new node distance calculation method based on an ordered degree list to process structural information.
LPGNN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> encrypts local features using a modified one-bit encoder and a robust training framework to increase inference accuracy in the presence of noisy labels. These works focus on protecting local features, but leaves the edge information exposed. A recent work, FedWalk in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, modifies Deepwalk method in centralized settings to protect edge information. However, the system is limited in representativeness as GNN outperforms DeepWalk. We focus on designing a federated GNN system while protecting both feature and degree. We also reveal a new workload imbalance problem caused by degree heterogeneity in node-separated setting, and propose a theoretically-proved approximation algorithm to solve it.</p>

Since the devices in practice usually have limited computing power and storage resources, directly computing on these ego networks makes some devices run slower than others, also known as stragglers in distributed systems, and thus prolongs the whole training process. Furthermore, the imbalanced workload caused by degree heterogeneity also introduces high computation costs on certain edge devices. Hence, the system should be wisely designed by reducing the size of large local graphs to avoid excessive communication and computation costs.<span id="S4.SS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></p>

Then we add a common parent node to the two leaves in each pair to join them. Last, we use a root node to make all the parent nodes children of the root node in the tree. This tree architecture includes virtual nodes representing subgraphs in the original graph. The virtual root node represents the whole ego network, and each virtual parent node of leaves refers to a two-vertex subgraph, including its two child vertices and the edge between them. These virtual nodes allow the tree to express more structural information about the original ego network.

Although it is difficult to find the exact solution, we propose a method to approximate the optimal solution.
Our method consists of two parts, one is a greedy initialization algorithm to trim branches into a sub-optimal tree, and the other is an iterative algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We prove this heterogeneity-aware tree trimming method has bounded loss compared to the optimal solution.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.3" class="ltx_p">Realizing this simple setting is non-trivial in our scenario, requiring a integer comparison to compare two degrees. Since the degree value reveals structural information of the vertex, it needs privacy preservation.
We use the 2-party protocol for integer comparison problem in CrypTFlow2<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> due to its efficiency and decentralized setting. <span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text">Other degree protection mechanisms such as graph anonymization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> require complete graph structure on the server. This is inaccessible in our federated scenario because it leaks the local graph neighboring information to the server.<span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.3.3.3" class="ltx_text">
Taking the logarithm of degrees makes the bits of inter-transmission during secure integer comparison much smaller. It also reduces the unnecessary workload for vertex pairs with a slight degree value difference. The initial solution fills the workload gap between two devices with a significant degree difference. The initialization process can be summarized in Alg.<a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Greedy initialization ‣ V-C A Solution to Workload Balancing Problem: Heterogeneity-aware Tree Trimming ‣ V Heterogeneity-Aware Tree Constructor ‣ Lumos: Heterogeneity-aware Federated Graph Learning over Decentralized Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

Each device first checks whether it is a candidate vertex by comparing its workload with the workloads of its neighboring devices. If it undertakes the largest workload across its ego network, it sends a message to the server. After the server receives all the candidate vertices, it executes the second part. It requests all the devices in CVS to compare themselves with each other. The device with the largest workload among the candidates is expected and informs the server. If more than one device are found, the server randomly selects one as they have the same maximum workloads.

We describe embedding initialization, message passing and loss computing, all key components in GNN training, in details sequentially.
In general, after balancing the computation workloads for each device, each device now has a tree-structured graph of an adequate size, which allows graph neural network training. Every device performs message passing on its tree, including all the leaves and internal nodes.

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated GNN is an important learning problem that studies efficient graph data processing in privacy preserving environment. Existing studies on federated GNN seldom protect the local node degree.
We propose the first federated GNN framework, called <span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Lumos</span>, to protect graph statistics in a node-separated setting. We design a novel tree constructor to enhance the expressive power of the original ego network. We propose a MCMC-based algorithm to balance the workload across different devices. We design a tree-based GNN trainer to train the constructed tree with features protected. Experiments have shown that our model outperforms the state-of-art framework in accuracy and system footprints. <span id="S9.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Lumos</span> satisfies the most natural graph data privacy need in mobile applications and systems, and with a great potential in the emerging decentralized applications.
