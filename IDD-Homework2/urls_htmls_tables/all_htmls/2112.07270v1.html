<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Answering semantically-complicated questions according to an image is challenging in Visual Question Answering (VQA) task.
Although the image can be well represented by deep learning, the question is always simply embedded and cannot well indicate its meaning.
Besides, the visual and textual features have a gap for different modalities, it is difficult to align and utilize the cross-modality information.
In this paper, we focus on these two problems and propose a Graph Matching Attention (<span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span>) network.
Firstly, it not only builds graph for the image, but also constructs graph for the question in terms of both syntactic and embedding information.
Next, we explore the intra-modality relationships by a dual-stage graph encoder and then present a bilateral cross-modality graph matching attention to infer the relationships between the image and the question.
The updated cross-modality features are then sent into the answer prediction module for final answer prediction.
Experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GQA dataset and the VQA 2.0 dataset. The ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each modules in our <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> network.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given a visual image, the goal of Visual Question Answering (VQA) is to correctly answer a relative natural language question. It requires a comprehensive cross-modality understanding and visual-semantic reasoning between images and questions. VQA plays an important role and has a wide potential application in the future life, such as virtual assistants and autonomous agents.
Therefore, it has aroused extensive interest from both vision and natural language communities.
With the explosive progress of deep neural networks (DNN), a large amount of deep learning methods, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> BUTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and Pythia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, have been developed for better representation learning. These feature representations have been introduced into VQA and efficiently improved the performance of existing algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, plenty of VQA studies focused on relational reasoning. The attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which is capable to encapsulate the most relevant information from the image or the question, has been adopted for relation reasoning.
BAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and DFAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> designed a variety of attentions to explore the implicit relationship between the image and question domain, and their effects are remarkable. These VQA frameworks adopted simple attention mechanisms, learning the ”black-box” relationships in an agnostic dimensional feature space without underlying restrictions. The arbitrariness increased the risk of over-fitting and limited high-level relational reasoning. Besides, some recently works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> concentrated on learning an explicit visual semantic relationship in an image via Visual Relation Detection (VRD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To some extent, this kind of frameworks put forward a new possible direction for solving the relational reasoning in the VQA task, but they increased uncertainty of the model, making the performance heavily dependent on the relationship learning algorithms.
In addition, predominant approaches of VQA focused on learning a joint cross-modality representation to represent the alignment between the image region and the corresponding question.
Specifically, bilinear fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> exploited bilinear pooling to capture pairwise interactions among the modalities.
Some sophisticated schemes, including MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, MLB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and MUTAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which designed different linear fusion strategies, demonstrated better performances and less computational burden than Bilinear Fusion.
Nevertheless, modern fusion methods carried out feature alignment in the absence of modal structure (e.g. positional relationships of the image regions, and grammatical relationships of the question) and output one monolithic vector unable to describe fine-grained information for both visual and language semantics.
As a result, the alternatives almost produced a sub-optimal solution leading to imperfect cross-modality feature representation.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The graph method is generally known as using a topological data structure to express complex relationships between nodes. In VQA, several graph-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> were proposed and shown great improvement in visual understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. They leveraged topology to the subtle context information in order to remedy the defect of Euclidean distance in relationship inference. The drawbacks lie in the ignorance of the syntactic relationship of the language modality and mere consideration of visual information. This is a serious problem for VQA model understanding.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Graph Matching Attention (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span>) network to solve the problems of unsuitable question description and the alignment between the visual and textual modality information.
As shown in Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
our network constructs two graph data structures, to depict the positional geometry of image regions and syntactic structure of the question, respectively.
In the view of the topological information, the graph patterns for both the two modalities bring about convincing relational reasoning in cross-modality understanding.
To solve the shortcoming of the traditional attention mechanisms applied in VQA, we propose the <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> module to develop a more intuitive relational reasoning. Based on the visual and textual graphs, the <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> module guides to align the attention across the two modalities.
We firstly explore information relationships inside the visual and textual modalities respectively, by a dual-stage graph encoder to represent the relationships of the nodes explicitly and implicitly. The graph encoder in our <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> produces meaningful internal relationships in the image and the question, separately, improving the attention interpretation.
Then, the intra-modality features are forward into the graph matching attention modules to align and pass information between visual and textual features in a bilateral manner.
By practicing the graph matching between the visual and texture graph patterns, each node is capable to adopt a feature fusion inference from the multi-modality representations, rather than a monolithic feature in previous works.
Furthermore, the <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> contributes to the performance with the participation of multi-modality structural information.
Finally, each graph feature is weighted by the bilateral cross-modality attention and sent to the answer prediction module to calculate the score for the potential answers.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, as shown in Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> utilizes the Graph Convolutional Networks (<span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GCNs</span>) to successively capture the explicit and implicit relations among the nodes inside each modal (the red arrows in Graph Match Attention module).
These relational features reveal fine-grained intra-modality concepts and provide a holistic view of modal interpretation.
Next, a pairwise matching (the yellow dashed arrows linking visual and question graph nodes) is applied to inter-modality nodes, and attaches the semantic alignment.
The graph matching operations dynamically update the nodes and pass information flows within each modality to capture higher-order inter-modality relations. In this way, every node aggregates the attention-weighted information from the other instances under the guidance of graph structure. Besides, the <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> modules can be stacked and explore a deeper level semantic relationship.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging problem, which involves two fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The VQA task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> requires that the trained model can answer any natural language questions of a given image.
In real application scenarios, it usually becomes a multimedia answering task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and can also be directly applied to the multi-modal dialog system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Current algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> for VQA task are usually designed as a multi-label classification problem, which makes the neural network infer answers in a limited set of classes. The current mainstream VQA framework is usually composed of image encoder, question encoder, multi-modal features fusion module, and answer predictor. Feature learning is an essential part of VQA algorithms. Due to the success of deep representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, BUTD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> derived from Faster RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the performance of VQA has been greatly improved.
Recently, the researchers pay more attention to the relational reasoning of VQA task. Specifically, Murel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed to stack several layers of attention to gradually focus on the most important regions.
ReGAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed graph-based attention mechanisms to learn the relational semantics between the visual and language modalities.
Stacked attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Co-attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> based approaches inferred visual and textual attention distributions for each modality. BAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> inferred a bilinear attention distribution between two modalities. DFAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> integrated cross-modality self-attention and co-attention mechanisms to achieve effective information flows within and between two modalities.
Besides, some recent algorithms attempted to solve the problem of multi-modality feature fusion in VQA. MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, MLB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and MUTAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> designed different bilinear fusion strategies to fuse the cross-modality features. In addition, some popular methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> begin to design different data augmentation algorithms to enhance the effect of VQA model.
Those methods have proved useful for the VQA task, but there are still some unsolved issues, such as the alignment between the two modalities and the absence of the structural information of each modality.
In this paper, we construct two graphs to respectively represent the geometry relationship of image regions and the syntactic structure of its question. A graph matching attention module is designed to successively align and fuse the visual and textual features, in order to learn the semantic representation for final answer prediction.</p>

 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed the HDWE model to address click feature prediction from visual features for Fine-grained Image Recognition.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed SPE-VLAD layer to reflect the structural information of the images for place recognition.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed multi-step reasoning models NMNs that built question-specific layouts. Based on NMNs, Stack-NMN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> algorithm was proposed to practice more effective multi-step reasoning. FiLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> modulated an image representation with the given question via conditional batch normalization, and was extended by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> with a multi-step reasoning procedure, where both modalities can modulate each other. MAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> performed multi-step reasoning while recording information in its memory. QGHC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> predicted question-dependent convolution kernels to modulate visual features. In addition, recently proposed methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> applied various attention mechanisms in reasoning framework to enhance the learning of implicit relational semantics. Given a question, these models assigned an importance score to each region, and employed them to weight-sum pool the visual representations. The attention mechanism has been proved to be effective in solving the problem of relational reasoning in the VQA task, but only learning the implicit relations is insufficient.
It is necessary for the VQA model to learn explicit relations according to the structural information of each modality. In order to enhance the relational reasoning ability, we propose a novel graph match attention mechanism to learn the relational semantics between the image and the question by combining with the designed graph matching method.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph Matching  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> is a fundamental problem that aims to establish the node correspondences among multiple graphs and has been widely studied in computer vision and pattern recognition areas. To find the maximal similarity between the matched graphs, both the unitary similarity between nodes and pairwise similarity edges from separate graphs are integrated in graph matching methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Naturally, graph matching can encode the high-order geometric information in the matching process so that it can be used to model complex relationships and more diverse transformations.
Because of the expressiveness and robustness, graph matching relates to many computer vision problems, such as visual tracking, motion recognition, image classification, and so on.
Recently, researchers began to use the deep features in geometric and semantic visual matching tasks. GMNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposed Graph Matching Networks for learning the similarity of graph-structured objects. CLKGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed a topic entity graph to represent the knowledge graph context information of an entity and estimated the similarity of two graphs by using the designed attentive-matching method. DLGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> proposed an end-to-end graph matching model that integrates node feature extraction, node/edge affinities learning and matching optimization together in a unified network.
PCAGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> explored Graph Convolutional Networks for graph matching task.
In this paper, we involve the graph matching algorithms to combine the visual features of the image with the semantic features of the question so as to align the two different feature sub-spaces and learn the high-level cross-modality relations to reasoning the answers of the questions.</p>

Firstly, we build graph structures for both the image and the question to maximize retention of intra-modality relationships in graph construction module (section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Graph Construction ‣ III Our method ‣ Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>).

Finally, the reasoning features from the <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> module are aggregated with the textual feature, and fed into the answer prediction module (section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Answer Prediction Layer ‣ III Our method ‣ Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>) for the final answer.</p>

In order to build the edge connections, dominant literature leveraged a fully-connected graph to learn arbitrary implicit relations under complex attention mechanisms. However, fully-connected architecture loses explicit topology information and inclines to rapidly trapped in over-smoothing during deep graph network training. Therefore,

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Rather than fusing the visual and question features directly in previous works, the proposed Graph Matching Attention (<span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span>) learns the bilateral matching relationships between the visual and textual graphs, and aligns them by passing the cross-modal information to each other.
Inside the <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> module, each graph node can be updated after receiving the cross-modal attention.
The <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GMA</span> module can be stacked for deeper level of semantic relationship features.

The visual graph and question graph are constructed from two different modal spaces and have different topological structures, so there is a gap between them.
Our dual-stage graph encoder transforms both graph features into the same graph matching subspace.
Inside the encoder, we apply cascaded graph convolutional layers to successively infer the explicit and implicit relations inside each graph.
The meaning of explicit stage is information aggregation and relational reasoning between graph nodes based on the clear spatial relationship in visual graph and syntactic relationship in question graph. However, the meaning of implicit stage is to infer according to the similarity relationship between graph node features, which further makes up for the insufficient reasoning of explicit stage.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">After the dual-stage graph encoder module, the bilateral matching attention module is proposed for cross-modal information interaction between two graphs. The nodes of the visual graph represent the visual features of all objects detected in the image, while the nodes of the question graph are the related word features of some specific objects in the question sentence. The two different modal features need to be aligned first, and then further fused, so as to achieve more accurate reasoning in the process of cross-model interaction. Inspired by the idea of graph matching algorithm, the proposed bilateral matching attention module first performs the matching operation between two graphs, and then the designed attention algorithm according to the matching scores to complete the cross-modal feature fusion and relational reasoning.
The proposed matching attention sub-module consists of a graph matching layer and a bilateral cross-modality attention layer. In the graph matching layer, an affinity matching function <math id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f_{a}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub

Each question has 10 answers labeled by 10 AMT workers. The sizes of <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">train</span> split, the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">val</span> split and the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test</span> split are 443,757, 214,354 and 447,739, respectively.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">GQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> is a new dataset for the Visual Question Answering task over real-world images.
Compared with VQA 2.0 dataset, GQA needs more reasoning skills, such as spatial understanding, multi-step reasoning, and so on. In the GQA dataset, 52% of the questions need the trained model to understand the visual relationship and conduct relational reasoning.
The effectiveness of our model can be verified directly by reasoning on these complex questions.
Apart from the standard <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Accuracy</span> metric measured on several different categories of questions, the dataset also provides some other metrics to better evaluate the performance of the model. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Consistency</span> metric is used to measure the level of consistency in responses across different questions. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Validity</span> metric measures whether the model gives valid answers, ones that can be theoretically correct for the question. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Plausibility</span> metric measures whether the model responses are reasonable in the real world or not making sense. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Distribution</span> metric measures the difference between the predicted answer distribution and the ground truth.</p>

Next, we map those words into a sequence of GloVe word embedding features and also use the Bi-GRU module to extract the features </span><math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{V}^{n}\in\mathbb{R}^{K_{2}\times 2048}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml"><mi mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝑽</mi><mi mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.3.cmml">n</mi></msup><mo mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml"><mi mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.cmml"><mi mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.2.cmml">K</mi><mn mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo lspace="0.222em" mathsize="90%" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mn mathsize="90%" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">2048</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1"><in id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1"></in><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.2">𝑽</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.3">𝑛</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3"><times id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.2">𝐾</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.2.3">2</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.3.3">2048</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.m9.1c">\bm{V}^{n}\in\mathbb{R}^{K_{2}\times 2048}</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.9.22" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">.</span></p>

Compared with the default setting, the performance without the Dual-Stage Graph Encoder decreases by 0.44%, reflecting the significant role of intra-modality reasoning. Because the Bilateral Matching Attention sub-module can intuitively align features between the visual and language modalities, the attention could learn better relational semantics depending on the graph matching operation.

As shown in the 7th component of Table </span><a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Experimental Implementation ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref" style="font-size:90%;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a><span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.15" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">, the result of the Explicit Stage Graph Encoder was improved by 0.31% due to that the explicit structure information in the two modalities can be integrated into each graph node.
Besides, merely using the Implicit Stage Graph Encoder, the performance improves 0.28%.
Since the implicit relationships between each graph node have been learned, the performance can be promoted by the matching attention sub-module.
Moreover, the Dual-stage Graph Encoder can be enhanced by 0.43%, indicating the complementarity between the explicit and the implicit graph structure information.</span></p>

Our network not only uses the whole question embedding feature, but also analyze the syntax structure of question and constructs the question graph. We apply the graph-structure representation in both the visual and textual modalities. Then, the Graph Matching Attention module learns the relationships inside the visual and textual features and propagates the cross-modality information mutually.
By stacking multiple blocks of </span><span id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:90%;">GMA</span><span id="S5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">, the inference ability will be enhanced on the VQA benchmarks. The experimental data and the attention-based visualization provide strong evidence that our model has the capability in multi-modal feature fusion and relation reasoning.</span></p>
