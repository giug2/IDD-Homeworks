<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a game theoretic framework for participation and free-riding in federated learning (FL), and determines the Nash equilibrium strategies when FL is executed over wireless links. To support spectrum sensing for NextG communications, FL is used by clients, namely spectrum sensors with limited training datasets and computation resources, to train a wireless signal classifier while preserving privacy. In FL, a client may be free-riding, i.e., it does not participate in FL model updates, if the computation and transmission cost for FL participation is high, and receives the global model (learned by other clients) without incurring a cost. However, the free-riding behavior may potentially decrease the global accuracy due to lack of contribution to global model learning. This tradeoff leads to a non-cooperative game where each client aims to individually maximize its utility as the difference between the global model accuracy and the cost of FL participation. The Nash equilibrium strategies are derived for free-riding probabilities such that no client can unilaterally increase its utility given the strategies of its opponents remain the same. The free-riding probability increases with the FL participation cost and the number of clients, and a significant optimality gap exists in Nash equilibrium with respect to the joint optimization for all clients. The optimality gap increases with the number of clients and the maximum gap is evaluated as a function of the cost. These results quantify the impact of free-riding on the resilience of FL in NextG networks and indicate operational modes for FL participation.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</em> (FL) allows a set of clients to collectively train a global machine learning model without sharing their individual training datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In orchestration by a server, each client in FL shares its trained local model with the server and the server aggregates these models and shares the aggregated global model back with the clients. Then, the clients initialize their local models with this global model and train these models using their own training data samples. By repeating this process over multiple epochs, a global model is trained in this client-server framework.
FL provides various benefits: (i) Since the training datasets are not shared in FL, clients can preserve the privacy of their training datasets. (ii) Since the trained models are typically smaller than the training data, the communication load is reduced in FL compared to the case of sharing the data among clients and the server. (iii) Clients that may not have large training datasets or powerful computing resources can still collectively train a global model in FL by using their local training datasets and computing resources

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To reap these benefits of FL, clients may need incentives to participate in FL. Various incentive mechanisms such as those motivated by game theory have been studied to foster collaboration for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Also, it is possible for clients to decide with whom they participate in FL by forming federating coalitions to balance the performance of local and global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, FL
is also susceptible to various insider exploits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> such as (i) data poisoning
(training datasets are manipulated by malicious clients), (ii) model update poisoning (models are manipulated by malicious clients before sharing with the server), and (iii) inference of class representatives, memberships, and training inputs and labels. One particular client behavior of concern is <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free-riding</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where some clients may not contribute to the FL model updates, but they may receive the global model from the server (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Free-Rider Games for Federated Learning with Selfish Clients in NextG Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). While there may be a benign reason that the free-riding client does not have training data to contribute to the FL model updates, there may be also selfish reason that this client may avoid incurring the cost of spending its communication and computation resources, or a malicious reason that this client may aim to steal the global model.</p>

FL can be performed over wireless links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and multi-hop wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In these cases, clients may refrain from participating in the FL model updates to preserve their energy that would be spent for wireless transmissions to share the FL model updates (especially when clients are battery-operated). The cost for participating in FL increases linearly with the number of epochs used in FL, where each client participating in FL spends energy and resources for locally training its deep neural network model as well as for transmitting its model update back to the server as an uplink transmission in each epoch. On the other hand, a free-riding client does not incur these costs, as it only receives the model updates from the server without any need of training the local model and transmitting the model updates to the server.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While free-riding clients avoid these costs, their selfish behavior adversely affects the global server accuracy and consequently the performance of other clients. In particular, the gains from getting information from the server (namely, the global server accuracy) is reduced when some clients are not participating in FL, as they do not contribute to the global model learning with their individual data. Thus, there is a trade-off that leads to the conflicting interests of selfish clients when they assume the roles as participating in FL model updates (called ‘participant’) or free-riding without participating in FL model updates (called ‘free-rider’).</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper formulates these conflicting interests as a <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-cooperative free-rider game</em> among clients involved in FL. Each client is a player and individually selects to be a participant or a free-rider as its action. The strategy of each client is the probability of selecting to be a free-rider. The reward is the global server accuracy and a cost is associated with participating in FL model updates. The utility (payoff) of each client is computed as the difference of the reward and the cost, and it is individually maximized given the strategies (free-riding probabilities) of other clients.</p>

A real-world scenario is the 3.5GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, where the incumbent user (namely, radar) and 5G communications co-exist in the same spectrum band. The spectrum sensors of the Environment Sensing Capability (ESC) need to detect the incumbent signal and inform the Spectrum Access System (SAS) to configure 5G communications and prevent interference with the incumbent signal. Spectrum sensors can use a deep learning model to detect signals of interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Each sensor may have limited training data and processing power, and may not share the data to keep communication load low and/or preserve data privacy (as spectrum sensors may monitor different geographical areas with different levels of privacy requirements). Thus, FL can be applied to train the deep learning model by utilizing training datasets collected at different locations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

The free-riding probabilities in Nash equilibrium increase with the cost and the number of clients involved in FL participation. In the meantime, the corresponding utility in Nash equilibrium is measured and the optimality gap is evaluated relative to the case when the total utility is maximized by selecting the free-riding probabilities jointly. The optimality gap increases with the number of clients and the cost for which the optimality gap reaches its maximum is identified. Also, the <em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fictitious play</em> is considered, where each client plays the best response to the empirical distributions of opponent strategies over time (without knowing their utilities).

<br class="ltx_break">Overall, the results presented in this paper quantify the resilience of FL to free-riding in a non-cooperative setting, when FL is applied to the wireless signal classification task, and indicate operational modes for clients to participate in FL model updates, when FL is performed over wireless links with associated costs for computing and transmitting.

With participation in FL model updates, a client may incur a cost for consuming energy for computation and transmission, while it may end with higher global model accuracy by contributing to the model updates. With free-riding, a client does not incur a cost, but may end up with lower accuracy as it does not contribute to the aggregate model of the server.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper formulated a game theoretic framework to analyze the free-riding behavior of selfish clients in FL. The free-riding probabilities were derived as the Nash equilibrium strategies when FL is executed over wireless links subject to computation and transmission costs. A non-cooperative game was set up among selfish clients that may assume roles of participating in the FL model updates or free-riding (i.e., receiving the global model without participating). By incorporating the reward (global model accuracy) and the (communication and computation) cost for each client, the utility to be maximized by each client was determined depending on the client’s assumed role. The Nash equilibrium strategies were compared to the globally optimal (cooperative) strategies to evaluate the optimality gap. The free-rider game was also set up as the fictitious play, where each client plays the game in response to the empirical frequency of past actions of other clients. This game formulation was applied to the case when FL trains a wireless signal classifier. The results quantified the increase of the free-riding probabilities in Nash equilibrium with the participation cost and the number of clients involved in FL, and characterized the optimality gap that increases with the number of clients. These results indicate operational modes for FL participation by quantifying the impact of free-riding on the resilience of FL in NextG wireless networks.</p>
