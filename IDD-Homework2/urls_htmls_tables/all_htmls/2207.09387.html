<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">The practical deployment of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks requires balancing energy efficiency, convergence rate, and a target accuracy due to the limited available resources of devices.
Prior art on FL often trains deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve high accuracy and fast convergence using 32 bits of precision level. However, such scenarios will be impractical for resource-constrained devices since DNNs typically have high computational complexity and memory requirements. Thus, there is a need to reduce the precision level in DNNs to reduce the energy expenditure.
In this paper, a green-quantized FL framework, which represents data with a finite precision level in both local training and uplink transmission, is proposed. Here, the finite precision level is captured through the use of quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and activations in fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device trains its QNN and transmits a quantized training result to the base station. Energy models for the local training and the transmission with quantization are rigorously derived. To minimize the energy consumption and the number of communication rounds simultaneously, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with respect to the number of local iterations, the number of selected devices, and the precision levels for both local training and transmission while ensuring convergence under a target accuracy constraint. To solve this problem, the convergence rate of the proposed FL system is analytically derived with respect to the system control variables. Then, the Pareto boundary of the problem is characterized to provide efficient solutions using the normal boundary inspection method. Design insights on balancing the tradeoff between the two objectives while achieving a target accuracy are drawn from using the Nash bargaining solution and analyzing the derived convergence rate. Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can reduce energy consumption until convergence by up to 70% compared to a baseline FL algorithm that represents data with full precision without damaging the convergence rate.</p>

Moreover, to achieve fast convergence, these networks typically represent data in 32 bits of full precision level, which may consume significant energy due to high computational complexity and memory requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Additionally, a large <abbr title="deep neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">DNN</span></abbr> can induce a significant communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

To design an energy-efficient, green <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> scheme, one can reduce the precision level to decrease the energy consumption during the local training and communication phase.

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> developed an approach to minimize the training time by optimizing transmission precision level and bandwidth allocation.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors studied an energy minimization problem by controlling local iterations, bandwidth allocation, and precision level for both local training and transmission under full device participation scheme. However, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> only considered the communication efficiency while there can be a large energy consumption in local training due to high precision level. Although the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> considered quantization for both local training and transmission, it used full device participation scheme, which is not practical due to stragglers, and only the energy consumption is minimized. In our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, an energy minimization problem was formulated to investigate the tradeoff between energy, precision, and accuracy. However, the same precision level was used for local training and transmission as done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. As such, the results of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> cannot be directly applied for more general cases such as those with heterogeneous devices and non-i.i.d datasets. Moreover, the number of local iterations and the number of selected devices were not jointly optimized. To the best of our knowledge, there are no current works that jointly consider the tradeoff between energy efficiency, convergence rate, and accuracy while simultaneously controlling local iterations, the number of scheduled devices, and precision levels in local training and transmission for green <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> over wireless networks.</p>

Thus, there is a need for a new approach to analyze the tradeoff between energy efficiency, convergence rate, and target accuracy by optimizing the precision levels. To this end, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem by controlling the precision levels to jointly minimize the total energy consumption and the number of communication rounds while ensuring convergence with a target accuracy. We also incorporate two additional control variables: the number of local iterations and the number of selected devices at each communication round, which have a significant impact on both the energy consumption and the convergence time.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Solving problem (<a href="#S2.E2" title="In II System Model ‣ Green, Quantized Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: An Energy-Efficient Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) typically requires an iterative process between the <abbr title="base station" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">BS</span></abbr> and devices. However, in practical systems, such as <abbr title="Internet of Things" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">IoT</span></abbr> systems, these devices are resource-constrained, particularly when it comes to computing and energy. Hence, we propose to manage the precision level of parameters used in our <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> algorithm to reduce the energy consumption for computation, memory access, and transmission. As such, we adopt a <abbr title="quantized neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">QNN</span></abbr> architecture whose weights and activations are quantized in fixed-point format rather than conventional 32-bit floating-point format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. During the training time, a <abbr title="quantized neural network" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">QNN</span></abbr> can reduce the energy consumption for <abbr title="multiply-accumulate" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">MAC</span></abbr> operation and memory access due to quantized weights and activations.</p>

For instance, we can reduce the amount of energy spent per iteration by using low precision and sampling a small number of devices. However, this slows the convergence rate because of quantization errors. Meanwhile, the system can allocate more bits and sample more devices to converge faster, i.e, to reduce the number of communication rounds, at the expense of spending more energy. However, this improvement becomes negligible after a certain threshold as shown later in the convergence analysis and simulations (see Theorem <a href="#A0.EGx18" title="Theorem 1. ‣ III Time and Energy efficient Federated ‣ Green, Quantized Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: An Energy-Efficient Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Green, Quantized Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: An Energy-Efficient Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. Hence, finding the optimal solutions is important to balance this tradeoff and to achieve the target accuracy.</p>

<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Since we have two conflicting objective functions, it is infeasible to find a global optimal solution to minimize each objective function simultaneously. Although introducing a weighted sum of the objective functions might provide a unique solution, its optimality is not always guaranteed. We also need to solve the problem again if those weights change. Hence, we instead consider the set of <em id="S3.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Pareto optimal points</em> to obtain an efficient collection of solutions to minimize each objective function and capture the tradeoff. It is known that the set of all Pareto optimal points forms a Pareto boundary in two-dimensional space. Therefore, we use the so-called normal boundary inspection (NBI) method since it provides evenly distributed Pareto optimal points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

For CNN3, the energy cost increased significantly since its large model size cannot be fit into the SRAM even after quantization.

This is because the quantization error increases for larger neural networks, as per Lemma <a href="#Thmlemma1" title="Lemma 1. ‣ II-A Quantized Neural Networks ‣ II System Model ‣ Green, Quantized Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: An Energy-Efficient Design" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Hence, the <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> system allocates more bits for both the computation and the transmission so as to mitigate the quantization error. This, in turn, means that the use of larger neural networks will naturally require more energy, even if the neural network is quantized.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the problem of energy-efficient quantized <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> over wireless networks. We have presented the energy model for our <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> based on the physical structure of a processing chip considering the quantization. Then, we have formulated a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption and the number of communication rounds simultaneously under a target accuracy by controlling the number of local iterations, the number of selected users, the precision levels for the transmission, and the training. To solve this problem, we first have derived the convergence rate of our quantized <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>. Based on it, we have used the <abbr title="normal boundary inspection" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">NBI</span></abbr> method to obtain the Pareto boundary. We also have derived analytical solutions that can optimize each objective function separately. Simulation results have validated our theoretical analysis and provided design insights with two practical operating points. We have also shown that our model requires much less energy than a standard <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> model and the baselines to achieve the convergence.
In essence, this work provides the first systematic study on how to optimally design quantized <abbr title="federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> balancing the tradeoff between energy efficiency and convergence rate, and the target accuracy over wireless networks.</p>
