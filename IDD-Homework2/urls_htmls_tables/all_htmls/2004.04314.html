<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies federated learning (FL) in a classic wireless network, where learning clients share a common wireless link to a coordinating server to perform federated model training using their local data. In such wireless federated learning networks (WFLNs), optimizing the learning performance depends crucially on how clients are selected and how bandwidth is allocated among the selected clients in every learning round, as both radio and client energy resources are limited. While existing works have made some attempts to allocate the limited wireless resources to optimize FL, they focus on the problem in individual learning rounds, overlooking an inherent yet critical feature of federated learning. This paper brings a new long-term perspective to resource allocation in WFLNs, realizing that learning rounds are not only temporally interdependent but also have varying significance towards the final learning outcome. To this end, we first design data-driven experiments to show that different temporal client selection patterns lead to considerably different learning performance. With the obtained insights, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for joint client selection and bandwidth allocation under long-term client energy constraints, and develop a new algorithm that utilizes only currently available wireless channel information but can achieve long-term performance guarantee. Further experiments show that our algorithm results in the desired temporal client selection pattern, is adaptive to changing network environments and far outperforms benchmarks that ignore the long-term effect of FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile devices nowadays generate a massive amount of data each day. This rich data has the potential to power a wide range of machine learning (ML)-based applications, such as learning the activities of smart phone users, predicting health events from wearable devices or adapting to pedestrian behavior in autonomous vehicles. Due to the growing storage and computational power of mobile devices as well as privacy concerns associated with uploading personal data, it is increasingly attractive to store and process data directly on each mobile device. The aim of “federated learning” (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is to enable mobile devices to collaboratively learn a shared ML model with the coordination of a central server while keeping all the training data on device, thereby decoupling the ability to do ML from the need to upload/store the data in the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on FL in a classic wireless network setting where the clients, e.g., mobile devices, share a common wireless link to the server. We call this system a <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">wireless federated learning network</span> (WFLN). The network operates for a number of learning rounds as follows: in each round, the clients download the current ML model from the server, improve it by learning from their local data, and then upload the individual model updates to the server via the wireless link; the server then aggregates the local updates to improve the shared model. Similar to a traditional throughput-oriented wireless network, the limited wireless network resources require the WFLN to determine in each round which clients access the wireless channel to upload the model updates and how much bandwidth is allocated to each client. However, due to the specific application in consideration, namely FL, the resource allocation objective and consequently the outcome can be very different from, e.g., throughput maximization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Optimizing WFLNs faces unique challenges compared to optimizing either FL or the traditional wireless networks. On the one hand, the wireless network sets resource constraints on performing FL as the finite wireless bandwidth limits the number of clients that can be selected in each round, and the selection must be adaptive to the highly variable wireless channel conditions. On the other hand, FL is likely to change the way wireless networks should be optimized as model training is a complex <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">long-term</span> process where decisions across rounds are interdependent and collectively decide the final training performance. Further, since mobile devices often have finite energy budgets due to, e.g., a finite battery, the number of rounds each individual mobile device can participate during the entire course of FL is also limited. An extremely crucial yet largely overlooked question is: does learning in different rounds contribute the same or differently to the final learning outcome and hence should the wireless resources be allocated discrepantly across rounds? Without a good understanding of its answer, conventional wireless network optimization approaches that treat each time slot independently and equally may lead to considerably suboptimal FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims to formalize this fundamental problem of client selection and bandwidth allocation in WFLNs and derive critical knowledge to enable the efficient operation of these networks. We study how resources (i.e., bandwidth and energy) should be allocated among clients in each learning round as well as <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">across</span> rounds given finite client energy budgets in a volatile network environment. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(1) While existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have shown that including more clients in FL generally improves the learning performance, there is little understanding of how this improvement depends on the learning rounds. For a fixed total number of selected clients during the entire course of FL, should client selection be uniform across rounds or more biased toward the early/later FL rounds? Although analytical characterization seems extremely difficult, we show in two representative ML tasks, i.e., image classification and text generation, that selecting more clients in the later FL rounds not only achieves higher accuracy and lower training loss but also is more robust than selecting more clients in the early FL rounds. This finding, to our best knowledge, is the first that relates the temporal client selection pattern to the final FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(2) With the understanding of a desired temporal client selection pattern, we formulate a <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">long-term</span> client selection and bandwidth allocation problem for a finite number of FL rounds under finite energy constraints of individual clients. Because wireless channel conditions vary over time but future conditions are unpredictable, we leverage the Lyapunov technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to convert the long-term problem into a sequence of per-round problems via a virtual energy deficit queue for each client. A new online optimization algorithm called OCEAN is proposed, which in each FL round solves a finite number of convex optimization problems using only currently available wireless information, and hence the algorithm is practical and has low complexity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.2" class="ltx_p">(3) We prove that OCEAN achieves the FL performance of the desired client selection pattern within a bounded gap while approximately satisfying the energy constraints of the clients.

In addition, we investigate the structure of the client selection and bandwidth allocation outcome. Our findings are two-fold: in each round, clients are selected according to a priority metric, which is the ratio of the client’s current energy deficit queue length and its current wireless channel state. However, among the selected ones, more bandwidth is allocated to clients with a lower priority (i.e., worse channel and larger energy deficit queue length). This is in stark contrast to a traditional throughput-oriented wireless network where more bandwidth is allocated to clients with a better channel condition in order to maximize throughput.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the proposal of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a lot of research effort has been devoted to tackling various challenges in this new distributed machine learning framework, including developing new optimization and model aggregation algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, handling non-i.i.d. and unbalanced datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and preserving model privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> etc. Among these challenges, improving the communication efficiency of FL has been a key challenge due to the tension between uploading a large amount of data for model aggregation and the limited network resource to support this transmission. In this regard, a strand of literature focuses on modifying the FL algorithm itself to reduce the communication burden on the network, e.g., updating clients with significant training improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, compressing the gradient vectors via quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, or accelerating training using sparse or structured updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Hierarchical FL networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have also been proposed where multiple edge servers perform partial model aggregation first, whose outputs are further aggregated by a cloud server. Recognizing the unique physical property of wireless transmission, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> propose analog model aggregation over the air, provided that a very stringent synchronization is available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As wireless networks are the envisioned main deployment scenario of FL, how to optimally allocate the limited bandwidth and energy resources for FL has also received much attention. Many existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> study the inherent trade-off between local model update and global model aggregation, e.g., to adapt the frequency of global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> or to optimize uplink transmission power/rate and the local update CPU frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In all these works, all clients participate in every FL round. Although both empirical studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and theoretical analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> show that including more clients improves the FL convergence speed, the limited bandwidth of wireless networks cannot support many clients to upload their local updates at the same time. For FL at scale, client scheduling policies, which select only a subset of clients in every round, are necessary. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the convergence performance of FL under three basic scheduling policies, namely random, round-robin and proportional fair, is analyzed. Different types of joint bandwidth allocation and client scheduling policies, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, have been proposed to either minimize the learning loss or the training time. However, their optimization problems are formulated by considering individual FL rounds separately or treating every FL round equally, and hence the same network resources are allocated across learning rounds. Our paper differs from these works in that we explicitly consider the varying significance of FL rounds and study a long-term bandwidth allocation and client selection problem under long-term energy constraints and with uncertain wireless channel information.</p>

However, selecting more clients is not always possible if each client is subject to a long-term energy constraint due to, e.g., a finite battery: selecting more clients in early learning rounds depletes the battery of the clients and hence fewer clients can be selected in later learning rounds. Hence, even with the same average number of selected clients, the temporal pattern can be considerably different, yet there is little understanding of how the temporal pattern affects the final FL outcome. In this section, we design two experiments to show that the temporal client pattern indeed has a considerable impact on the final FL performance.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our first experiment is conducted using the TensorFlow Federated (TFF) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> on the MNIST dataset for image classification. A deep neural network (DNN) classifier is trained on 10 clients (index from 1 through 10) using the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> over a total of 300 rounds. Three temporal selection patterns are investigated: <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Uniform</span> – in each round, 5 clients are randomly selected to upload their model parameters; <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ascend</span> – the number of selected clients gradually increases from 1 to 10 over 300 rounds with an average number of 5 clients selected per round; <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Descend</span> – the number of selected clients gradually decreases from 10 to 1 over 300 rounds with an average number of 5 clients selected per round.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Figures <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III Impact of Temporal Client Selection Pattern ‣ Client Selection and Bandwidth Allocation in Wireless Federated Learning Networks: A Long-Term Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III Impact of Temporal Client Selection Pattern ‣ Client Selection and Bandwidth Allocation in Wireless Federated Learning Networks: A Long-Term Perspective" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrate the training loss and the prediction accuracy, respectively, over 300 rounds for the three temporal patterns. Each curve is generated by averaging over 60 runs and the standard deviation of these curves are also shown in the figures. As can be seen, although the average number of selected clients is the same, different temporal patterns result in different training loss and prediction accuracy by the end of the 300 rounds. In particular, <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ascend</span> results in the best performance compared to <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Uniform</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Descend</span>. There is a good reason behind this result: early learning rounds are “easy” rounds where the learning performance is less sensitive to the number of selected clients. Hence, even if <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ascend</span> selects fewer clients in the early rounds, learning speed is minimally affected. However, the later learning rounds are the more “difficult” rounds, and to push accuracy even higher requires more clients to update the shared model using their data. In fact, not only <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ascend</span> wins in training loss and accuracy, but it is also much more robust as the standard deviation is much smaller. This is again because more clients participate in model updating towards the end of learning, which can smooth out abrupt changes in the learned model of individual clients.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We note that the exact optimal temporal selection pattern seems impossible to analytically characterize, which would also change across different learning tasks, models, datasets and algorithms. However, as the general ascending trend leads to considerable performance improvement, it offers valuable guidance for designing client selection schemes across rounds.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works and our empirical study show that in order to accelerate learning, it is desirable for the WFLN to select as as many clients as possible in each round. However, client selection is constrained by finite radio and battery resources. Therefore, the WFLN must judiciously select clients to perform federated learning in each round, without quickly draining clients’ battery and causing insufficient model updates in later communication rounds. To this end, we introduce the following metric to describe the FL performance in round <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">A major challenge of directly solving <span id="S5.SS1.p1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> is that the long-term energy constraint of the clients couples the client selection and bandwidth allocation decisions across different learning rounds: selecting more clients in the current round reduces the bandwidth allocated to each individual client, thereby increasing the energy consumption of these clients; furthermore, more energy consumption in the current round potentially reduces the energy budget available for future FL rounds, and yet the decisions have to be made without foreseeing the future.

To simulate FL, we leverage the TensorFlow Federated (TFF) framework and the MNIST dataset for hand-written digit classification. Each client’s local dataset is keyed by the original writer of the digits. Since each writer has a unique style, this dataset exhibits the kind of non-i.i.d. behavior expected of federated datasets. We use the first 10 clients in the MNIST dataset to conduct our simulation with each client having 100 training data samples. Since the hand-written digit classification is a relatively easy image classification task, we follow TFF’s tutorial to construct a simple three-layer neural network with the first layer being input, the second containing 10 neurons and the third performing the softmax operation.

As the name suggests, Select-All selects all 10 clients in every round, resulting in the ideal optimal client selection for FL. SMO selects much fewer clients due to the hard energy budget allocation in every round. Many clients do not get to upload their local model updates due to the bad channel state that they are experiencing. AMO starts with selecting few clients due to the same reason as SMO. However, as time goes on, energy budget not used in the previous rounds accumulates. This allows the client to transmit at the desired rate using a higher transmission power in later rounds, especially in those towards the very end, thereby countering the effects of bad channel states. As a (fortunate) by-product, AMO also achieves an ascending pattern of client selection. Our proposed algorithm, OCEAN-a, is able to select many more clients than SMO because it uses energy as needed without imposing a hard per-round energy constraint. Compared to AMO, it is able to fine-tune the temporal pattern of client selection by using different sequences of temporal weights <math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\eta" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">η</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜂</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\eta</annotation></semantics></math>.

Because Select-All completely ignores the energy budgets of the clients, it results in a very large energy consumption, far exceeding the energy budgets. On the other hand, SMO does not fully utilize the client’s energy budget because in many learning rounds the client is not selected. Both AMO and OCEAN-a incur a total energy consumption close to the given energy budget (i.e. 0.15) for individual clients.</p>

Select-All, as expected, results in the best FL performance, with the smallest training loss, the highest accuracy and the fastest convergence among all approaches. Due to the insufficient selection of clients in the course of learning, SMO’s learning performance is considerably inferior to all other approaches. Thanks to the fortunate by-product of AMO, AMO’s FL performance is comparable to OCEAN-a in this specific setting, which is close to the ideal case Select-All. However, we will show in the next set of experiments that AMO’s “luck” does not extend to other more complex network environments.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the performance of AMO seems comparable to OCEAN-a in the last experiment, it is achieved in a relatively easy network, where the wireless channel is relatively stable. In this set of experiments, we simulate more challenging network environments where the wireless channel can vary considerably due to, e.g., client mobility. In particular, we simulate two scenarios. In Scenario 1, the average path loss gradually increases from 32 dB to 45 dB, mimicking a scenario where clients move away from the server over time. In Scenario 2, the average path loss gradually decreases from 45 dB to 32 dB, mimicking a scenario where clients move towards the server over time.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Resource allocation in wireless networks is an old topic, but it also faces constantly changing new challenges as new applications emerge. With FL being the trending new wireless network application, the old mindset of resource allocation for traditional applications such as file downloading or video streaming must be changed. This paper identifies a key property of FL, namely the temporal dependency and varying significance of learning rounds, that may significantly reshape how wireless resources should be allocated for optimized network and learning performance, yet is largely overlooked in the literature. While our formulation and algorithm have shown superior performance in real-world FL experiments, there are several future research directions that may extend the impact of this work. For example, we showed that an ascending client selection pattern is generally desired, but it is still not clear what the optimal pattern is. Moreover, client heterogeneity in terms of the computing power and local data size/distribution can be incorporated into the model to further enhance the understanding of resource allocation in more complex WFLNs.</p>
