<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id3.id1">Nowadays, integration of AI-driven tools within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is reshaping the software development lifecycle.
Existing research highlights that users expect these tools to be efficient, context-aware, accurate, user-friendly, customizable, and secure.
However, a major gap remains in understanding developers’ needs and challenges, particularly when interacting with AI systems <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.id1.1">in IDEs</span> and from the perspectives of different user groups.
In this work, we address this gap through structured interviews with 35 developers from three different groups: Adopters, Churners, and Non-Users of AI in IDEs to create a comprehensive Design Space of in-IDE Human-AI Experience.</p>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id4.id2">Our results highlight key areas of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.id2.1">Technology Improvement</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.id2.2">Interaction</span>, and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.id2.3">Alignment</span> in in-IDE AI systems, as well as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.id2.4">Simplifying Skill Building</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.id2.5">Programming Tasks</span>.
Our key findings stress the need for AI systems that are more personalized, proactive, and reliable.
We also emphasize the importance of context-aware and privacy-focused solutions and better integration with existing workflows.
Furthermore, our findings show that while Adopters appreciate advanced features and non-interruptive integration, Churners emphasize the need for improved reliability and privacy.
Non-Users, in contrast, focus on skill development and ethical concerns as barriers to adoption.
Lastly, we provide recommendations for industry practitioners aiming to enhance AI integration within developer workflows.</p>

These AI-powered assistants facilitate tasks like code generation, debugging, and optimization with the goal of boosting productivity and reducing the cognitive load associated with repetitive programming tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">As these tools continue to evolve, there is a growing interest in how developers engage with AI within their daily workflows. However, despite this surge in interest, little is known about the *in-IDE* Human-AI Experience (HAX), particularly the successes and challenges developers face and what their needs are with these tools. We see this gap as a major challenge as IDE is the main tool for software development nowadays — 97% of respondents to the Stack Overflow 2023 survey used at least one IDE for their coding activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">Nonetheless, many studies overlook the in-IDE context and instead focus on general AI usage or overly specific features of AI. Additionally, current research does not address how different developer groups — such as those who have adopted, churned, or never used AI in IDE — experience these tools. However, it is crucial to examine distinct user groups as they reveal different barriers and opportunities for AI adoption. Adopters can highlight advanced use cases and suggest deeper integration into workflows. Churners can offer insights into why they abandoned AI, pointing out specific issues with usability or performance. Non-Users may reveal psychological or practical barriers, such as mistrust or preference for traditional methods, offering guidance for better onboarding and education.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p6.1">In this paper, we aim to address this gap by conducting a series of structured deep interviews with 35 developers who actively use, have churned, or have never used AI inside IDEs. We gathered programmers from 18 countries. The majority of participants were developers (32), many holding multiple roles such as team leads (9), architects (8), and DevOps engineers (5). Experience levels varied, with 16 participants having over 11 years of experience, 10 between 6 and 10 years, and 9 with 5 years or fewer. We explore their experiences, challenges, successes, and needs with in-IDE Human-AI Experience (HAX) in their daily workflows to answer the following Research Questions (RQs):</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p7.1">A semi-structured interview study with 15 data scientists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite> revealed several key preferences for AI code assistants in notebooks. Participants emphasized that code assistants should function as polite ghostwriters and enforce best practices while providing opinionated guidance. Effective assistants should offer multiple ways to control context. Users appreciated when expectations were subverted with useful and surprising results and valued adherence to familiar notebook UI patterns to facilitate adoption. Task-specific assistants tailored for data science were viewed as beneficial, and knowledge of the underlying model was important for shaping user expectations.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p8.1">Overall, these papers highlight the need for AI systems in coding to be efficient, context-aware, accurate, user-friendly, customizable, and secure, while also supporting a wide range of programming languages and sources.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p9">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p9.1">However, most existing studies focus on AI in the broader software development process or on highly specific contexts, making them less generalizable to the in-IDE Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This is a significant gap, as most developers use IDEs for coding.
According to large-scale industrial studies, up to 97% of respondents use an IDE for their developer activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, AI tools integrated into IDEs can have the most immediate and sustained impact on developers’ productivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p10">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p10.1">Therefore, in our work, we focus specifically on in-IDE interactions. We conducted structured deep interviews with three groups of developers — Adopters, Churners, and Non-Users of AI assistants — providing a more nuanced understanding of the in-IDE HAX. The resulting design space, built from these interviews, offers actionable insights for industry practitioners seeking to develop new features and for researchers aiming to align their studies with users’ real-world expectations of in-IDE HAX.</p>

</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p4.1">Several studies found that developers frequently doubt the accuracy of AI-generated outputs, particularly when it comes to more complex or domain-specific tasks. In Zhou et al.’s study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib19" title="">19</a>]</cite> this was identified as a cause for AI tools not being fully adopted. Similarly, our study found that developers are looking for the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p4.1.1">Reliable Technology</span>. They are cautious when using AI tools due to concerns about accuracy and the potential introduction of subtle errors into their codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p5.1">The expectation of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p5.1.1">Internal System Integration</span> within IDEs is another common finding.
Our participants preferred AI assistants that integrate into their existing workflows without causing interruptions. This echoes Sergeyuk et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> and Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite> findings, who noted the significance of workflow integration and non-intrusive tool support. While previous research has primarily focused on standalone AI functionalities, there has been less emphasis on how these tools are integrated and interact within the context of IDEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p6.1">Moreover, the need for user education and learning support identified in our study parallels the concerns raised by Sergeyuk et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> regarding educating users about the capabilities and limitations of AI assistants. Our participants highlighted the importance of effective prompting and acknowledged the learning curve associated with AI tool adoption, suggesting a shared recognition of the challenges developers face when integrating AI into their workflows. Better onboarding and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p6.1.1">User Education</span> are essential to help developers, especially novices, effectively utilize AI.</p>
</div>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p7.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p7.1.1">Proactive Technology</span> is another common topic discussed both in our interviews and previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib20" title="">20</a>]</cite>. Developers from our study feel that AI assistants are too passive, waiting for prompts instead of suggesting improvements based on real-time analysis. They expect AI to take on a more proactive role in analyzing code quality, identifying potential bugs, and suggesting optimizations without explicit prompting. This holistic view of AI as a comprehensive partner in development processes extends beyond the functionalities discussed in prior studies, which primarily focus on code completion and immediate programming assistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p8.1">Developers are cautious about sharing sensitive data with AI models and expect privacy to be prioritized in AI design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.08676v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>. Our participants stressed the need for secure, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p8.1.1">Private technology</span> to build trust in AI tools with many expressing a preference for on-premise or local AI solutions to ensure data protection and compliance with company policies. This finding expands upon the context-aware requirement noted in previous research by adding a layer of data privacy and security considerations specific to in-IDE AI usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p9">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p9.1">Our participants raised ethical concerns related to the environmental impact of AI and the over-integration of AI in development processes.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">This study addresses a critical gap in the understanding of AI usage within IDEs. By conducting structured interviews with a diverse group of developers, we identified key user needs and requests, particularly around Technology Improvement, Interaction, and Alignment in in-IDE AI systems, as well as Simplifying Skill Building and Programming Tasks with these tools. Our proposed Design Space contributes to both academic research and practical applications and offers a foundation for developing more efficient and user-centric AI tools in IDEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p2.1">To address developers’ needs regarding in-IDE AI, we should enhance context awareness and enable project-wide scope and user control. Proactive AI should offer autonomous suggestions and actions, while personalization through customizable setups and transparent outputs fosters trust. Smooth integration with business workflows and external systems and reducing the learning curve are also critical. Finally, ensuring accessibility through flexible pricing and language support will broaden AI adoption and usability.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p3">
