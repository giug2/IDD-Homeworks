<p id="id4.4" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) shines through in the internet of things (IoT) with its ability to realize collaborative learning and improve learning efficiency by sharing client model parameters trained on local data. Although FL has been successfully applied to various domains, including driver monitoring applications (DMAs) on the internet of vehicles (IoV), its usages still face some open issues, such as data and system heterogeneity, large-scale parallelism communication resources, malicious attacks, and data poisoning. This paper proposes a federated transfer-ordered-personalized learning (FedTOP) framework to address the above problems and test on two real-world datasets with and without system heterogeneity. The performance of the three extensions, transfer, ordered, and personalized, is compared by an ablation study and achieves 92.32<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> and 95.96<math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> accuracy on the test clients of two datasets, respectively.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of sensing, computing, and communication technologies, the internet of things (IoT) is a popular solution to solve problems in industry, agriculture, energy, transportation, etc. However, privacy issues in IoT are often a significant concern have been raised due to the intrusive behavior of sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Specifically for the internet of vehicles (IoV), it massively parallels each vehicle and various sensors it carries, including global positioning system (GPS), radar, camera, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), etc., enabling pedestrian detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, automated driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, mobility digital twins <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and other transportation applications. Federated learning (FL) has received extensive attention for protecting user privacy by sharing only model weights and not including users’ raw data. FL is widely known for its successful business case in Google mobile keyboard prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Nowadays, it has also become one of the mainstream and thriving solutions for privacy protection and efficient learning.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a potentially feasible solution to the privacy problem in IoT, which is able to avoid the proliferation, distribution, and exchange of local client data by sharing model parameters after training the model on local client data. FL frameworks are widely used in mobile service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, industrial <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, IoV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, etc., due to their usages of large scale and personalized data in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. Although FL has significant contributions to massively parallel devices and computations, it still has a notable drawback in that it cannot efficiently handle non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data. It is required to customize the applicable FL framework according to the features, resources, and constraints possessed by users, data, clients, and servers.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Non-i.i.d. data and heterogeneity have always been a challenge, and a key to research in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Non-i.i.d. data is a common phenomenon for real-world clients that are scattered and not interoperable: Taking IoV as an example, each driver is heterogeneous as a client. FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, as one of the first proposed feasibility methods, has been the subject and center of research. FedAvg averages all local models to get the global model so that the local model may deviate far from the global optimum in the parameter space leading to some limitations in FedAvg. It is necessary to ensure that the local model does not deviate from the global model (prevent overfitting) and, simultaneously, that the local model can effectively learn the local client dataset (prevent underfitting). Based on FedAvg, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is proposed to limit the deviation of the local model from the global model by adding a proximal term.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Driver monitoring application (DMA) in IoV is adopted as the research direction in this paper due to its real and visual image data, valuable application scenarios, and relatively blank research area. DMA also has challenges in terms of driver privacy issues, communication, and diverse and personalized driver state and behavior. Related DMA literature covers a wide variety of devices with algorithms to achieve different purposes, such as dangerous state detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, driver emotion recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, driver lane change inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, etc. Compared to other methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, FL not only highlights efficient learning but also effectively protects the privacy of driver, passenger, and pedestrian biometric information, driving routes, and confidential driving areas such as military installations.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce and adapt FL to DMA. Although some FL frameworks exist for DMA, they all suffer from some critical problems. Doshi <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposed a FL edge-device framework to obtain a global model by aggregation feature representations and obtained considerable accuracy in recognizing driver activities. For the i.i.d. setting, the dataset was partitioned for each edge node in a random way, while for the non-i.i.d. setting, the dataset was assigned selectively. Zhao <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> proposed a FL framework to monitor fatigue driving, where the non-i.i.d. setting was simulated by controlling the number of images per client. The above FL frameworks for DMA did not really take into account the actual situation of the application but artificially created a simulation scenario. Therefore, there is an urgent need for realistic analysis and research for real-world DMA, considering that the user (driver) should exist independently and be non-interoperable with different clients (vehicles). Moreover, in addition to the necessity of test datasets, the test client is also a critical evaluation criterion, which can reflect the universality of the FL framework. We summarize the existing neglects and challenges in the current FL for DMA frameworks as follows.</p>

Each local client, i.e., vehicle, includes a training module and a perception module. The training module uploads the model parameters to the server after learning and training the local data. After aggregation and optimizing the parameters of the local client models, the server downloads the global model parameters to the perception module in the local client. Moreover, transfer learning can be used to reduce the number of trainable parameters, resulting in reduced communication consumption. The server can save different global models for different scenarios, such as road types, weather types, and vehicle types, so that the model can have better applicability.</p>

Firstly, we can confirm that there is enormous system heterogeneity in IoT, and the global model cannot ensure high accuracy for all clients. Secondly, we inevitably need a measure to prevent system heterogeneity and potential attacks and poisoning. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A Problem Statement ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the farther the optimal local model is from the global model, the lower the accuracy, and vice versa. Therefore, it is conceivable that in the FL problem with heterogeneity, the clients’ accuracy will also obey a Normal distribution.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the problem statement, we propose a FedTOP algorithm to address all of the following issues. First, the aggregation of global models needs to be more stable, which can be achieved by preventing the overfitting of local models. Second, considering the actual communication situation in IoT, we propose a transfer learning method to reduce the trainable parameters and hence reduce communication requirements. Third, the global model should have the ability to resist interference, attacks, and data poisoning, which can be achieved by orderly dropping out local models with a large loss. Fourth, a global model cannot take into account the situation of all clients, especially in the presence of data and system heterogeneity. Therefore, we recommend personalizing the global model to suit all the training and testing clients.</p>

In particular, FL frameworks are favored because they can effectively reduce local client training resources and communication resources. In our experiments, the base model is ResNet34 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> pre-trained on ImageNet, where only the last residual block and fully connected layer are trainable parameters. Although ImageNet is a large object classification dataset far from DMA images, the lower layers are similar to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and are used to extract image features. Therefore, the upper layers that are used to obtain high-level features and representations are given more attention. The ratio of reduced communication resource requirement in the network is approximately equal to the ratio of non-trainable parameters to total parameters,</p>

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A Problem Statement ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the global model cannot be applied to all clients due to the ubiquitous heterogeneity. The region of interest (ROI) of the model may vary depending on system heterogeneity, such as different camera angles, seat positions, and vehicle structures, resulting in differences in the relative position of the driver in the image. However, personalized-extension proposes to train the global model several times in each client to obtain a more personalized local model to improve accuracy. On the one hand, compared with the traditional FL algorithm, the personalized-extension can significantly and effectively improve accuracy and confidence. On the other hand, compared to the method that only trains locally, the personalized FL algorithm improves the training efficiency and avoids the overfitting of the local model. In particular, the personalized FL algorithm can help and generalize to other non-training clients <math id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">C</mi><mo id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐶</ci><ci id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p5.1.m1.1c">C^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math>, which may have minimal training resources.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To compare the impact of system heterogeneity on FL frameworks, the proposed FedTOP is tested on driver monitoring datasets with and without system heterogeneity. The SFDDD dataset includes 26 drivers and 10 activities, and the DriveAct dataset includes 15 drivers and 12 activities. The SFDDD dataset considers system heterogeneity, that is, different drivers have different vehicles, different seat positions, different camera angles, etc., as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F4.sf3" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4c</span></a>, and <a href="#S2.F4.sf4" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4d</span></a>. The DriveAct dataset does not take into account system heterogeneity, i.e., all subjects had their data collected in the same system. Recorded from the same camera angle, different drivers read the same magazine in the same vehicle, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F4.sf5" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4e</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F4.sf6" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4f</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F4.sf7" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4g</span></a>, and <a href="#S2.F4.sf8" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4h</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To show more clearly and visually the heterogeneity between different clients in the two datasets, Fig. <a href="#S2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows histograms of the sample images of the two datasets. It can be seen that the SFDDD dataset with system heterogeneity has a more considerable difference in the distribution of histograms than the DriveAct dataset without system heterogeneity, and the mean value of the SFDDD images is larger. The possible reason is that the vehicle interiors of the DriveAct dataset view are darker, resulting in most of the pixel values being lower. Therefore, FL frameworks may be more challenged by the scene information when training on the SFDDD dataset, such as different vehicle interiors.</p>

By observing the accuracy and loss curves on the two datasets, it can be concluded that the SFDDD dataset with system heterogeneity is fundamentally different from the DriveAct dataset without system heterogeneity. It can be clearly seen that the SFDDD dataset with system heterogeneity requires more communication to converge, while the DriveAct dataset without system heterogeneity has a fast convergence speed, especially at the first communication. Therefore, for real-world datasets, system heterogeneity can be mitigated by more communication times.</p>

Although the anomalous large-loss local model is discarded to reduce the bias of the global model, it also increases the variance of the global model resulting in reduced generalizability.

On the one hand, transfer-extension increases the variance of the model on the SFDDD dataset and leads to a reduced and unstable model convergence. On the other hand, transfer-extension improves the speed of model convergence on DriveAct, and the convergence effect is more stable. The possible reason is that the transfer-extension retains only a small number of trainable parameters, resulting in the neural network model not being able to learn human behavioral features effectively in the SFDDD dataset with system heterogeneity. However, for the DriveAct dataset without system heterogeneity, the factors are constant except for the driver, and the local model does not need to focus on these exact same pixels, but only on the changing pixels, including objects such as drivers, computers, and magazines. Therefore, for the DriveAct dataset, transfer-extension can effectively increase convergence and stability.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Personalized-extension needs to be further discussed and analyzed as the most effective approach to improve accuracy. Based on the division of training and testing clients in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Experiment Setup ‣ III Experiment and Results ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>, in this subsection, we further discuss how the trained and aggregated global model is adapted to both training and testing clients. The results of the personalized-extension on the two datasets are shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ III-B Ablation Study and Results ‣ III Experiment and Results ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> with different personalization epochs, which is equivalent to demonstrating Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. It can be seen that the personalization process differs significantly on the datasets with and without system heterogeneity, which is similar to the results in Fig. <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III-B Ablation Study and Results ‣ III Experiment and Results ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The clients in the DriveAct dataset have faster convergence, minor accuracy variance, and higher final accuracy. On the contrary, the clients in the SFDDD dataset not only converge slower but also have an anomalous client with relatively low accuracy. The possible reason is that the anomalous client has a huge data and system heterogeneity, causing the optimal model to deviate significantly far from the aggregated global model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ III-B Ablation Study and Results ‣ III Experiment and Results ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> further demonstrates that the trained global model repositions the ROI during the personalized training process via class activation map (CAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. The test client of the SFDDD dataset can be seen struggling with the personalization process. The trained global model focuses the ROI on the seat backrest, driver’s chest, hand, and knee, and vehicle door. Due to the system heterogeneity present in the SFDDD dataset, the positions of the driver, seat, and steering wheel, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ III-B Ablation Study and Results ‣ III Experiment and Results ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8a</span></a> is different from other clients, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F4.sf3" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4c</span></a>, and <a href="#S2.F4.sf4" title="In Figure 4 ‣ II-B Proposed Solution ‣ II Methodologies ‣ Federated Transfer-Ordered-Personalized Learning for Driver Monitoring Application" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4d</span></a>. Therefore, the initial ROI is likely to be a driver’s position among other clients. During the five personalization training processes, the local model is able to effectively reposition the ROI to the driver, which is what the personalized-extension is intended to show. Moreover, the personalization process also reduces the number of ROI while targeting more attention to a specific area.</p>

The ROI should cover those pixels that can distinguish between different activities, such as static activities like reading the magazine, and dynamic activities like wearing a seatbelt in the DriveAct dataset activity setting. The ROI focuses on areas where large differences are likely to occur. The fact that the ROI in the DriveAct dataset covers almost the same pixels during the personalization process can also prove the negative impact of system heterogeneity on the FL framework.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed FedTOP is tested on two datasets: SFDDD and DriveAct. Although both datasets involve driver activity classification tasks, they have different objectives. The SFDDD dataset aims to detect driver distraction under normal driving conditions, while the DriveAct dataset is focused on activity recognition in autonomous driving scenarios. The DMA highlighted in this paper is interested in monitoring driver distractions or other risky behaviors, as different activities carry different risk factors. For instance, reaching behind is more hazardous than talking to a passenger. Therefore, in situations where there is a high risk of distracted state or dangerous behavior, the autopilot system can be employed to take control of the vehicle and prevent traffic accidents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The two datasets used, SFDDD and DriveAct, still have some flaws. First, although the SFDDD dataset takes system heterogeneity into account, quite a few drivers collect data in the same vehicle. Therefore, there are still some differences between the dataset and the real-world data, which leads to the fact that the proposed FedTOP may need more communication rounds to achieve similar accuracy on a real-world dataset. Second, there is currently no driver monitoring dataset with real poisoning data currently existing, resulting in the effect of ordered-extension not being reflected. The different modalities, positions, and angles of the camera or the method of generating fake data may be a hypothesis for poisoned data, but it cannot be highlighted as real. Moreover, due to road safety guidelines, the current dataset is only driving on safe roads or simulated driving. Therefore, the driver’s posture, demeanor, facial concentration, etc., are far from the real driving behavior. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more realistic dataset that can include camera images of different positions and angles, different vehicle scenes, and more drivers driving on real roads.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For a FL framework in IoT, in addition to accuracy being the evaluation criterion, factors like communication requirements, robustness, fairness, cybersecurity, etc., also need to be considered. Although it seems that transfer and ordered extensions may not improve accuracy but rather reduce it in the current experimental results, it can potentially improve the performance of the FL framework. Therefore, we keep two extensions as one of our future directions. Personalized-extension is an approach similar to transfer learning and incremental learning. On the one hand, the local client is incrementally learned based on the trained global model, but it does not intentionally retain the previously learned knowledge. On the other hand, the global model is transferred to the client dataset as in transfer-extension, but the low-level non-trainable weights are still pre-trained on ImageNet. Therefore, the proposed personalized-extension actually uses the trained global model weights to fit different client data, such as the reposition of ROI. Although the personalized-extension requires additional training locally for each client, there are many benefits, including high accuracy, applicability to non-training clients, customization, etc. Conceivably, personalized-extension can effectively address the problem of system heterogeneity, e.g., it can be applied to different cameras, camera angles, vehicle interiors, etc.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a FL framework FedTOP for DMA to address the issues of privacy preservation, efficient training, communication resource-saving, poisoned data, and diversified scenarios. Through the ablation study, the impact, role, and performance of three extensions, including transfer, ordered, and personalized on the model, are disclosed. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate dramatic differences between datasets with and without system heterogeneity. In addition to the proposed FedTOP being able to exhibit 92.32<math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> and 95.96<math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> accuracy in two datasets for testing clients, it is also appreciated that FedTOP reduces communication consumption by 37.46<math id="S5.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.3.m3.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> and potentially improves cybersecurity. The experimental results show that the proposed FedTOP is a highly accurate, lightweight, privacy-preserving, robust, cybersecure, and universally applicable FL framework for potential DMAs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Future work lies in the continued research of extensions. For the ordered-extension, a possible plan is to introduce some malicious local clients to attack and poison with the global model. For example, subjects may not place the camera on the side as instructed but place it on the front or behind instead. Such outliers may cause the global model to deviate significantly from the optimal solution, so in this case, ordered-expansion can prevent the deviation of the global model by discarding the larger value of the losses. For the transfer-extension, there is currently a lack of a general driver monitoring model, so we used a model pre-trained on ImageNet. Future work can pre-train a driver model ourselves as a base model, which will get better performance in DMA.
