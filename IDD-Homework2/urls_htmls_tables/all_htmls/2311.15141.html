<p id="id5.4" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) can suffer from a communication bottleneck when deployed in mobile networks, limiting participating clients and deterring FL convergence. The impact of practical air interfaces with discrete modulations on FL has not previously been studied in depth.
This paper proposes a new paradigm of flexible aggregation-based FL (F<sup id="id5.4.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L) over orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) air interface, termed as “OFDMA-F<sup id="id5.4.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L”, allowing selected clients to train local models for various numbers of iterations before uploading the models in each aggregation round. We optimize the selections of clients, subchannels and modulations, adapting to channel conditions and computing powers.
Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the optimality gap of OFDMA-F<sup id="id5.4.3" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L capturing the impact of the selections, and show that the upper bound is minimized by maximizing the weighted sum rate of the clients
per aggregation round.
A Lagrange-dual based method is developed to solve this challenging mixed integer program of weighted sum rate maximization, revealing that a “winner-takes-all” policy provides the almost surely optimal client, subchannel, and modulation selections.
Experiments on multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks show that
OFDMA-F<sup id="id5.4.4" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L with optimal selections can significantly improve the training convergence and accuracy, e.g., by about 18% and 5%, compared to potential alternatives.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a new framework for distributed online computing and model training,
federated learning (FL) has shown significant potential for applications, e.g., Internet-of-Things,
autonomous driving, remote medical care, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
FL enables individual mobile clients to train a global model collectively
without releasing their data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In particular, each client trains its local model independently relying on its local dataset and sends the gradient of the local model to a server.
The server aggregates the gradients and broadcasts the aggregated global parameter to assist the clients in their local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">A challenge faced by FL is the communication bottleneck from the clients to the server,
especially when dynamic, lossy, and resource-constrained channels are considered in wireless FL (WFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The channels of geographically dispersed clients can differ significantly and change over time, leading to different model uploading delays among the clients.
Moreover, the clients can have different computation capabilities, resulting in different local training times,
and consequently, different time budgets for model uploading in an FL aggregation round.
While more participating clients and hence larger overall training datasets are conducive to better training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,
this could lead to a shortage of wireless resources (e.g., bandwidth) for uploading local models.
It is crucial to jointly design the local model training and uploading (transmission) schedule of the clients to balance communication and computation.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The transmission schedule of the clients depends on the model aggregation mechanism adopted.
Typical synchronous FL (Sync-FL) requires all participating clients to upload their local models (or gradients) for a global aggregation after completing their local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Alternatively, asynchronous FL (Async-FL) allows each client to upload its local models straightaway after completing its local training. In the latter case, there can be non-negligible gaps between the time the local models are uploaded and the time the global model is broadcast.
The computing powers of the clients may not be efficiently exploited.
Clients with more powerful computation capability have to wait longer for global model update,
especially when there are “stragglers” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Flexible aggregation-based FL (F<sup id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L) has recently emerged as a promising solution to the issue of “stragglers”, where clients can train different numbers of iterations before sending their local models synchronously
for a global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.2.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The transmission schedule of the clients also depends on their instantaneous computing powers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
A client with a weak computing capability has to transmit at a high data rate
to complete its local model training and uploading within the same period.
Consider a widely-adopted, practical orthogonal-frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA)
as the air interface for WFL.
Effective selections of the clients, channels, and modulations are key to the transmission schedule.
However, the selections form an integer program with discrete variables.
This renders the joint optimization of the communication and computation of OFDMA-based WFL systems
(for example, OFDMA-based F<sup id="S1.p4.2.2.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L, referred to as “OFDMA-F<sup id="S1.p4.2.2.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L” in this paper)
a typically intractable mixed-integer programming problem.</span></p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some existing work has focused on the training accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of WFL
under a persistent policy of client selection and bandwidth allocation (e.g., see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>).
A partial participating scheme of WFL clients was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,
where only some clients were chosen to send their local models for global aggregations to minimize the power and time usage of the learning task.
A partial synchronization parallel approach was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> for a relay-assisted WFL,
where local models were uploaded simultaneously and aggregated at relay nodes to reduce traffic.
The same convergence speed was achieved as the successive synchronization methods.
Yet, none of these studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
optimized communication performances for WFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the communication performance metrics, energy-efficient WFL has been developed to cope with lossy and dynamically varying wireless environments
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
A problem of joint training and communication was constructed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>
to minimize the overall power usage of a WFL system under a training latency requirement.
The optimal resource allocation policy was obtained by using bisection search.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a hierarchical FL architecture was proposed for a heterogeneous cellular system, where the clients were jointly served by macro and micro base stations (BSs).
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was employed to minimize the power usage under a delay constraint
by adjusting client-BS association and resource allocation.
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided FL was examined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>,
where a set of clients formed a NOMA cluster to upload their local models to a BS
for model aggregation.
The total power usage and FL convergence latency were minimized
by jointly optimizing the NOMA transmission, BS broadcast, and FL training accuracy.
Resource-constrained WFL with partial aggregation was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>,
where stochastic geometry tools were employed to approximately calculate the success probability for each device.
All these studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
were based on the Sync-FL framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The Async-FL framework was proposed to handle clients with different communication and computing capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Async-FL was developed, which adapted to the heterogeneity of clients regarding their delays in model training and transmitting.
The fusion weights of the global aggregation were determined to prevent biased convergence
by requiring the weight of each client’s local dataset to be in proportion to its sample number.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, an adaptive Async-FL mechanism was developed, where only a small number of the total local updates were collected by the FL server, depending on their arriving order per round.
To reduce the mission completion time, DRL was applied to specify the number of aggregated local updates under resource constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">An alternative to Async-FL is F<sup id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,
where clients may have trained for different numbers of iterations when uploading their local models.
Different computing powers of the clients can be efficiently leveraged,
although persistent global aggregation cycles are maintained as in Sync-FL.
However, no consideration has been given to the delays resulting from model uploading under flexible aggregation, which would affect the local training time and performance.

where local model gradients were modulated in the analog domain and aggregated by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of radio.
An adaptive device scheduling mechanism was developed for OTA-FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>,

A new model aggregation method was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to align the local model gradients of different devices to resolve the straggler problem in OTA-FL.
Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, a decentralized power control policy was designed to enhance the convergence of
OTA-FL under fading channels, where stochastic optimization was leveraged to decouple the power control among clients.

<span id="S2.SS3.p2.3.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Given the equal duration of each FL round,
if the uplink and downlink delays are longer,
there is a shorter time for local model training.
If the computing delay is longer per iteration, the client can only complete fewer iterations.

Many modern ML models have multiple layers and non-convex loss functions (e.g., CNN).
Nonetheless, a considerable number of ML tasks, e.g., logistic regression, have (strongly) convex loss functions, e.g., cross-entropy, ordinary least, etc.
These convex loss functions satisfy <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Assumption 1</span>.
Many existing algorithms developed under the (strong) convexity assumptions were experimentally validated for ML models with non-convex loss functions,
e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and references therein.</span></p>

This indicates that the selections of clients, channels and modulations are based on their available computing powers. In other words, OFDMA-F<sup id="S5.p4.5.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L is flexible in the number of training iterations accomplished by each selected client by taking the potentially different and even time-varying computational capabilities of the clients into account.
This flexibility enables the algorithm to achieve better efficiency in both communication and computation.</p>

in other words, a higher data rate results in a shorter uplink delay and, in turn, a longer time for local training.
To this end, to maximize the number of local iterations per aggregation round would require the data rate to be maximized.
Moreover, the optimality gap of the FL is minimized by maximizing the number of local iterations per aggregation round; see (17c).
As a result, the minimization of the optimality gap can be transformed to the maximization of the weighted
sum rate, as stated in Problem <span id="S5.SS1.p6.3.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P5</span>.

earlier systems, such as 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and IEEE 802.11ax, may have more rigid constraints for subchannel allocation.
For example, a device can only be assigned with up to two separate clusters of consecutive subchannels
in LTE/LTE-Advanced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
The proposed algorithm can be potentially extended to incorporate this constraint.
For example, when a client is assigned with three clusters of subchannels after <math id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{\lambda}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝝀</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1.1">𝝀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1.m1.1c">\bm{\lambda}</annotation></semantics></math>
is obtained in (32),
we can keep two clusters for the client and redistribute the third cluster to the clients allocated with subchannels adjacent to the cluster or those allocated with fewer than two clusters of subchannels. The performance of this extension will be analyzed in our future work.

The MLP is a feedforward neural network with fully-connected layers.
The MNIST dataset is used to train the MLP with a 32-unit hidden layer.
We employ the softmax with ten classes regarding the ten digits. A cross-entropy loss function is used to capture the error of the model trained on the local dataset.
The accuracy of the model is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions made by the model to the total number of predictions.</p>

Once a certain number of aggregations is reached, the rate of improvement slows down,
and the testing loss converges to the minimum value, as shown in Figs. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B OFDMA-F2L on CNN Model ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ OFDMA-F2L: Federated Learning With Flexible Aggregation Over an OFDMA Air Interface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B OFDMA-F2L on CNN Model ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ OFDMA-F2L: Federated Learning With Flexible Aggregation Over an OFDMA Air Interface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
Similarly, the testing accuracy increases rapidly at first, but levels off.
The model reaches a plateau in its performance in Figs. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B OFDMA-F2L on CNN Model ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ OFDMA-F2L: Federated Learning With Flexible Aggregation Over an OFDMA Air Interface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-B OFDMA-F2L on CNN Model ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ OFDMA-F2L: Federated Learning With Flexible Aggregation Over an OFDMA Air Interface" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</p>

When there are over three modulation modes, the performance of Baseline 1 stays the same since it only considers two modulation modes.
In contrast, the unstable performance of Baseline 2 results from the random client selection policy. These results corroborate the merits of OFDMA-F<sup id="S6.SS3.p3.4.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L with the optimal selections.</p>

A convergence upper bound on OFDMA-F<sup id="S7.p1.4.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L has been derived and minimized by
jointly optimizing the selections of clients, subchannels, and modulations to maximize the weighted sum rate of the clients in each aggregation round of OFDMA-F<sup id="S7.p1.4.3" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L.
A Lagrange-dual based method has been developed to maximize the weighted sum rate, resulting in a “winner-takes-all” strategy delivering almost surely optimal selections of clients, subchannels, and modulations.
As tested experimentally on MLP and CNN,
OFDMA-F<sup id="S7.p1.4.4" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>L with the optimal selections can efficiently reduce communication delay,
