<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technique used to train a machine-learning model collaboratively using the data and computation resource of the mobile devices without exposing privacy-sensitive user data.
Appropriate incentive mechanisms that motivate the data and mobile-device owner to participate in FL is key to building a sustainable platform for FL. However, it is difficult to evaluate the contribution level of the devices/owners to determine appropriate rewards without large computation and communication overhead.
This paper proposes a computation-and communication-efficient method of estimating a participating device’s contribution level. The proposed method enables such estimation during a single FL training process, there by reducing the need for traffic and computation overhead. The performance evaluations using the MNIST dataset show that the proposed method estimates individual participants’ contributions accurately with 46–49% less computation overhead and no communication overhead than a naive estimation method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The expanded use of machine learning (ML) has empowered a wide variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including fine-grained road-traffic and pedestrian prediction, fine-grained environment prediction, anomaly detection in network systems, and fraud detection in financial transactions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Generally, ML requires tremendous computational power to quickly produce the analytical results. The steady growth of cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba) has supported ‘resource-heavy’ ML computing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data used by ML for IoT applications are generated by the IoT devices themselves, which are located at the network edge and include sensor devices, smartphones, and smart vehicles. People engaged in this activity have found this scenario to be problematic for the following two reasons. First, individuals and private organizations are concerned about the privacy of their data when sharing them with an entity that operates an IoT application. After the EU adopted its general data protection regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, privacy became a top-prioritized issue with regard to IoT applications. The second reason concerns bandwidth costs, which individuals or private organizations must bear to support their IoT needs. As the volume of data increases, such bandwidth costs will become more problematic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) was invented to tackle both of the above two issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. With traditional ML, the training dataset is usually stored at a central entity. Data must be first collected from the data sources to facilitate the learning process. FL focuses on data integration methods that comply with privacy and security laws. Under FL, data owners employ privacy protection techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and differential privacy) to contribute model parameters trained on their own datasets to a federation. The federation then combines these local model parameters to train a more effective collective ML model. This allows the learning process to leverage the computational power of the data sources to train the model, similar to crowdsourcing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has shown great advantages in enabling collaborative learning while protecting data privacy, it still faces an open challenge of incentivizing owners of IoT devices to join the FL effort by contributing their computation power and data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. An intuitive idea is to reward participants according to their contributions. However, it is difficult to accurately evaluate their contributions. It has been reported that the relationship between model accuracy and the amount of training data is nonlinear. The model accuracy depends on model complexity and data quality. This accuracy can hardly be predicted in advance.
Generally, in FL, data are unbalanced and non-i.i.d. between clients: as the training data present on the individual clients is collected by the clients themselves based on their local environment and usage pattern, both the size and the distribution of the local data sets will typically vary heavily between different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, accurate estimation of individual contribution levels with small computation and communication overhead is a key to the success of incentivizing participants in FL.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a method that estimates the individual contribution level of FL participants with no overhead traffic and little computation overhead. Conventionally, a direct and accurate way of estimating their individual contribution levels is to first measure the degradation of model accuracy by removing the local model provided by each participant. This method is more computation-and communication-resource consuming, because it must repeat entire FL processes as many times as the number of participants. The proposed method achieves estimation during a single FL process with small computation overhead and no overhead traffic.
This is helpful for the incentive mechanism of FL when quickly determining rewards for each participant on the basis of their contribution levels. Of course, accuracy of the estimation must be also ensured. In this paper, performance evaluation using a real dataset is conducted to validate the proposed method in terms of estimation accuracy.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies on FL incentive mechanisms were published in 2019 and 2020, suggesting that this research topic is building momentum. Several basic analyses have been presented <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Pandey et al. designed a framework in which FL-participating clients iteratively solved the local learning subproblems to meet an accuracy level that was subject to an offered incentive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. A communication-efficient cost model for the participating clients was established to formulate the incentive mechanism and to induce the necessary interaction between the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server and the participating FL clients. Introducing a two-stage Stackelberg game, they analyzed the game’s equilibria and the response behaviors of the participating clients.
Lee et al. designed a distributed learning resource management mechanism over multiple MECs owned by different operators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. They also presented a game theoretic approach that focused on analyzing the market behaviors and the economic benefits of FL by formulating and analytically solving a Stackelberg game model.
Kang et al. adopted contract theory to design an efficient incentive mechanism that mapped contributed resources into appropriate rewards to entice mobile-device owners possessing high-quality data to join FL and overcome information asymmetry issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. They presented the problem formulation and the optimal contract design of their mechanism and showed its superiority using the Stackelberg game model.
Chen et al. modeled and formulated the mechanism-design problem with type-imposed externalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For quasi-monotone externality-setting, they provided a revenue-optimal and truthful mechanism. For the general valuation functions, they provided both necessary and sufficient conditions for all truthful and individually rational mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The method of determining rewards for clients is a key issue for FL incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Kang et al. applied reputation as the necessary metric needed to assess the reliability of an FL-worker candidate, thus ensuring reliable worker selection. High-reputation workers bring high-quality data (i.e., high accuracy and reliability) to model training, generating reliable local model updates for FL tasks.
Liu et al. suggested that, to properly incentivize data owners to contribute their efforts, the Shapley value (SV) was often adopted to fairly assess their contribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. To help FL systems compute SVs to support sustainable incentive schemes, they proposed a blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment system: FedCoin. The SV of each FL client reflected its contribution to the global FL model in a fair way. It was calculated using the Proof-of-Shapley consensus protocol, which replaced the traditional hash-based protocol in existing blockchain proof-of-works method.
Toyoda and Zhang introduced a competitive model-update method so that any rational worker who followed the protocol could maximize their profits. Each worker chosen in a certain round selects the top model updates submitted by workers in the previous round and updates their own model. Here, workers’ reward is decided by the vote of the next round of workers. The motivation of choosing the models that achieve the best k models is that their model updates will have a greater chance to be voted for in the next round, meaning that more rewards will be obtained. This design will naturally compel rational workers to behave honestly without any heavy cryptography or special hardware.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Sustainability and fairness are also key issues of FL incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Yu et al. considered a method to quantify the payoff for each data owner in order to achieve long-term systemic wellbeing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Participants must incur some cost for contributing to the FL model with their local datasets. The training and commercialization of the models take time. Thus, there are delays before the federation has a sufficient budget to pay the participants. They further addressed this temporary mismatch between contributions and rewards.
To address the issues of unshared decisions and ambiguous contribution evaluations, Zhan et al. designed an algorithm based on deep-reinforcement learning (DRL), which can learn system states from historical training records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. DRLs can adjust the strategies of the parameter server and edge nodes according to environmental changes that may impose different requirements on training data.</p>

At each client, the sensor generates data to be used for ML. The receiver receives an ML model from the server and stores it. The learner performs the training process to update the ML model using the data obtained from the sensor. The transmitter uploads the updated ML model to the server. The server ultimately receives the updated ML models from all the clients and stores them. The aggregator performs the model aggregation to update the ML model using the ML models obtained from the clients. The evaluator estimates the individual contribution level of each client by comparing the ML models before and after being updated using the clients’ models. The evaluator sends back the rewards to each client based on its contribution.
Note that decision making by clients is out of the scope of this paper and will be included in future work.
The decision maker at each client makes a decision to participate in FL if the reward is sufficient to compensate the cost of contribution of a client to the FL. Otherwise, a client leaves the FL.</p>

The metric evaluates how much the client’s model improves the global model at each round and regards the sum of the step-wise contributions as the contribution of the FL client. This is based on the intuition that a client that improves model performance at each round will also contribute to the improvement of the final overall model performance.</p>

These metrics are intuitive and easy to calculate. Furthermore, it can be obtained prior to FL training process. However, the metrics do not work in some cases. Supposing that there are three clients having the same number of data with four classes at each client, the client’s data class differs from those of the others. The other clients’ data classes overlap somewhat. In this case, the heuristic metrics become the same value for each client. However, their actual contributions may differ.</p>

Thus, this result indicates the computation load of each method. Since the computation load to calculate heuristic metrics was negligible, which was hundreds microseconds in the experiments, the computation time of the heuristic methods were almost the same as the usual FL. On the other hand, the naive and proposed method increased in the computation time. However, the proposed method increases much shorter time than the naive method, which means that the proposed method requires much smaller computation overhead as discussed in Sect.<a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Design metrics to evaluate client contributions ‣ III Proposed method ‣ Estimation of Individual Device Contributions for Incentivizing Federated Learning This work is supported in part by the US NSF under Grant ACI-1541069, JST PRESTO Grant no.

In the every methods, the contribution scores of Clients 1 and 2 were nearly the same. This is reasonable scoring, because Clients 1 and 2 had the same number and variety of training samples. On one hand, the score of Client 3 was higher than the others according to the naive and proposed methods. This is also reasonable, because the data stored by Client 3 was unique, whereas training data for integers 0–6 were stored at both clients. When Client 3 left the FL, the global model could not achieve an accuracy higher than 0.7. The model could, however, achieve greater than 0.7 if the Clients 1 or 2 left, because both had training data of 0–6 digits. The heuristic methods for Clients 1 and 2 did not consider the data uniqueness and gave the same or lower score to Client 3, which is unreasonable in this scenario.</p>

This is because that the model improvement at each round by a client with small but diverse data samples is little but unstable, which could cause large but temporal model improvement and increase in the step-wise contribution metric employed in the proposed method. This drawback of the proposed method can be mitigated by restricting clients with so small amount of data, which are not expected to improve the global model, from participating the FL.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed an intuitive and computation-and communication-efficient method to estimate the individual contribution levels of participants in FL so as to determine appropriate incentive mechanisms for participation in FL.
The proposed method enabled the evaluation during a single FL training process, there by reducing the need for traffic and computation overhead. The performance evaluations using the MNIST dataset showed that the proposed method estimated the contributions of the individual clients with much smaller computation and communication overhead than those of the naive method.</p>
