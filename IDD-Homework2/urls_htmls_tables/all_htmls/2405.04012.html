<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is seen as a vital component of forthcoming 6G wireless networks, aiming to support emerging applications that demand high service reliability and low latency. However, ensuring the ultra-reliable and low-latency performance of MEC networks poses a significant challenge due to uncertainties associated with wireless links, constraints imposed by communication and computing resources, and the dynamic nature of network traffic. Enabling ultra-reliable and low-latency MEC mandates efficient load balancing jointly with resource allocation. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions, computation and communication resource allocation to minimize the expected weighted sum of delivery latency and energy consumption in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted MEC
network. Given the
formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming
(MINLP), a new multi-agent federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) solution based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) is developed to efficiently
optimize the offloading strategies across the MEC network while accelerating the learning process of the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices. Simulation results show
that the proposed FDRL scheme can effectively reduce the weighted
sum of delivery latency and energy consumption of IoT devices in the MEC network and outperform the baseline approaches.</p>

Moreover, given the constrained computational power and limited battery capacity of IoT devices, meeting predefined task deadlines that require significant resources often becomes unfeasible for these devices. To meet such stringent service requirements, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is an attractive solution to significantly reduce service latency by enabling base stations (BSs) to process computing tasks (e.g., XR rendering) for user equipment (UE), e.g., IoT devices, directly within the radio access network (RAN) without relying on remote cloud servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While promising, ensuring a consistent performance over a MEC network is challenging due to random wireless channel variations, stochastic task arrival, as well as heterogeneity of edge computing servers and computing tasks. Additionally, considering the constrained resources of IoT devices and edge servers, such as limited bandwidth and computing capabilities, the MEC-supported network is susceptible to becoming overwhelmed, resulting in dropped computing tasks and poor QoS. Hence, it is imperative to develop innovative solutions that jointly optimize the offloading decisions and efficiently allocate edge computing resources for processing tasks from IoT devices within the MEC framework.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the majority of existing research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> has tackled the challenge of joint decision-making on offloading, communication, and allocation of computational resources in ultra-reliable and low-latency MEC (URLL MEC) utilizing methodologies from the field of optimization theory. The power allocation for delivery latency reduction in a device-to-device (D2D) enabled MEC scenario is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In fact, the authors propose a new power allocation algorithm to minimize the total latency while guaranteeing the task computing
deadline. However, these algorithms have commonly suffered from issues of scalability, time inefficiency, and high computational overhead. Instead of relying on model-based methods, model-free approaches that leverage machine learning (ML) in combination with the computing capabilities of UEs and BSs can provide new opportunities for enabling URLL MEC.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, the body of work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> presents several new schemes based on deep neural networks (DNNs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the network performance for URLL MEC applications. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose a resource allocation technique using multi-agent DRL in a vehicle-to-vehicle communication network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors present a DRL-based computation and communication resource allocation scheme in a MEC railway IoT network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors develop a joint task, spectrum and
transmit power allocation method based on multi-stack RL to minimize the computational
and transmission latency in a MEC network. However, a significant drawback of many DRL algorithms is their centralization, leading to scalability issues as the number of devices increases. Additionally, finding an optimal policy becomes computationally complex, especially with the exponential growth of the state and action spaces. Moreover, centralized learning demands IoT devices to share their data to train a global model, potentially compromising privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, distributed learning algorithms that enable users to collaboratively build a unified learning model while conducting local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are developed. One of the most promising distributed learning frameworks is federated
learning (FL) which preserves the data privacy by avoiding data uploading to the parameter server (PS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In FL scheme, each device utilizes its individual local dataset for training and subsequently transfers its respective local model to the PS for global aggregation. In particular, FL improves collaboration among agents and enhances the scalability of network resource management algorithms. In this regard, the problem of joint power allocation and
resource allocation for URLL communications in vehicular networks is investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The authors propose a novel distributed scheme
based on FL in order to estimate the tail
distribution of the queue lengths. However, the constraint of energy consumption of each user in the network is not considered.</p>

optimizing resource and learning performance to reduce
communication costs and improve learning performance in

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> focus on optimizing various aspects of FL, including weight compression, convergence analysis and iteration reduction over IoT networks. However, none of the mentioned research works applied FL to enhance the effectiveness in solving a real-world wireless resource allocation problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors employ FL to facilitate the learning process in DRL, wherein individual local DRL models were trained and subsequently merged collaboratively to construct a comprehensive global DRL model.

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework to optimize the reliability of the MEC IoT network by minimizing joint delivery latency and energy consumption of IoT devices using federated DRL (FDRL). In particular, we design a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) model of heterogeneous network
with multiple BSs and multiple IoT devices to dynamically optimize offloading decisions, base station assignment, and channel resource allocation in a decentralized manner across the RAN, while accounting for the constraints of the wireless network and edge computing servers. Given that the proposed problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and difficult to solve, a new algorithm is developed to jointly solve the offloading decision problem, computing resource and transmit power allocation across the MEC network. Mainly, we first reformulate our problem as a multi-agent DRL problem and solve
it using double deep Q-network (DDQN). To enhance both the quality and speed of learning of the proposed algorithm, we integrate FL at the end of each episode. Utilizing FL results in a framework that is both privacy-preserving and scalable, establishing a context for cooperation among agents. Extensive simulation results are carried out to show
the superiority of the proposed algorithm through comparisons with those existing schemes. Results indicate that the proposed scheme considerably
outperforms the benchmarks under multiple performance metrics.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Computing latency refers to the time needed for executing a task at an edge computing server within the MEC network. The execution time of a task depends on the data to be processed and the tasks submitted, therefore, it can be modeled as a random variable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For instance, the execution time for performing the object detection highly depends on the quality or level of details in the captured images, as well as the type (GPU vs. CPU) and processing resources (e.g., processing bandwidth) of the edge server.</p>

architecture in devices. It’s important to note that higher resource utilization, whether in terms of transmit power or computation capacity, reduces the delivery latency at the cost of higher energy consumption. Hence, managing this trade-off requires careful handling through efficient offloading decision-making and precise optimization of both local computation and offloading strategies.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we addressed a joint latency and energy minimization problem for the NOMA-assisted MEC IoT network to guarantee the reliability of the network. Considering the strict QoS requirement for the IoT devices, the problem was formulated by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions, computing recourse allocation and transmit power control. To solve the proposed MINLP, we have developed a new algorithm that adopted FL, DDQN, and optimization theory called FDRL. More specifically, DDQN is used to determine the offloading decisions of the IoT devices. Given the offloading decisions, the computing capacity or transmit power of the devices is optimized to minimize the utility function. Then, we feed
the results into the DDQN framework as the immediate cost function to optimize the offloading decisions. To improve the learning speed of IoT
devices, we use FL at the end of each round.
Simulation
results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to those comparative algorithms.</p>
