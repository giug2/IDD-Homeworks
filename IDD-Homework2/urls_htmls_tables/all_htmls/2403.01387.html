<p id="1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a novel distributed machine learning paradigm that enables participants to collaboratively train a centralized model with privacy preservation by eliminating the requirement of data sharing. In practice, FL often involves multiple participants and requires the third party to aggregate global information to guide the update of the target participant. Therefore, many FL methods do not work well due to the training and test data of each participant may not be sampled from the same feature space and the same underlying distribution. Meanwhile, the differences in their local devices (system heterogeneity), the continuous influx of online data (incremental data), and labeled data scarcity may further influence the performance of these methods. To solve this problem, federated transfer learning (FTL), which integrates transfer learning (TL) into FL, has attracted the attention of numerous researchers. However, since FL enables a continuous share of knowledge among participants with each communication round while not allowing local data to be accessed by other participants, FTL faces many unique challenges that are not present in TL. In this survey, we focus on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on federated transfer learning, and outlining corresponding solutions and applications. Furthermore, the common setting of FTL scenarios, available datasets, and significant related research are summarized in this survey.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, we have witnessed breakthroughs in machine learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), in various fields such as computer vision, smart cities, health care, and recommendation systems, etc. Driven by high-quality training data, these methods have achieved impressive performance and even outperformed humans in certain tasks. With the rapid growth of the mobile Internet, a large amount of data is produced by billions of smart devices. However, these collected data cannot be directly uploaded to cloud servers or data centers for centralized processing due to limitations in data security, user privacy protection, and network bandwidth, which poses substantial challenges to the traditional machine learning approach. Such phenomena is commonly known as “isolated data islands”.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One emerging paradigm for enabling distributed machine learning to solve this problem is federated learning (FL), which was first proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The main idea of FL is to collaboratively train a centralized machine learning model with privacy preservation by transmitting and aggregating model parameters between the distributed participants, which eliminates the requirement of local data sharing and each participant can maintain ownership of their data. However, in certain FL scenarios, the data distribution varies widely between participants. For example, the training data from different participants share the same feature space but may not share the same sample ID space, or the training data from different participants may not even share the same feature space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Therefore, when participants want to utilize global information to improve model utility through FL aggregation, the difference in data distributions, feature space, and label space among participants will influence the model convergence to the optimum<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, due to inconsistent local storage, computational, and communication capabilities among different participant devices, FL may grapple with system heterogeneity challenges, leading to straggler situations or high error rates. In addition to the above-mentioned data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity problems, FL also suffers from model heterogeneity, incremental data, and labeled data scarcity challenges, which are also focal points of attention among many researchers.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges, transfer learning (TL) is employed in FL as an effective method of facilitating knowledge transfer between source and target domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The main concept of TL is to minimize the divergence between the distributions of different domains. Similarly, in one communication round of FL, we could consider each participant as the target domain and the other participants as the source domains. Given that FL often involves multiple participants, i.e., multiple source domains, and requires the central server to aggregate information (e.g., model parameters) from multiple participants to guide the update of the target participant. In the process of continuous interaction among participants, knowledge is mutually transferred, which allows a local model obtained from a specific domain to be used by other participants through TL, thus alleviating limitations such as data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, incremental data, and labeled data scarcity. We rethink FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> from the perspective of TL, and refer to the combination of FL and TL as federated transfer learning (FTL) shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:intro</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, in classical TL strategies, the target domain can directly access the source domain data or model information, which contradicts the principle of FL. Hence, these TL strategies could not be directly applied in the FL. Moreover, the standard FL scheme contains a sending and receiving process through the communication between participant and server to ensure that the global model is updated and optimized across all local participants. So in a communication round, local participants can act as source and target domains at different stages. Concretely, during the sending stage, each participant acts as a source domain to transfer local knowledge to other participants. During the receiving stage, each participant serves as the target domain to receive knowledge from others. These conditions increase the difficulty of applying TL to FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, the above unique challenges of FTL have captured the attention of numerous researchers, and many significant contributions have been made. Existing surveys in the FL field mainly focus on traditional FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, including horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, incentive mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, or introducing FL applications such as healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, mobile edge networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and internet of things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Despite some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> focus on not identically and independently distributed (Non-IID) or other heterogeneous scenarios, such as model heterogeneity, device heterogeneity in FL, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive review on the definition, challenges, and corresponding solutions specific for the application of TL in FL, i.e., FTL.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To fill this gap, this survey is dedicated to giving a comprehensive survey of FTL, including definitions, a categorization, and a discussion of existing challenges and corresponding solutions, common setting scenarios of distribution heterogeneity, available datasets, as well as an outline of current FTL applications and future prospects.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the characteristics of data distribution among connected participants, FL can be categorized into horizontal FL (HFL) and vertical FL (VFL). Generally, HFL considers the distributed participants to have data with the same features but are different in sample space, while VFL considers the distributed participants to have the same samples but different features to jointly train a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Federated transfer learning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> refers that these participants have differences in both feature space and label space. Due to the limited research on federated transfer learning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, this survey categorizes federated transfer learning and VFL as a type of VFL for description.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, depending on whether there is a/some central server(s) responsible for coordinating participants, FL can also be divided into centralized FL (CFL) and decentralized FL (DFL), where CFL assumes that there is a/some server(s) to gather local model-related information or other training information from the participants and then distributes the updated global model back to the participants, while DFL assumes participants directly aggregate information from neighboring participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In the following, we will provide a brief introduction to these FL frameworks and discuss the various settings of source domains, target domains, and tasks when employing transfer learning within these frameworks.</p>

For instance, during the sending stage, participants act as source domains providing model parameters, while the server acts as the target domain, aggregating these parameters to form a global model. Conversely, in the receiving stage, the server serves as the source domain providing global model parameters to each participant.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, as described in subsection 2.2.1, horizontal federated learning assumes that participants have the same feature space, so HOFTL is a form of transfer learning under this HFL assumption. Moreover, HOFTL can also be presented in vertical federated learning when there is partial overlap in the feature space between participants. Unless specifically stated, the HOFTL methods discussed in this survey are all related to HFL. Overall, compared with homogeneous transfer in traditional transfer learning that only considers marginal and conditional probability distributions, HOFTL also considers changes in the total sample size, which corresponds to the Non-IID data setting in federated learning. The detailed challenges of HOFTL are described below, and considering that homogeneous FTL is one of the most frequently discussed, we have summarized the specific settings for each homogenous FTL scenario demonstrated in Table <a href="#S2.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Label concept shift ‣ 2.3.1 Homogeneous federated transfer learning ‣ 2.3 Federated transfer learning ‣ 2 Overview ‣ A Comprehensive Survey of Federated Transfer Learning: Challenges, Methods and Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

In FL, the prior probability distribution inconsistency may occur when different participants have different class distributions in their local datasets. If these differences are not properly handled, they can lead to a federated model that performs unfair and suboptimal performance. For example, an FL system is designed to improve predictions for a specific disease (e.g., diabetes) across different hospitals that participate in model training without sharing private patient records. Hospital A is located in an urban area with a high prevalence of diabetes, possibly due to lifestyle factors prevalent in the population it serves. As a result, in hospital A’s patient data, 30% of patients might have diabetes. On the other hand, hospital B serves a rural area with a different demographic and lifestyle, resulting in only 10% of its patients having diabetes. This difference in the prevalence of diabetes is a classic example of prior probability shift. In some extreme cases, hospital B may even have no positive cases for this disease.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.Px10.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the prior shift, quantity shift refers to the situation where there is a significant imbalance in the number of training samples available among participants. In FL, some participants might have a large dataset, while others may have a relatively small one. This can lead to a situation where the global model is disproportionately influenced by participants with more data, potentially leading to biases or overfitting to the characteristics of those datasets. For example, a large-scale hospital may have thousands of patient records, while a small clinic may only have a few hundred. This difference in data volume is a classic example of quantity shift in FL.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.Px10.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.Px10.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, with uniform feature and label spaces, participants in homogeneous FTL still face data distribution shift problems, including prior shift, covariate shift, feature concept shift, label concept shift, and quantity shift. Most current FTL studies focus on prior and quantity shifts, with few studies tackling covariate shifts. Feature concept shift and label concept shift are even less explored. However, external elements change, like time or policy, may change the relationship between features and labels for partial participants while leaving others unchanged. This intensifies the feature concept drift and label concept drift among participants, which is worth deeper study in the future.

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS4.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Real-world FL applications especially need to use unlabeled data more than others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib195" title="" class="ltx_ref">195</a>, <a href="#bib.bib196" title="" class="ltx_ref">196</a>]</cite>. On the one hand, in cross-device federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, individual devices create a lot of unlabeled data, like photos, texts, and health record data from wearables. It’s unrealistic to label all this data due to its large volume. On the other hand, cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> involves businesses, where data labeling often needs special knowledge. This is common in finance and healthcare sectors. Labeling this data would be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, SSFTL and USFTL have caught the interest of some researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib195" title="" class="ltx_ref">195</a>, <a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>, <a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, data-based strategies emphasize knowledge transfer by modulating and transforming participants’ data for space adaptation, distribution adaptation, and data attribute preservation or adjustment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> without exposing any raw private data. The model-based strategies aim to improve the predictive accuracy of any given participant by the models from other participants in FTL.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Instance augmentation in FTL aims to enhance data homogeneity of various participants through techniques like oversampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib197" title="" class="ltx_ref">197</a>, <a href="#bib.bib198" title="" class="ltx_ref">198</a>, <a href="#bib.bib199" title="" class="ltx_ref">199</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and undersampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib200" title="" class="ltx_ref">200</a>, <a href="#bib.bib201" title="" class="ltx_ref">201</a>, <a href="#bib.bib202" title="" class="ltx_ref">202</a>]</cite>, which mainly occurs on the side of the participants. In detail, FedHome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, Astraea <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and FEDMIX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> consider resolving prior probability bias at the local participant level. However, they ignore the effectiveness of global information in the local augmentation process. Therefore, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite> suggest bridging the gap between participant and global distribution by creating a public dataset, but this also increases the risk of privacy leakage. To mitigate this issue, Faug <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, an FTL approach based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), is proposed to avoid privacy issues from multiple data transfers. Faug trains a GAN on minority class data at a central location, then sends it back to participants for data generation, helping build independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets. However, the construction of the generator increases extra computational and communication costs. the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> introduces a batch normalization (BN) based data augmentation approach, involving the following steps:</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Instance selection aims to select a subset of the available data that is most representative or informative for the training process. In distributed learning, numerous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib203" title="" class="ltx_ref">203</a>, <a href="#bib.bib204" title="" class="ltx_ref">204</a>, <a href="#bib.bib205" title="" class="ltx_ref">205</a>, <a href="#bib.bib206" title="" class="ltx_ref">206</a>, <a href="#bib.bib207" title="" class="ltx_ref">207</a>, <a href="#bib.bib208" title="" class="ltx_ref">208</a>, <a href="#bib.bib209" title="" class="ltx_ref">209</a>]</cite> suggest that constructing local training samples that are closer to the target distribution through instance selection methods can effectively enhance model performance. However, these methods are designed for traditional distributed training where training data is public. They are not suitable for FL, which uses private datasets from different owners. To solve this problem, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> suggests using a benchmark model that is trained on a targeted small dataset before FL starts to evaluate the relevance of each participant’s data, where only highly relevant data is used for local training. However, this method does not consider the influence of other participants on the benchmark model during FL training. Accordingly, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib210" title="" class="ltx_ref">210</a>]</cite> finds that calculating the sample loss during FL training can reflect the sample’s homogeneity with the global data distribution. Among these, local samples with stronger homogeneity are more conducive to improving the global model’s utility. As a result, this study proposes an FL framework named FedBalancer, which employs a selection strategy based on sample loss to filter local samples, aiming to build a local training set that is better aligned with the global sample distribution. However, FedBalancer increases computational costs because it requires calculating the loss value for every individual local sample. the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> introduces a less computationally expensive method for selecting samples. This method uses the gradient upper bound norms of samples to assess their importance to global model performance. It calculates gradients from the loss of the last layer’s pre-activation output, rather than calculating the gradient from the overall model parameters. This usually requires just one forward pass to accurately estimate a sample’s importance. Specifically, the proposed algorithm includes the following two steps:</p>

In the past, most clustering methods in FTL used model-related information for clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib170" title="" class="ltx_ref">170</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib211" title="" class="ltx_ref">211</a>]</cite>. This model-related information includes things like model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, gradient information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, training loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib170" title="" class="ltx_ref">170</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib211" title="" class="ltx_ref">211</a>]</cite>, and other external info <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. Except for these, clustering methods based on data-related information also can be applied to mitigate the prior shift issue. For example, Astraea <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> traverses all unassigned participant data distributions by a greedy strategy, looking for a group of participants that can make the overall data distribution of each cluster as close to a uniform distribution as possible.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For example, Fed-FiS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib176" title="" class="ltx_ref">176</a>]</cite> generates local feature subsets on each participant by estimating the mutual information between features and between features and categories. Then, the server ranks each feature and uses classification tasks to obtain a global subset of features. Similarly, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> utilizes a federated feature selection algorithm based on MI in the operation of autonomous vehicles (AV). This algorithm completes global iterative feature selection by locally executing an aggregation function based on Bayes’ theory, which greatly reduces the computational cost. Moreover,
Feature selection is a common idea to extract important features, which can obtain similar performance across different domains, and these important features can serve as a connection for knowledge transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In HOFTL, the local dataset of different participants may have similarities in feature space, and high dimensional features can delay the training time, leading to more energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. In this case, removing irrelevant features and selecting useful overlapping features is crucial to address the distribution shift problem in FTL. Current FL researches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib176" title="" class="ltx_ref">176</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> have proposed a variety of solutions to the above problems, which mainly include three steps:</p>

Therefore, in FL, participants can also transfer knowledge at the parameter level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> by parameter sharing, which avoids the privacy risks brought by direct transmission of local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. For instance, the source and target models share parameters, and the target models use their local data to fine-tune the final layers of the source model, thereby creating a new model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>. Since parameter sharing is a common approach in FL and often forms the basis for other methods, this section will focus on explaining the basic method of locally fine-tuning the global model.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite> finds that fine-tuning global model parameters with local training sets significantly improves prediction accuracy, particularly for local models that differ greatly from global predictions. Unlike FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, which fine-tunes the global model’s top parameters using local data, Per-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> averages all participant model parameters and fine-tunes all global model parameters using the MAML meta-learning method. However, the majority of existing FL frameworks based on parameter sharing mainly focus on improving the global model’s performance on each participant using the participants’ local data, overlooking the enhancement of a global model’s generalization performance from the server’s perspective. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite> proposes an FL framework based on a fine-tuning and head model aggregation method, called FedFTHA, which includes FedFT and FedHA. From the participant’s perspective, FedFT focuses on improving the performance of the global model to the participant’s local dataset by retaining and fine-tuning the local head model. From the server’s perspective, FedHA works to reconstruct a global model that exhibits generalized performance, leveraging the participants’ head model developed during FedFT. This approach enables both participants and the server engaged in FL to mutually benefit and realize a situation where all parties are advantaged.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px7.p1.5" class="ltx_p">The knowledge learned from participants is kept as model parameters and is transferred by the server in CFL. Using the global model directly as the local model usually requires a strong correlation between the global and local data distributions. If there are large differences in data distribution among participants, using the global model directly and optimizing it with local data could lead to a significant decrease in the model’s generalization ability. To address this, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib216" title="" class="ltx_ref">216</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> in FTL restrict the similarity between the source and target models by parameter restriction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For example, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib216" title="" class="ltx_ref">216</a>]</cite> controls the differences between local and global model parameters by a proximal term, which aims to avoid the global model being significantly skewed by too many local updates and further affecting robust convergence. This approach keeps updates close to the initial model, helping to tackle the problem of prior distribution shift and covariate shift issues. However, this proximal term could not align local and global optimal points, and considering the potential loss of important parameter information when the global model is transferred locally. FedCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite> introduces elastic weight consolidation (EWC) from continual learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib217" title="" class="ltx_ref">217</a>]</cite>. By using a server-side proxy dataset to estimate the importance of global model weights, local updates can be adjusted to prevent significant changes in vital parameters during local adaptive training:</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib218" title="" class="ltx_ref">218</a>]</cite> indicates that the classifier of the model may exhibit significant accuracy decreasing when dealing with imbalanced prior probabilities. Therefore, many studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib218" title="" class="ltx_ref">218</a>, <a href="#bib.bib219" title="" class="ltx_ref">219</a>, <a href="#bib.bib220" title="" class="ltx_ref">220</a>, <a href="#bib.bib221" title="" class="ltx_ref">221</a>]</cite> have suggested that sending partial local models for aggregation by decomposing models of participants into body (extractor) and head (classifier) parameters can improve accuracy in the target domain, which is called parameter decoupling. The body parameters can capture general data information and be maintained locally, enabling each participant to learn data characteristics for specific tasks, while head parameters learn specific features of the target domain for sharing with the server to improve the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. For instance, FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>, FedBABU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite>, FedAlt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite>, FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and SPATL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> perform global aggregation by sharing a homogeneous feature extractor. LG-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, CHFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>]</cite>, and FedClassAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>]</cite> share a homogeneous classifier. Different from these, Fed-ROD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>]</cite> shows great effectiveness by splitting the model head into general and personalized layers. Two predictors are trained using a shared body model to handle the competing objectives of generic and personalized federated learning. One predictor employs empirical risk minimization (ERM) for personalization, while the other uses balanced risk minimization (BRM) for general learning. Moreover, FedU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite> proposes a local sharing protocol based on a Siamese network. By aggregating only the online models from the source Siamese network to update the target model, it effectively enables knowledge transfer between participants. However, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> finds that existing parameter decoupling methods by updating the entire model during the training process, lead to a decrease in personalization performance. Therefore, it proposed an FL framework, called FedBABU. It updates only the body part of the model parameters during the federated training process, and the head is fine-tuned for personalization during the evaluation process. To more accurately determine the degree of impact each layer of the model has on the target domain, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite> introduces a layered sharpness-aware Minimization (LWSAM) algorithm, which addresses the problem of poor participant performance due to the biased generic information shared by all participants. This method first calculates the distance between the global and local models at each layer, determining how much each layer is affected by the target domain. It accurately divides the model into head and body parts. Then it uses the sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm as a local optimizer. By adding more disturbances to the model body, the method adjusts the influence of the target distribution on the model from a global perspective.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to varying data distributions among participants, directly applying an aggregated global model to a target domain often does not give optimal results. One popular solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> is parameter pruning, which selects a subset of model parameters from the source domain to apply to the target domain. For example, FedMask <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite> uses a method called ’model binary masks’ to selectively activate certain model parameters for training. This can happen after just one step of communication, without needing to fine-tune the model on local data, which reduces redundancy in communication and computation. In study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>, each participant uses a pre-trained reinforcement learning agent to choose parameters for combining data in a federated manner. They then use a global encoder and a local predictor to transfer knowledge from the combined model to individual models. Another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite> proposes a federated search method, which uses a lightweight search controller to find an accurate local sub-network for each participant. This method is good at extracting useful information and lowers the energy used for analysis and training. HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite> proposes splitting the global model along its width while maintaining the full depth of the participants’ DNN models, which aims to find more suitable local models. However, this approach could construct very thin and deep subnetworks, leading to a significant loss of basic features. To overcome this issue, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>]</cite> introduces a federated learning framework, named ScaleFL, which uses early exits to adaptively reduce DNN models’ width and depth, finding models best suited for training with limited local resources.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Model weighting</h5>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px10.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px10.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The knowledge transfer between participants can be accomplished by sharing local model-related information, such as model parameters, which involves aggregating them before local training, called model aggregation. However, different participants may have distinct optimal goals, simply averaging their model information with the same weight could result in the combined results not being the best solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The global model in the server may also be overly influenced by a single participant’s model, causing ’model drift’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib222" title="" class="ltx_ref">222</a>, <a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>]</cite>. Thus, model weighting is applied to aggregate models according to their contributions. This prevents model performance degradation caused by directly averaging information from different actors into a domain. For example, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> finds local data with higher prediction errors has more contributions to improve the overall model performance, and then introduces an FL framework, called FedCav. FedCav measures the quality of local data using their prediction errors to decide the weights in the model aggregation process. Considering that the server doesn’t know the local data distribution, FedFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib223" title="" class="ltx_ref">223</a>]</cite> uses a global representation of multiple virtual components with different parameters and weights to portray the data distribution of different participants. The server uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the best parameters and weights of the distribution components based on limited statistical information taken from the original model parameters. Additionally, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite> treats the blending of multiple models in FL as a graph-matching task, and then proposes an algorithm, called GAMF. It views channels and weights as nodes and edges of a graph, respectively. Then it uses a new hierarchical algorithm to increase the similarity of weights between channels, and proposes a cycle-consistent multi-graph matching method to merge various local source models in FL, enhancing the global model’s generalization. Experiments show that GAMF can be used as a plug-in to boost the performance of existing FL systems.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px11.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In reality, participants’ local data may significantly differ from the optimal global distribution, and each participant’s data characteristics can not be directly controlled, thus it is important to select participants related to the data or specific target labels for training, called model selection.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px11.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px11.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For example, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite> proposes a DFL algorithm based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). In the DAG, each participant selects the model updates of other participants based on their data similarity, which has been demonstrated effectively in both prior and covariate shift scenarios. Astraea <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, a scheduler-based multi-participant rescheduling framework, re-schedules multiple participants through a scheduler, which follows that the data distribution of multiple participants is most similar to a uniform distribution. Dubhe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>]</cite> is an FL algorithm based on repeated model selection, which allows the server to repeatedly select local models to participate in aggregation, and then send the encrypted distribution of the selected participants to the server to check the similarity between the global data distribution after aggregation and the consistency distribution. This process continuously adjusts the aggregation strategy and improves classification accuracy. Another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> proposes a Shapley value-based federated averaging algorithm. It calculates the Shapley value of each participant to assess its relevance to the server’s learning objective, estimating the participant’s contribution in the next communication round of FL. This allows the server to select local models with higher contributions for training in each round of aggregation. In addition, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> require each participant to collect models from all other participants and use an additional local validation set to evaluate the similarity between participants. In contrast, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite> utilizes mathematical analysis methods instead of using empirical search from validation data sets to characterize the similarity between participants. Apart from data distribution, another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> considers differences in local data volumes between participants. Note that uniform sampling could overlook participants with more data, reducing their contributions to the global model training and impacting the model’s performance. To address this, the researchers propose FedSampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, a framework that uses a data uniform sampling strategy. When the participants’ data distributions are highly imbalanced, participants randomly select others based on the ratio of the server’s desired sample volume to the total available participant sample volume, further improving FL model performance.</p>

To further enhance model adaptability in the target domain by utilizing the sub-model clustering method, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>]</cite> designs a scale-based aggregation strategy, which scales parameters according to the pruning rate of the sub-models and aggregates overlapping parameters. It further introduces a server-assisted model adjustment mechanism to promote beneficial collaboration between device source models and suppress detrimental collaboration. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the sub-model structure of server devices based on a global view of device data distribution similarity. In addition, studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> use exogenous information like the types of local devices participants use or patient drug features (drugs given within the initial 48 hours of ICU admission, comprising 1399 binary drug features) for clustering. However, these methods tend to overlook the ’cluster skew’ issue caused by grouping, leading to the global model overfitting to a specific cluster’s data distribution. “Cluster skew” refers not only to an imbalance in the category distribution among groups after clustering but also to an imbalance in the number of participants in each cluster. To address this issue, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite> suggests a new FL aggregation method with deep reinforcement learning, called FedDRL, which can tap into the self-learning capability of the reinforcement learning agent, rather than setting explicit rules. Specifically, FedDRL utilizes a unique two-stage training process designed to augment the training data and reduce the training time of the deep reinforcement learning model. Moreover, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite> proposes a DFL framework based on hierarchical aggregation, named Spread. In this framework, the server acts as the FL coordinator, and edge devices are grouped into different clusters. Selected edge devices, as cluster leaders, responsible for model aggregation tasks. Spread monitors training quality and manages model aggregation congestion by adjusting both intra-cluster and inter-cluster aggregations.</p>

Additionally, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib168" title="" class="ltx_ref">168</a>]</cite> introduces a new FL framework, called FPL, which is based on prototype clustering. FPL uses the mean features of local data as prototypes, and clusters these prototypes at the server using a comparison learning method. This process brings similar prototypes closer and pushes different ones further apart. Moreover, to increase the stability of model training, FPL uses consistency regularization to minimize the distance between the representative prototypes and their unbiased counterparts. Compared to transferring model parameters in the FPL, the size of the prototypes is much smaller than that of the model parameters, which significantly reduces communication costs.</p>

In this way, the knowledge maintained in the model(s) of the participants (source model) can be transferred to the model of another participant (target model) during the training process.

For example, FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib152" title="" class="ltx_ref">152</a>]</cite> keeps participant-specific batch normalization layers to normalize local data distribution.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px3.p1.7" class="ltx_p">Except for the classification loss term, a consistency loss term can be introduced based on a cluster-aware mechanism, which uses the differences in both intermediate outputs and predictions between the global and local models to guide local model optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib154" title="" class="ltx_ref">154</a>]</cite>. It further groups the participants into clusters based on the feature clustering method by harnessing the similarity among lower-level features of each participant’s model. Each cluster has its own global feature vector and average prediction value. By minimizing the L2 norm between each participant and the global feature and prediction value within its cluster, the method improves the robustness of local models under the covariate shift issue of homogeneous FTL. Additionally, PFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib168" title="" class="ltx_ref">168</a>]</cite> introduces a consistency regularization term based on a global unbiased prototype. It suggests that the cluster prototype averaged by the server, as an unbiased prototype, can provide a relatively fair and stable optimization point. Calculating the square difference loss between the local feature vector and the unbiased prototype can address the issue of unstable prototype convergence. The regularizer in PFL can be expressed as:</p>

For example, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">157</a>]</cite> proposes a more flexible way of decoupling, designing an FL algorithm based on structured pruning, called Hermes. In this method, participants determine the sub-networks to participate in server aggregation through model pruning. To prevent information loss that could result from directly averaging local models, Hermes only averages overlapping sub-network parameters on the server, keeping the parameters of the remaining non-overlapping parts unchanged. The aggregated parts of the sub-networks are then sent back to the local devices for network updates, thereby improving the model’s performance on local tasks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedUReID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">158</a>]</cite> enhances the adaptability of the aggregated global model to each participant’s local model by applying an exponential moving average (EMA) to update the global model for each participant, where the weight of the EMA represents the similarity between the global and local models. Additionally, FedDG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib159" title="" class="ltx_ref">159</a>]</cite> takes advantage of the domain flatness constraint, which serves as a substitute for the complex domain divergence constraint, to approximate the optimal aggregate weights. Moreover, FedDG uses a momentum mechanism to dynamically assign a weight to each isolated domain by tracking the domain generalization gap, improving its generalization capability. Past studies often simplify the blending of source models into a straightforward allocation problem, ignoring complex interactions between channels. Meanwhile, since model weights are shuffled during training, before merging, channels of each layer need to be aligned to maximize similarities in weights between multiple source models. This presents a quadratic assignment property problem, which is NP-hard problem. To tackle this problem, GAMF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite> propose to treat the channels and weights as nodes and edges of a graph to obtain the weights information. These weighting methods typically rely on model parameters or gradient differences to measure each participant’s contribution to the target prediction. However, the transmission of this information involves potential privacy leakage risks. Thus, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib228" title="" class="ltx_ref">228</a>]</cite> views the local model of each participant as black-box model, in which all data is stored locally and only the source model’s input and output interfaces are accessible. Each participant’s soft outputs are given a weight based on their inter-class variance. These weighted outputs are then used to create target pseudo-labels. Therefore, it proposes a federated adaptive learning framework called Co-MDA, called CO-MDA. CO-MDA changes the label noise learning section into a semi-supervised learning approach and proposes a Co2-Learning strategy. This strategy involves training two networks at the same time that filter each other’s errors through epoch-level co-teaching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib229" title="" class="ltx_ref">229</a>]</cite>, and gradually co-guess the pseudo-labels with the outputs of both target networks to further reduce the impact of label noise.</p>

However, these methods require several communication rounds to separate all inconsistent participants, potentially affecting computational and communication efficiency. Therefore, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib169" title="" class="ltx_ref">169</a>]</cite> proposes a method FedMA to achieve hierarchical clustering of participants with a single round of communication. This method uses the difference between the initial global model parameters and local model parameters to generate multiple sub-clusters. Then, by calculating the pairwise distances between participants within all sub-clusters, similar sub-clusters are iteratively merged until only a single cluster remains, containing all samples. Furthermore, similar to study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> in addressing prior shift issue, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> treats the multi-center participant clustering issue as an optimization problem, which can be effectively resolved using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, different from traditional federated clustering methods, which associate each participant’s data distribution with only one cluster distribution (known as hard clustering), the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib160" title="" class="ltx_ref">160</a>]</cite> introduces a soft-clustering-based FL paradigm, called FedSoft. FedSoft allows each local dataset to follow a mixture of multiple cluster distributions, improving the training of high-quality local and cluster models.</p>

For example, CMFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> compares the local update of each participant with the global update during each iteration of learning by calculating the proportion of parameters in the local update that have opposite signs to those in the global update, which aims to assess the degree of alignment between the two sets of gradients. A higher proportion indicates a greater deviation from the direction of joint convergence, rendering the local update less relevant. CMFL thus selectively excludes such divergent local updates from being uploaded, effectively minimizing communication costs in FL while ensuring convergence can still be significantly achieved.</p>

Different from traditional methods, IFCA does not require centralized clustering algorithms. The server only plays a role in average model parameters, which substantially decreases the server’s computational load.

Feddg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>]</cite> uses the amplitude spectrum in the frequency domain as data distribution information and exchanges it among participants. The goal is that each participant can fully utilize multi-source data distribution information to learn parameters with higher generalization, which proves equally effective under covariate shift. In addition, considering that Bayesian optimization is a powerful surrogate-assisted algorithm for solving label concept shift issues in FL and black-box optimization problems where the local model-related information is not visible to other participants for privacy. Some researchers have turned their attention to federated Bayesian optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>, <a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>, <a href="#bib.bib231" title="" class="ltx_ref">231</a>, <a href="#bib.bib230" title="" class="ltx_ref">230</a>]</cite>. However, these methods either have all participants work together on the same task, or make only one participant learn from others to tackle a specific task. However, in real life, the tasks of participants are often related to each other. the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib230" title="" class="ltx_ref">230</a>]</cite> introduces an efficient federated multi-task Bayesian optimization framework, called FMTBO, which dynamically aggregates multi-task models based on a dissimilarity matrix derived from predictive rankings. Additionally, FMTBO designs a federated ensemble acquisition function that effectively searches for the best solution by using predictions from both global and local hyperparameters, enhancing the generalization of the global model. Besides, pFEDVEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite> introduces an FL framework based on Bayesian models and latent variables, and combines the model weighting strategy to mitigate label concept shift issues. In this setup, a hidden shared model identifies common patterns among local models, meanwhile, local models adapt to their specific environments using the information from the shared model, which determines the confidence levels of each participant. The confidence levels are then used to set the weights when combining local models. The extensive experiments have demonstrated that pFEDVEM robustly addresses three types of distribution shift issues including prior shift, covariate shift, and label concept shift, and obtains significant accuracy improvement compared to the baselines.</p>

Additionally, the numbers of samples for participants in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib172" title="" class="ltx_ref">172</a>]</cite> are only assumed to be small or large, Different from it, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib162" title="" class="ltx_ref">162</a>]</cite> not only more focuses on overall social well-being, but also is suitable for any number of participants with any various numbers of samples.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.17" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneous feature spaces often occur in VFL, thus, we mainly focus on the VFL scenario for feature space heterogeneous FTL. To address this issue, researchers can utilize methods such as feature alignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>, <a href="#bib.bib232" title="" class="ltx_ref">232</a>, <a href="#bib.bib233" title="" class="ltx_ref">233</a>]</cite> or feature concatenation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib177" title="" class="ltx_ref">177</a>]</cite> to construct new feature datasets for model training. Among them, feature alignment in VFL can be completed by constructing a novel feature subspace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib232" title="" class="ltx_ref">232</a>]</cite>, or filling in missing or incomplete features of each participant’s feature spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>]</cite>. These approaches enable knowledge transfer under a homogeneous feature space. Specifically, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>]</cite> assumes an inconsistency in the feature spaces between two participants, the active participant <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.17.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_italic">A</span> and the passive participant <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.17.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_italic">B</span>.

Based on this, the federated aggregation can be implemented under the aligned feature space. However, these methods rely on the existing feature space of participants, ignoring the relationships among these features. By combining feature clustering methods, the active participant can create new, more valuable feature space for knowledge transfer.
For example, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib174" title="" class="ltx_ref">174</a>]</cite> proposes a VFL paradigm based on feature space decomposition clustering, called PrADA. The specific steps include:</p>

Directly applying them in FTL to solve feature space heterogeneous issues produces significant computational and communication overhead, as each training round involves multiple encryptions, decryption operations, and intermediate parameter transfers. For example, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib180" title="" class="ltx_ref">180</a>]</cite> suggests using an embedded method to combine autoencoders with L2 constraints on feature weights for feature selection, and sets a threshold for post-training to determine the selected features for mitigating the problem of model parameter shrinkage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib235" title="" class="ltx_ref">235</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">System heterogeneity among participants could lead to the emergence of stragglers in each iteration. To address this problem, instance selection can be leveraged by researchers to mitigate the computational burden of participants when they have heterogeneous local computational resources. However, it could lead to decreased model performance due to the reduced statistical utility of the training dataset. Study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib236" title="" class="ltx_ref">236</a>]</cite> obtains the optimal data selection scheme through an optimization function that includes lower and upper limits of resources, as well as arbitrary, non-decreasing cost functions per resource, meanwhile, it treats this problem as a scheduling problem of tasks assignment to resources, seeking to maximize the number of participants in each round of FL updates. In addition, FedBalancer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib210" title="" class="ltx_ref">210</a>]</cite> chooses samples for training by measuring their statistical utility, derived from the sample loss list based on the latest model. However, it is inefficient to wait for every participant to finish local training before proceeding with aggregation due to system heterogeneity. Thus, under a constant FL round deadline setting, instance selection could not immediately enhance the time-to-accuracy ratio.</p>

For example, Fedavg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> directly drops models of these stragglers which can not accomplish local training in time when the other participants have completed the same amount of training. Based on this, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib216" title="" class="ltx_ref">216</a>]</cite> allows varying local training epochs across participants, tailored to each device’s system capabilities. Subsequently, it aggregates the non-convergent updates submitted by stragglers, rather than dropping these less responsive participants from this iteration. However, these frameworks may come at the cost of sacrificing accuracy due to the omission of partial information and waiting for all participants to complete a uniform number of training epochs tends to extend the convergence time of FL. FedAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite> blends synchronous and asynchronous updates by decoupling the model parameters at the layer level, which stratifies local models based on the time each participant needs to complete a round of training. During each training round, FedAT randomly selects some local models in each layer to calculate the loss gradient of local data, completing the synchronous update of models in that specific layer. Each layer, acting as a new training entity, then asynchronously updates the global model. The faster layers have shorter round-response delays, speeding up the convergence of the global model. The slower layers contribute to global training by asynchronously sending model updates to the server, which further improves the predictive performance of the model. Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>, <a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>]</cite> selectively use local models for transfer knowledge by parameter pruning methods under the limited computational resources. Study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib146" title="" class="ltx_ref">146</a>]</cite> introduces a FL framework, called FedHiSyn, which uses a resource-based hierarchical clustering approach. This framework first categorizes all available devices according to their computing capabilities. Given that a ring topology is more suitable for models with uniform resources, after local training, the models are sent to the server. Then, within their respective categories, they exchange local model weight updates based on the ring topology structure to mitigate the lag effect caused by system heterogeneity. Considering that the main challenge of dynamic heterogeneous FTL is the appropriate scheduling of participants, essentially a local model selection issue at each iteration. Some researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>, <a href="#bib.bib138" title="" class="ltx_ref">138</a>, <a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>, <a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> assume the central party has 1-lookahead in source model selection strategies, which means that the dynamic input data beforehand is known. However, this can not be applied when dealing with unpredictable time series inputs. Thus, reinforcement learning has been increasingly used to design source model selection strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>, <a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>, <a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>. Studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>, <a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite> propose FL paradigms based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB). In situations where the available computing resources of participants are unknown, these approaches calculate the difference between the data distribution of multiple combined participants and a class-balanced data distribution, and then pick local models for aggregation and assign weights based on these differences. In another study, Study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> proposes a participant scheduling strategy by age of update (AoU) measurement. This strategy considers the age of the received parameters and the current channel quality at the same time, which improves efficiency and allows effective aggregation in federated joint learning.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Except for the above-mentioned reinforcement learning methods in dynamic heterogeneous FTL, TiFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>, a hierarchical federated learning framework, addresses system heterogeneity issues by grouping participants with similar training performance. Meanwhile, in each round of updates, TiFL adaptively selects local models for training within each group by simultaneously optimizing accuracy and training time. To accelerate model convergence under system heterogeneity, FedSAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite> suggests choosing participants with larger local training losses to take part in aggregation during each training round. FedSAE also designs a mechanism to predict each participant’s maximum tolerable workload, aiming to dynamically adjust their local training rounds. Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib237" title="" class="ltx_ref">237</a>]</cite> found that differences in bit-width among participant devices can impact the performance of the global model. Low-bit-width models are more compatible with hardware but could limit the model’s generalization, leading to poor performance of high-bit-width models. To tackle this, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib237" title="" class="ltx_ref">237</a>]</cite> introduces ProWD, a FL framework that considers bit-width heterogeneity. This framework selects sparse sub-weights compatible with full-precision model weights from the low-bit-width models received by the server. These selected sub-weights then participate in central aggregation along with the full-precision model weights. Another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite> proposes a FL framework, called Aergia, which freezes the most computation-heavy parts of the model and trains the unfrozen parts. Moreover, the server chooses a more reasonable offloading solution based on the training speed reported by each participant and the similarity between their datasets. In this way, the training of the frozen parts can be offloaded to participants with ample resources or faster training speeds. PyramidFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib148" title="" class="ltx_ref">148</a>]</cite> is a fine-grained participant selection, which considers not only the distribution and system heterogeneity between the selected and non-selected participants but also within the selected participants themselves. Specifically, the server uses feedback from past training rounds to rank participants based on their importance, participants then use their rank to determine the number of iterations for data efficiency and the parameters to drop for system efficiency. Furthermore, the utility of each participant isn’t static but varies across training rounds. If a participant is selected, its data utility will then decrease since these data have been seen by the model. Thus, reducing the likelihood of selection in subsequent training rounds allows participants who were not selected previously to have a higher probability of being chosen, which further improves the model performance under the dynamic heterogeneity and further enhances the fairness of participant selection.</p>

To mitigate this issue, each participant selectively utilizes only the knowledge of the relevant tasks that have been trained on other participants during each iteration, while ignoring as much as possible the knowledge of irrelevant tasks that may interfere with local learning. Thus, parameter decomposition and model weighting methods have attracted the attention of researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>]</cite>. For example, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>]</cite> solves this problem by decomposing parameters into three different types for training: global parameters that capture the global and generic knowledge across all participants, local base parameters that capture generic knowledge for each participant, and task-adaptive parameters for each specific task per participant. Meanwhile, FedWeIT applies sparse masks to select parameters relevant to a given task, minimizing interference from irrelevant tasks of other participants and allocating attention to the server’s aggregated parameters to selectively filter parameter information. However, all these methods lack a theoretical basis for ensuring convergence. FedL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> uses dynamic adaptation to measure the extent to which online decision constraints are breached and calculates a maximum limit for this measure, which guarantees that the expected contribution of the chosen source model to the FL model’s performance matches its actual contribution.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.7" class="ltx_p">Model adaptive FTL is often caused by model heterogeneity, i.e., the local models of different participants may be inconsistent in architecture, which could cause incompatibility in the feature dimension and representational capacity among participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>. It means that the average aggregation approach based on consistent features can not be used directly in FL. To mitigate this issue, data-based strategies are proposed in FTL. For example, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib238" title="" class="ltx_ref">238</a>]</cite> proposes to apply a feature mapping method to obtain consistent representation space and complete FL. Considering that even with different model structures, they possess some common knowledge for the same input, i.e., the feature extraction layers generate similar feature maps, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib238" title="" class="ltx_ref">238</a>]</cite> uses “model drafts” to align local data distributions of participants. These outputs from specific layers or models are interpreted as blurred images of data and defined as model drafts. By minimizing the similarity difference between the local and global drafts, the data distribution difference between participants can be reduced. Except for feature mapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite> using explicit features, some implicit features can be utilized to align the source and target domains, facilitating knowledge transfer within this aligned space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, called feature alignment. Implicit features include subspace attributes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib239" title="" class="ltx_ref">239</a>]</cite>, spectral characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>]</cite>, prototype graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. For example, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> uses prototypes to effectively transfer information under the model adaptive FTL by minimizing local and global prototype graphs within the same feature space, thereby capturing the semantic information of class structures. It avoids the possibility of data from different classes (across various participants) merging into a single class, or data from the same class being spread across multiple classes. Similarly, FedHeNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>]</cite> is a FL framework based on instance-level representation. Each participant randomly selects part of local data and obtains instance-level representation to guide local training. By introducing a distance function based on centralized kernel alignment as a proximal term of the local loss function, it aligns local and global model representations, enabling federated learning across heterogeneous models. FedFoA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib239" title="" class="ltx_ref">239</a>]</cite> adds a linear calibration layer at the end of each local model to first calibrate the different feature dimensions among participants to the same dimension space.

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Inconsistent model architectures also make the simple average aggregation of model parameters ineffective. From the model-based perspective, studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">157</a>]</cite> implement FedAvg on top of local sub-networks by parameter decoupling. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite> assumes that the model architectures of participants can dynamically change with each iteration, and further proposes to leverage parameter decoupling to obtain at least one fixed sub-network for each type of heterogeneous situation and aggregate them into a single global model. Thus, smaller local models can gain more from global aggregation by performing less global aggregation on a subset of the parameters from larger local models. Similarly, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>]</cite> combines parameter decoupling with model clustering method to group local models based on the similarity of their personalized sub-networks, maximizing the level of knowledge sharing between participants. Besides, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite> designed a Mapper at the local level to convert feature representations from different semantic spaces to the same feature space, and accomplish the knowledge transfer based on knowledge distillation (KD). They deploy a global generator at the server to extract global data distribution information and distill it into the local model of each participant. Then, local models are viewed as discriminators to reduce the difference between global and local data distributions in heterogeneous feature spaces. Since the feature representations synthesized by the global generator are usually more faithful and homogeneous to the global data distribution, they can achieve faster and better convergence. Additionally, local generators also can be used to enhance hard-to-judge sample data, improving model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite>. In real-world scenarios, cross-institutional FL is often more content with the VFL scenario. However, traditional VFL can only benefit from samples shared among multiple parties, which severely limits its application. Therefore, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite> proposes a VFL framework based on representation distillation, called VFedTrans. This framework collaboratively models common features among multiple parties and extracts federated representations of shared samples, aiming to maximize data utility as much as possible through KD.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge distillation is also often used for dealing with model adaptive FTL induced by model heterogeneity as shown in Table <a href="#S3.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 3.5 Semi-supervised and unsupervised FTL ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ A Comprehensive Survey of Federated Transfer Learning: Challenges, Methods and Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib164" title="" class="ltx_ref">164</a>]</cite> uses KD for federated learning in situations where different models are used. Instead of just combining model parameters, FedMD calculates class scores for each participant using a shared dataset. These scores are then sent to a server to calculate an average, which guides the training of local models. This method allows for knowledge sharing while keeping private data and model structures secure, and it works even when different local models are used. Contrary to the assumption that participants’ local models are entirely different, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite> assumes that local models of participants are not fully heterogeneous, and there are cases where some models share the same structure. Therefore, they propose an FL framework based on ensemble distillation, called FedDF. It creates several prototype models, which represent participants with identical model structures. In each round, FedAvg is performed among participants with the same prototype model to initialize a global model (student model), followed by cross-architecture learning through knowledge distillation. In this process, the parameters of the local model (teacher model) are tested on an unlabeled public dataset to generate predictions for training each student model on the server. Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite> adopts a federated communication strategy, denoted as FSFL, which is similar to FedMD, innovatively adding a latent embedding adaptive module to alleviate the impact of domain discrepancies between public and private datasets.

Therefore, research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> proposes an FL framework based on zero-shot knowledge distillation, called FedZKT. FedZKT requires no prerequisites for local data, and its distillation tasks are assigned to the server to reduce the local workload. In addition, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib143" title="" class="ltx_ref">143</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib166" title="" class="ltx_ref">166</a>, <a href="#bib.bib144" title="" class="ltx_ref">144</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>, <a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite> introduce generators to avoid the need for public datasets, enabling the aggregation of local information in a data-free manner. For example, FedFTG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib144" title="" class="ltx_ref">144</a>]</cite> uses the log-odds of each local model as a teacher to train a global generator and fine-tunes the global model using pseudo-data generated by the global generator. Due to the additional computational and communication costs imposed by the introduction of a generator, ScaleFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib135" title="" class="ltx_ref">135</a>]</cite> proposes a self-distillation method based on exit predictions. This method treats self-distillation as an integral part of the local training process, requiring no extra overhead. ScaleFL enhances the knowledge flow among local sub-networks by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between early exits (students) and final predictions (teachers). Furthermore, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib167" title="" class="ltx_ref">167</a>]</cite> introduces a FL framework based on a data-free semantic collaborative distillation, called MCKD. This framework transfers soft predictions from local models to a server to learn representations that don’t change across different domains. MCKD also introduces a knowledge filter to mitigate the potential amplification of irrelevant or malicious participants’ influences on the target domain by traditional averaging aggregation. This knowledge filter generates consensus knowledge for unlabeled data and sets a threshold to drop models where local model predicted classes are inconsistent with consensus classes, further adapting the central model to target data. However, most of these methods construct ensemble knowledge by merely averaging the soft predictions of multiple local models, overlooking that local models have a differential understanding of distillation samples. Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib139" title="" class="ltx_ref">139</a>]</cite> suggests that a model is more likely to make the correct predictions when the samples are included in the domain used for the model’s training. Based on this, the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib139" title="" class="ltx_ref">139</a>]</cite> proposes treating each participant’s local data as a specific domain and designs a domain-aware federated distillation method named DaFKD. DaFKD can recognize the importance of each model to the distillation samples. For a given distillation sample, if the local model has a significant relevance factor with it, DaFKD assigns a higher weight to this local model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The labeled data scarcity is a common scenario in both HFL and VFL scenarios. Data-based methods receive some attention in reality for SSFTL issues, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>, <a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> utilize these methods to obtain valuable augmented data by strategically optimizing predictions or similarity calculations on these data. For example, SemiFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite> uses both past local and global models to predict labels for local unlabeled data. When predictions have high confidence, the pseudo-labeled data is used to train as available data. Orchestra <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> uses a feature clustering method to obtain more available data for training. It refines local data clusters through interactions with the server, which helps find effective samples in unlabeled data, further increases sample size, and reduces distribution heterogeneity when labeled data is scarce. Different from them without considering the high-class imbalance of unlabeled data, based on the instance selection method, CBAFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite> uses the empirical distribution of all training data from the last round of global communication to design category-balanced adaptive thresholds. That is, if the model uses more data for training in one class, the threshold for labeling unlabeled data in this class will increase, and vice versa. It aims to shrink the gap between local and global distributions by selecting a local training set, and further influence category distribution, preventing a decline in global model performance due to prior probability bias.</p>

Furthermore, researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite> also apply domain-dependent consistency regularization to solve this issue. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> uses the KL divergence between local and global model predictions to control the update of the local objective function. Additionally, other model-based strategies, such as parameter decoupling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, model weighting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib153" title="" class="ltx_ref">153</a>, <a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>, <a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite>, also attract some researchers’ attention. FedMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> accomplishes the FTL under semi-supervised learning scenarios by training labeled and unlabeled data separately through model parameter decomposition. FedConsist <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib153" title="" class="ltx_ref">153</a>]</cite> and RscFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> improve the performance of models in semi-supervised FTL by changing the weights of participants with labeled and unlabeled data. Since semi-supervised learning often deals with data that only has positive and unlabeled (PU) samples, one participant’s negative class could be made up of multiple positive classes from other participants. However, traditional PU learning mostly focuses on binary problems with only one kind of negative sample. Thus, study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite> assumes that the available data has multiple types of positive and negative classes (MPMM-PU), and further proposes to redefine the expected risk of MPMM-PU, which aims to decide each participant’s weight and examines the limits of the model’s generalization.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In response to unsupervised FTL, a straightforward approach is to combine self-supervised methods with FL, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib195" title="" class="ltx_ref">195</a>, <a href="#bib.bib241" title="" class="ltx_ref">241</a>]</cite>. However, this challenge is often accompanied by homogeneous or heterogeneous FTL issues. The feature-based strategies have obtained some attention to solve this problem, such as FedCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib242" title="" class="ltx_ref">242</a>]</cite> based on feature selection, FSHFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> based on feature mapping, and FedFoA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib239" title="" class="ltx_ref">239</a>]</cite> based on feature augmentation. Moreover, studies also propose to alleviate the data drift issues between participants by model-based strategies, such as FedX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib147" title="" class="ltx_ref">147</a>]</cite> based on KD, and FedEMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> based on model interpolation. FedCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib242" title="" class="ltx_ref">242</a>]</cite> shares features of local data and employs an auxiliary pubic dataset to minimize disparities in the representation space across participants. However, it ignores the inconsistency between the feature representation of local unlabeled data and global feature representation. To solve this problem, FSHFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, an FL framework based on an unsupervised federated feature selection approach, proposes the feature cleaning locally and global feature selection. The local feature cleaning utilizes an enhanced version of the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) algorithm, called FAR-OCSVM, to identify features that lack sufficiently representative global features. The identification relies on local feature clustering, features within each cluster exhibit strong interrelationships, thus the clusters with more features contribute more significantly to the FTL process. Meanwhile, the server selects global features from the collected local feature sets and then returns these global features to participants, directing them to select local features that are closest to the global representation. Considering that the public dataset has potential privacy leakage risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib242" title="" class="ltx_ref">242</a>]</cite>, FedX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib147" title="" class="ltx_ref">147</a>]</cite> incorporates local knowledge distillation and global knowledge distillation into the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> without any public data. Local knowledge distillation trains the network using the feature representations of local unlabeled datasets, and global knowledge distillation aims to mitigate data shift, which only relies on global model sharing. Besides, FedEMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> utilizes self-supervised learning methods with predictors, including MoCo and BYOL, to update local encoders through the EMA of the global encoder.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to reduce data sparsity by transferring knowledge from a data-rich source domain to a target domain. However, this process presents significant challenges related to data privacy and knowledge transferability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib243" title="" class="ltx_ref">243</a>, <a href="#bib.bib244" title="" class="ltx_ref">244</a>]</cite>. Therefore, federated learning is introduced to CDR to improve the performance of the target domain model while providing privacy protection. Currently, classic recommendation algorithms have been widely applied to federated learning, such as federated collaborative filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib245" title="" class="ltx_ref">245</a>, <a href="#bib.bib246" title="" class="ltx_ref">246</a>]</cite>, federated matrix factorization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib247" title="" class="ltx_ref">247</a>, <a href="#bib.bib248" title="" class="ltx_ref">248</a>, <a href="#bib.bib249" title="" class="ltx_ref">249</a>]</cite>, and federated graph neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib250" title="" class="ltx_ref">250</a>]</cite>. However, these methods neglect the heterogeneity among them including data, resource, or model heterogeneity. Researchers have combined transfer learning techniques to accomplish tasks related to federated cross-domain recommendation.

However, their predictive models all rely on large amounts of data to achieve training.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This survey provides a systematic summary of federated transfer learning, which emerges from the combination of transfer learning with federated learning, offering the corresponding definitions, challenges, and strategies. For convenience for researchers, we compile settings for the most common data heterogeneity scenarios, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous federated transfers, and summarize some significant FTL studies for various challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, the utility performance of FL models in more complex scenarios deserves further exploration, including label concept shift, feature concept shift, label space heterogeneity, and feature &amp; label space heterogeneity. Due to differences or mutations in unknown or hidden relationships between input and output variables between participants, the concept shift becomes an important but less studied direction in FL. Meanwhile, label space heterogeneity and feature &amp; label space heterogeneity also deserve more in-depth study.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, although federated transfer learning uses model selection, weight aggregation and other transfer learning methods to solve the problems of data heterogeneity, dynamic heterogeneity and labeled data scarcity in FL, new privacy concerns may have also emerged about these strategy preferences. After participants crack the weighting strategy or selection mechanism used by the server to aggregate information from all parties, they may use unfair means to make the training of the global model develop in a direction more beneficial to themselves. Thus, possible leakage of strategy preferences should be properly considered when designing FTL strategies in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the communication costs, communication efficiency, and computational costs caused by these FTL strategies could be paid more attention by FL researchers. Compared with traditional FL methods, FTL strategies, such as instance augmentation, instance selection, feature selection, model selection, and model clustering, etc., increase additional computational costs and introduce more shared information among participants. It may lead to higher communication costs and affecting communication efficiency. In summary, FTL still has great potential research value in utility, privacy, and communication issues.</p>
