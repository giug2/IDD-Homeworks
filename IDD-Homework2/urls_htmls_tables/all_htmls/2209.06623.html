<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, federated learning (FL) over wireless networks is investigated. In each communication round, a subset of devices is selected to participate in the aggregation with limited time and energy. In order to minimize the convergence time, global loss and latency are jointly considered in a Stackelberg game based framework. Specifically, age of information (AoI) based device selection is considered at leader-level as a global loss minimization problem, while sub-channel assignment, computational resource allocation, and power allocation are considered at follower-level as a latency minimization problem. By dividing the follower-level problem into two sub-problems, the best response of the follower is obtained by a monotonic optimization based resource allocation algorithm and a matching based sub-channel assignment algorithm. By deriving the upper bound of convergence rate, the leader-level problem is reformulated, and then a list based device selection algorithm is proposed to achieve Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results indicate that the proposed device selection scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of the global loss, and the developed algorithms can significantly decrease the time consumption of computation and communication.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of mobile devices and applications, the amount of data is exploded in the fifth-generation (5G) era, which leads to the great progress in machine learning (ML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In conventional centralized ML, a central server is equipped at the access point (AP) to collect all raw data for model training. However, due to the limited wireless resources and potential privacy issues, centralized ML is impractical for some scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a distributed ML algorithm to train neural networks while keeping the data locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in FL, a global model is shared among multiple devices, and each device trains the received global model based on the local data and produces a local model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. After that, all local models are transmitted to the server via wireless communication networks to generate the updated global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since the raw data does not leave the device, and the size of the model is much smaller than the data, privacy-sensitive issues can be avoided and less communication resources are consumed.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the characteristics of FL, the related design and optimization in existing wireless communication architectures have attracted much attention. The convergence time, which is jointly determined by the number of communication rounds and the time consumption per round, is regarded as an important metric for evaluating the performance of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By confirming the relationship between global loss and convergence bound, some works focused on the global loss minimization problem in order to increase the convergence rate, or reduce the number of required communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the authors have designed a FL algorithm with multiple local training. The impact of local and global update rounds on the convergence bound was analyzed, and the approximate solution of the global loss minimization problem was obtained. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the packet error rate was introduced to indicate whether the parameter transmission was successful or not, and then user selection, resource block allocation, and power allocation were jointly studied under delay and energy constraints. FL was also considered in a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenario with energy harvesting, where user scheduling and power allocation were included in the global loss minimization problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Moreover, this work was extended to a multi-cell system, and user association between users and base stations (BSs) was considered. The model pruning scheme was adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, where the unimportant weights can be set to zero in order to reduce the model size. In this paper, device selection, time slot allocation and pruning ratio were jointly optimized to maximize the convergence rate with a latency constraint. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a global loss minimization problem was formulated with the total time consumption limitation, and then decoupled into a device scheduling problem and a bandwidth allocation problem. By analyzing the convergence bound of FL, the trade-off between the latency of each round and the number of required rounds was revealed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As another factor in determining the convergence time, latency of FL, including computation time and communication time, was extensively researched in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a realistic wireless network was designed for FL, where a limited number of users can be selected at each round for aggregation. By obtaining user selection and resource block allocation schemes, the convergence time of FL was minimized. By setting a local accuracy level at each device, the FL algorithm with multiple local update rounds was proposed in a cell-free massive MIMO scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in the formulated training time minimization problem, time consumption for downlink transmission, uplink transmission, and computation were comprehensively considered. A multi-task FL framework was studied in a multiaccess edge computing (MEC) scenario, where edge nodes were included to accomplish different learning tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In order to minimize the latency of each communication round, the optimal matching between edge nodes and end devices was obtained. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> have proposed a hybrid learning scheme which combined edge computing and FL. Particularly, part of data can be offloaded from devices to the server for training, and then the local models can be trained based on the remaining data. It was demonstrated that the proposed scheme has the ability to reduce the total time consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As forwarded mentioned, global loss minimization and latency minimization were extensively researched in existing works. However, most works have studied it individually. As pointed out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, there exists a trade-off between global loss and latency. That is, some devices with the great positive impact on global loss may have poor channel conditions or weak computational capacities, and hence, the latency of this communication round will be obviously increased. Normally, the latency can be reduced by increasing transmit power or central processing unit (CPU) frequency, which means consuming more energy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Hence, there exists another trade-off in FL, i.e., the interaction between latency and energy consumption. Even though global loss and latency were jointly studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, it is necessary to consider the practical energy budget in a latency minimization problem and the possible impact on the global loss. In this paper, based on Stackelberg game, the interaction between global loss minimization and latency minimization are investigated with limited energy and time. It is revealed that the negative effects caused by energy and time constraints can be reduced by optimizing the CPU frequency and transmit power. On the other hand, due to the fact that the number of devices participating in FL is usually much larger than the number of available sub-channels, device selection is commonly considered in the FL based wireless communication framework. The conventional device selection scheme depends on either wireless resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> or local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In this paper, a novel age of information (AoI) based device selection scheme is proposed, which can improve the convergence rate without analyzing local models.

Therefore, the server tends to select the devices with lager age of gradient update for aggregation. In particular, if a device has been skipped for several rounds, its gradient update is relatively informative, and the probability of the server selecting the device should increase. Conversely, if a device was selected in the previous round, the probability for its reselection should decrease.

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a Stackelberg game, the leader can predict the strategy of the follower, and then propose its strategy first. For the follower, it can observe the strategy of the leader and provide its response. Specifically, in the formulated Stackelberg game based problem, the leader selects devices for minimizing global loss, and then the follower assigns sub-channels to the selected devices and adjusts computational resource allocation coefficients and transmit power for minimizing latency. By predicting the best response of the follower, the leader can obtain the feasibility of the selected devices in the considered system, and provide the corresponding optimal device selection strategy. This solution follows Stackelberg equilibrium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, as shown below.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.8" class="ltx_p">Due to the fact that problem (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV-A Joint Optimization of Power Allocation and Computational Resource Allocation ‣ IV Solution of Follower-Level Problem ‣ Age of Information in Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) is still non-convex, the traditional optimization methods, such as convex optimization, cannot be directly employed. Therefore, monotonic optimization is introduced to solve this problem. In order to utilize monotonic optimization, the monotonicity of problem (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV-A Joint Optimization of Power Allocation and Computational Resource Allocation ‣ IV Solution of Follower-Level Problem ‣ Age of Information in Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) should be analyzed.

The AoI based DS is able to outperform random DS, especially in convergence rate. In the fixed DS, the size of dataset is obviously smaller than other schemes, which leads to the worst performance. By comparing matching based SA and random SA, it can be found the proposed matching based algorithm can improve the performance of FL. This is because the matching based SA can significantly increase the number of selected devices in each communication round, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Age of Information in Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigated FL in a practical wireless communication scenario with limited sub-channels and resources. For minimizing the global loss, the AoI based device selection scheme was proposed to select devices in each communication round, and computational resource allocation, power allocation, and sub-channel assignment were jointly considered to minimize the latency of each round. The monotonicity of the resource allocation problem was analyzed, and then a monotonic optimization based algorithm was developed to find the optimal solution. With the given solution of resource allocation, a matching based algorithm was proposed to solve the sub-channel assignment problem. For the global loss function minimization problem, the upper bound of convergence rate was derived, and AoI was included as part of the weight. By ordering devices according to their priorities, a device selection algorithm was proposed. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is able to achieve the near optimal solution, and can significantly improve the test accuracy and latency.</p>
