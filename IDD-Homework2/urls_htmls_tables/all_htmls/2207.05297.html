<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a Machine Learning (ML) technique that aims to reduce the threats to user data privacy. Training is done using the raw data on the users’ device, called clients, and only the training results, called gradients, are sent to the server to be aggregated and generate an updated model. However, we cannot assume that the server can be trusted with private information, such as metadata related to the owner or source of the data. So, hiding the client information from the server helps reduce privacy-related attacks. Therefore, the privacy of the client’s identity, along with the privacy of the client’s data, is necessary to make such attacks more difficult. This paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving protocol for FL based on group signature. A new group signature for federated learning, called GSFL, is designed to not only protect the privacy of the client’s data and identity but also significantly reduce the computation and communication costs considering the iterative process of federated learning. We show that GSFL outperforms existing approaches in terms of computation, communication, and signaling costs. Also, we show that the proposed protocol can handle various security attacks in the federated learning environment. Moreover, we provide security proof of our protocol using a formal security verification tool.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method ensuring that raw data is not distributed to other devices. The motivation behind FL is to secure users’ sensitive information. For example, uploading real-time images increases the risk of revealing personal information to the server or eavesdroppers. The data breach has become a serious threat that even if organizations spend a massive budget on securing their data, they are still getting attacked. In 2020, the investment to secure companies’ data grew to 53 billion. However, 30 billion records were compromised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">chris, </a>]</cite>. It shows how serious and important it has become to secure our data. It is often illegal to share data from one place to another, even from one country to another. Therefore, FL will be essential in sharing machine learning models without compromising privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The clients in a FL network participate in updating the system model by sending their local model updates to a central system, say a server. Then, the server can finalize the global model to be deployed. During this process, the clients do not send their raw data. They send only locally trained gradients. Next, the server collects gradients from all the clients and aggregates those to generate an updated global model. Still, there are many scenarios at various stages of the FL process where network entities, including the server, are compromised, requiring additional measures to preserve privacy even if the data is not being sent in raw form, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1. Introduction ‣ Efficient and Privacy Preserving Group Signature for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The communication process mainly involves the participating clients and the server. If any of the entities in the network is compromised, the secrecy of this technique is at stake. In that case, the compromised entity can attempt to infer the sensitive information or the source of information from the received gradients based on the sender, revealing the sender identity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">hu, </a>]</cite> and increasing the risk of inference attacks. Hence, it is crucial to secure the privacy of the sender and the information even if only the updated gradient is being shared. Moreover, since FL is a decentralized network, entities of the network can be active or passive attackers themselves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">aslam, </a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Bonawitz, </a>]</cite> proposed a double masking scheme in which messages are shared with servers after double masking it. Each user shares double sets of secret keys with every participant. After adding their share of secret keys to the message, all participants send messages to the server. Every secret key gets canceled out when a certain number of secret keys are combined. Hence, actual data is hidden, and the method effectively protects privacy. However, the computation cost is exponentially high because the secret keys must be distributed to each client for each message.
In 2020, Li, Yong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">yong, </a>]</cite> proposed a single masking FL framework based on the chained secure multiparty computing (SMC) technique (chain-PPFL). They used a chained-communication mechanism to transfer the masked information between participants with a serial chain frame. Their experimental result shows they can achieve competent accuracy and convergence rate while providing privacy preservation for FL. However, their costs are higher than many existing techniques.
In 2021, Ang Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">Ang, </a>]</cite> addressed the issue of heterogeneous data in separate clients and the bandwidth limitation of a mobile device. They proposed the FedMask FL framework, where only heterogeneous binary masks are communicated between the server and the end devices. The clients do not learn the global model. Still, they learn from a personalized and structured sparse DNN model composed by applying the learned binary mask to the fixed parameters (frozen parameters) of the local model. However, the model has high complexity.</p>

Their protocol is based upon on-device machine learning, and there is no centralized data for training. This model focuses on exchanging global models with their associated minor, and they receive awards based on the trained samples transmitted. However, storage and speed limitations are major bottlenecks with on-device training.
Recently, in 2022, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">Zhu, </a>]</cite> proposed a double-masked blockchain-based FL technique, in which they claimed to provide better privacy with lower communication costs between blockchain and end-users. However, it has high computation costs for computing double masks. Also, the problem of sharing secrets with other participants and user dropouts remains.
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">yijing, </a>]</cite> presented a FL-based privacy preservation technique in autonomous driving where the original data is stored in local vehicles, and only updated information is shared with the server. Based on blockchain, drivers are authenticated with zero-knowledge proof. They used homomorphic encryption in their traceable identity-based approach because the server cannot be trusted completely.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The cost of communication is relatively high. Each client needs to communicate with other clients in the network to share the secret keys, making the complexity in polynomial time, which is highly inefficient. Also, the client needs to trust another client with their secret keys, which is risky because nodes in a decentralized wireless system cannot be trusted. The situation worsens when the server and a client (or few clients) conspire together to extract information about a particular client (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1. Introduction ‣ Efficient and Privacy Preserving Group Signature for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). If the server can acquire a particular number of secret keys from the compromised clients, it can reveal the actual data sent by a client. Moreover, the list of clients participating in the FL process is disclosed publicly so that clients may know the participating clients to share their secret keys. However, the list is a piece of additional information for the attacker, who may target a particular client from the list.</p>

<div id="S1.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are motivated to implement privacy in FL using a less complex, more efficient, and secure technology to solve the abovementioned issues. Hence, we propose a privacy-preserving Group Signature scheme for FL (GSFL). A group signature (GS) verifies a group instead of a particular client. There can be multiple groups, and each group consists of an admin. The admin is assumed to be a trusted entity in the network, assigning the keys to each group member to generate the signature. No one other than the admin knows the signer. Since the server cannot infer the particular identity from the received information, the risk of inference attacks is reduced because there is no linking between the clients and their gradients. GSFL has several advantages over the existing privacy-preserving techniques for FL, as explained below.</p>

Therefore, it can be used in combination with different FL models. However, the original GS contains several verification parameters, increasing the packet’s size. The distributed learning process in FL incurs a high communication cost from multiple iterations involving thousands of clients. Hence, communication efficiency is one of the critical performance metrics. Therefore, we aim to provide a new group signature algorithm that is efficient for the iterative process of FL.</p>

End devices (clients) process their data locally, and instead of the raw data, they send only updates to the centralized system (server). After this, data from all the clients would be aggregated at the server to create an updated global model, and this model is again sent back to clients.

Moreover, it is complex to perform computation on encrypted data, and the source may need to reveal part of their secret key, a significant threat in a wireless scenario.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">We aim to improve the traditional group signature process considering the iterative process of FL. Traditionally, the group signature sends all the binding and tracing parameters in its signature so it can be recovered at the receiver side. It requires certain variables at the receiver side to verify that it is a valid group signature. Compared to the baseline protocol presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">sneha, </a>]</cite>, the proposed protocol improves the efficiency of group signature by avoiding repetitive transmission of some variables. We assume that a signature is valid for at least a session of the FL. We also assume that the admin is the trusted third party for all communication members, including clients and servers. Admin communicates with the server to share the latest valid group signature for the session. Let us call this signature as <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma_{GS}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">σ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">G</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">S</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜎</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝐺</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑆</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\sigma_{GS}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Hence, to increase the unknown variable key size, we have increased the size of all three keys from 128-bits to 256-bits. The resulting size of the unknown key is still 256-bits compared to 384-bits earlier, but it is infeasible to break in real-time. Hence, it is safe to use. Please note that this signature is used for all iterations of the same session in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1. Problem Formulation ‣ 3.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have provided a formal security verification using AVISPA, which gives the result based on the goal of the algorithm. The algorithm is written in HLPSL code which checks for the authenticity and secrecy of the keys and secret messages. As a proof of concept, we configured to have six entities: server, client 1, client 2, client 3, client 4, and admin. At first, the server sends the global model to all clients in the network. Then, each client sends a group signature request to the admin, to which the admin replies with the necessary keys for the clients. Each client signs its message with the group signature and sends it to the server. The process is iterated. The goal of the algorithm comprises all the secret protocols, majorly named secrecy and authentication, as given below. The simulation code, written in HLPSL, shows that the algorithm can protect secrets between the admin (named A2) and the clients (named C1, C2, C3, and C4), and between the server (named S) and the clients. The proper authentication of all four clients is done, shown by the authentication code.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, we can compute the computation cost of existing algorithms.

Performance Analysis ‣ Efficient and Privacy Preserving Group Signature for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Since the encryption mechanism is not specified in refereed papers, we have assumed that all algorithms have used the ElGamal algorithm for cryptography. Since they have not mentioned any signatures, we have assumed other algorithms have used their digital signature to verify them. In the digital signature, a message is encrypted with the private key of the sender and decrypted at the receiver using the sender’s public key. So, we assumed two encryption and two decryption for a single transmission between two clients. The cost of the client-to-client communication needed for secure key transmission is denoted as <math id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C_{client-client}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">C</mi><mrow id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mrow id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml">l</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1a" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.4" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.4.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1b" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.5" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.5.cmml">e</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1c" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.6" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.6.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1d" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.7" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.7.cmml">t</mi></mrow><mo id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">−</mo><mrow id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">l</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1a" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1b" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.5" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.5.cmml">e</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1c" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.6" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.6.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1d" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.7" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.7.cmml">t</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐶</ci><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3"><minus id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></minus><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2"><times id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1"></times><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3">𝑙</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.4">𝑖</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.5.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.5">𝑒</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.6.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.6">𝑛</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.7.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.2.7">𝑡</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><times id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3">𝑙</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.4">𝑖</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.5.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.5">𝑒</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.6.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.6">𝑛</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.7.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.3.7">𝑡</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p4.1.m1.1c">C_{client-client}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

So, computing the average bandwidth for 1000 iteration will result in <math id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(1000\times 135+99\times 100\times 23)/1000=362.7" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml">1000</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml">135</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><mrow id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">99</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">100</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.4" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.4.cmml">23</mn></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><mo id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.cmml">1000</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">362.7</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"></eq><apply id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"><divide id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2"></divide><apply id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"><plus id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></plus><apply id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2"><times id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2">1000</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3">135</cn></apply><apply id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3"><times id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2">99</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3">100</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.4">23</cn></apply></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3">1000</cn></apply><cn type="float" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">362.7</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.I5.i2.p1.1.m1.1c">(1000\times 135+99\times 100\times 23)/1000=362.7</annotation></semantics></math> bytes.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a new group signature protocol to handle clients’ privacy preservation in federated learning. The proposed protocol efficiently integrates the traditional group signature with federated learning by considering the iterative learning process. Moreover, it does not contradict the architecture and assumptions of the traditional federated learning approach. We provided a mathematical analysis of the computation, communication, and signaling cost, which are closely associated with the performance of federated learning algorithms. Also, we have provided a comprehensive security analysis and proved the safety of the proposed protocol using a formal verification tool. Our protocol outperforms existing algorithms in terms of efficiency and handles various security attacks in the federated learning environment. There are still many challenges that remain. One of our future work is to handle dynamic changes in group members. We are also working on client selection of the federated learning process while the identity of the clients is hidden from the server.</p>
