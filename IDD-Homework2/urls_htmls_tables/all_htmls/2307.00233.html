<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Accurately estimating gas usage is essential for the efficient functioning of gas distribution networks and saving operational costs. Traditional methods rely on centralized data processing, which poses privacy risks. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution to this problem by enabling local data processing on each participant, such as gas companies and heating stations. However, local training and communication overhead may discourage gas companies and heating stations from actively participating in the FL training process.
To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical FL Incentive Mechanism for Gas Usage Estimation (<span id="id21.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>), which has been testbedded in the ENN Group, one of the leading players in the natural gas and green energy industry. It is designed to support horizontal FL among gas companies, and vertical FL among each gas company and heating station within a hierarchical FL ecosystem, rewarding participants based on their contributions to FL.
In addition, a hierarchical FL model aggregation approach is also proposed to improve the gas usage estimation performance by aggregating models at different levels of the hierarchy. The incentive scheme employs a multi-dimensional contribution-aware reward distribution function that combines the evaluation of data quality and model contribution to incentivize both gas companies and heating stations within their jurisdiction while maintaining fairness. Results of extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gas usage estimation is of paramount importance for energy companies like ENN Group<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">*</span>https://www.enn.cn/</span></span></span> as it enables them to accurately forecast and plan their gas purchase and distribution requirements. Accurate gas usage estimation ensures that the energy company can efficiently manage their gas distribution networks, avoid shortages or surpluses of gas supply, and ultimately minimize operational costs. Moreover, gas usage estimation is a critical component of the energy company’s efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and meet their sustainability goals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Le Quéré <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
However, the success of traditional methods for gas usage estimation is heavily reliant on large volumes of high-quality data. However, data from a single company may not be sufficient to train models effectively since data are often collected and owned by different organizations within a given field. Collaborative model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Warnat-Herresthal <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Chen <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> has been identified as a valuable technique to enhance the quality of ML solutions by leveraging the collective data resources of multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) is an important category of collaborative model training framework that has gained popularity due to its ability to protect data privacy and user confidentiality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL operates by having data owners (referred to as FL clients) train a local model using their private data samples, after which they submit model parameters (not raw training data) to a remote server. Once sufficient parameters from local models have been collected, a global model is aggregated and distributed to data owners for the next round of local training. This iterative process continues until the global model meets the predefined accuracy requirements. Through this training process, FL significantly enhances the data privacy of data owners since raw data is not uploaded.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the significant benefits of FL, it faces several critical challenges, making its further development and broader application in real-world industries challenging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zeng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Tu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Firstly, the data owners or clients typically consume their own resources, such as computing and communication resources for local training. As a result, self-interested clients may not be willing to contribute their resources for FL model training unless they receive sufficient economic compensation. Secondly, some unreliable clients may engage in undesirable behavior, which can negatively impact the performance of the global model for an FL task. In particular, a client may maliciously disturb its data and send low-quality updates to mislead the global model parameters, resulting in the failure of collaborative learning. These factors have given rise to FL incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Khan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Zhan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which can be defined as the process of identifying the most optimal payment and organizational structure for the federation to attain desired operational objectives.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Federated Learning Incentive Mechanism for Gas Usage Estimation (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>).
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span> is based on a hierarchical federated learning ecosystem composed of one horizontal FL and several vertical FL. The horizontal FL enables gas companies of ENN to leverage the historical gas supply information and weather data owned by others to make accurate gas usage estimations. On the other hand, the vertical FL is designed to facilitate collaboration between each gas company and the heating stations within their area of responsibility, taking into consideration that the data owned by each gas company and its associated heat stations are vertically-partitioned.
To incentivize active participation and ensure fairness among gas companies and heating stations, we incorporate a multi-dimensional contribution-aware reward distribution function that considers both data quality and model contributions to <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>. This hierarchical incentive scheme has proven effective in motivating participation and improving overall performance.
<span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span> has been successfully implemented in ENN Group in one province of China, and has allowed two gas companies in separate cities to improve their gas usage forecasting accuracy. It has been successful in motivating gas companies and heating stations to actively participate in FL training and commit high-quality data, resulting in increased revenue for these entities. To our best knowledge, it is the first successfully hierarchical federated learning incentive approach for the energy industry.</p>

However, this approach suffers from the possibility of dishonest reporting, where participants may overstate their contribution to receive a higher reward. As such, this approach is not ideal for large-scale and complex federated learning scenarios.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">ENN Group’s gas supply chain comprises two main participants: gas companies and heating stations. Gas companies purchase gas from external parties and then distribute it to heating stations within their jurisdiction.
However, it is challenging for both gas companies and gas stations to make precise predictions based on their own data. Gas companies face the problem of data sparsity, which makes it difficult for them to train accurate gas demand prediction models using only their own data samples. Meanwhile, heating stations rely on heating strategists to develop daily heating plans and estimate gas usage based on manually-generated weather forecasts. However, the subjectivity involved in manually formulating strategies and the lack of high-precision weather forecast data available to heating stations can adversely affect the performance of these plans.
In this sense, our solution involves two federated learning ecosystems: a horizontal one (HFL) show in fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 The proposed Hi-GAS Approach ‣ Hierarchical Federated Learning Incentivization for Gas Usage Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> among gas companies and several vertical ones (VFL) shown in fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 The proposed Hi-GAS Approach ‣ Hierarchical Federated Learning Incentivization for Gas Usage Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> among each gas company and the heating stations within in the area that it is responsible for.</p>

The SMAPE metric measures the difference between the actual and predicted values, normalized by the average of the actual and predicted values. Unlike other percentage error metrics, SMAPE takes into account both the magnitude and direction of the error. Additionally, SMAPE is symmetric, meaning that overprediction and underprediction are weighted equally. The resulting SMAPE score is expressed as a decimal, with lower values indicating better accuracy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Results and Discussion for RQ 1 ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Hierarchical Federated Learning Incentivization for Gas Usage Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> presents a comparison of the data quantity, data quality value, and model contribution value for one gas company in the ENN Group before and after adopting the proposed <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>. It is observed that the data quantity of the gas company decreases, while the data quality value increases significantly. This is because the gas company actively removed low-quality data when committing to the FL ecosystem after adopting <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>. This indicates that the proposed <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span> effectively motivates participants to provide high-quality data.</p>

This can be attributed to the gas company being motivated to provide more high-quality data to the FL ecosystem, thereby contributing more to the improvement of the entire ecosystem. It is worth noting that the gas company receives a total reward increase after adopting <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Hi-GAS</span>.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical FL Incentive Mechanism for Gas Usage Estimation, which we implemented in the ENN Group, a leading player in the natural gas and green energy industry. Our proposed mechanism involves a hierarchical FL ecosystem that includes horizontal FL among gas companies and vertical FL among each gas company and the heating stations within its jurisdiction. We also developed a hierarchical incentive scheme that rewards participants based on their contributions to FL.
The hierarchical aggregation approach enhances the gas usage estimation performance by aggregating models at different levels of the hierarchy. The incentive scheme employs a multi-dimensional contribution-aware reward distribution function that evaluates both data quality and model contribution to incentivize both gas companies and heating stations within their jurisdiction while ensuring fairness. Extensive experiment results validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.</p>
