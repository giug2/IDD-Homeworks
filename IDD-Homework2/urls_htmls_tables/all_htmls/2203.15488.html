<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising learning paradigm that can tackle the increasingly prominent isolated data islands problem while keeping users’ data locally with privacy and security guarantees. However, FL could result in task-oriented data traffic flows over wireless networks with limited radio resources.
To design communication-efficient FL, most of the existing studies employ the first-order federated optimization approach that has a slow convergence rate.
This however results in excessive communication rounds for local model updates between the edge devices and edge server.
To address this issue, in this paper, we instead propose a novel over-the-air second-order federated optimization algorithm to simultaneously reduce the communication rounds and enable low-latency global model aggregation.
This is achieved by exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel to implement the distributed second-order optimization algorithm over wireless networks.
The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is further characterized, which reveals a linear-quadratic convergence rate with an accumulative error term in each iteration.
We thus propose a system optimization approach to minimize the accumulated error gap by joint device selection and beamforming design.
Numerical results demonstrate the system and communication efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies under rapid development have been widely studied and deployed in various scenarios.
As a data-driven technology, its reliability and accuracy largely depend on the volume and quality of source data.
However, it is recognized as a big challenge for most enterprises to obtain a dataset with sufficient volume and quality for AI model training.
In the meantime, data privacy is another crucial issue that needs to be considered among different involved parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
To this end,
it is preferred in real-world implementations that data be kept locally,
forming a variety of isolated data islands.
This makes it difficult to directly aggregate data in the cloud and centrally train the AI models.
Therefore, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has emerged as a novel paradigm to address these challenges.
A generic and practical FL framework is essentially a distributed training process, and each iteration of FL includes the following three steps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Firstly, the server broadcasts the current global model parameters to all the involved devices. Next, each device performs local model training based on its local data and then sends the local updates back to the server.
Finally, the server aggregates the local updates and generates new global model parameters for the next iteration of distributed training. In essence, the server and devices aim to collaboratively solve a distributed optimization problem, which is typically referred to as <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Optimization</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Different from centralized optimization, federated optimization confronts several practical challenges including communication efficiency, data heterogeneity, security, system complexity, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Among them, communication efficiency is of utmost importance since the communication between the server and devices usually suffers from unreliable network connections, limited resources, and severe latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the communication issue, a large amount of research has been conducted in federated optimization. On the one hand, reducing the communication volume in each iteration is an effective method.
Specifically, quantization and sparsification techniques are employed to reduce the transmitted bits and remove the redundant updates of parameters, respectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
These compression techniques have shown remarkable effectiveness for high-dimensional models.
However, their design needs to consider the compatibility for the aggregation operation in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, minimizing the total communication rounds is another primary method. To this end,
zeroth-order methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have been investigated for some restrictive circumstances (e.g., black-box adversarial attack, non-smooth objective function) while showing great potential as only the objective function value is required to approximate derivative information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In the situation where gradients are available, first-order methods are widely used.
By increasing the amount of local computation, various gradient descent based methods have been shown that can significantly decrease the total number of communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, these existing approaches, i.e., zeroth-order and first-order approaches, are governed by the linear convergence in the best case.
As a result, the total number of iteration rounds required to achieve the desired accuracy is relatively large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, the second-order methods (e.g., Newton-type methods) become attractive in such a wireless environment due to their fast local quadratic convergence rate.
Nevertheless, the construction of the canonical Newton update requires both the Hessian and gradient information, where the distributed situation in FL makes gathering Hessian information a severe communication overhead.
To this end, second-order federated optimization algorithms have been investigated to resolve this issue, which can be divided into two categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
One is to use second-order information implicitly.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a mirror descent update is carried out on the local function to approximate the Hessian information.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the dual problems of the objective function are used to serve as the local subproblems.
The other category is to use second-order information explicitly.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a globally improved approximate Newton method (GIANT) using local Hessian for aggregation is proposed.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the optimization of the gradient’s norm acts as the surrogate function.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Hessian-vector product computation and conjugate gradient descent are performed on the devices and the server, respectively.
The fast convergence rate with efficient communication makes the application of these second-order algorithms a great benefit to FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the potential in the application of second-order algorithms to reduce the total communication rounds and improve the communication efficiency, the transmission of FL model parameters through wireless channels still confronts great challenges as wireless channels are always noisy with limited resources and high latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Based on the conventional “transmit-then-communicate” principle, the aggregation of FL model parameters can be achieved by digital coded transmission and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
By taking advantage of OMA and error correction techniques, local updates are transmitted separately in the quantized form and then decoded individually at the server.
In this way, the model transmission can be deemed to be reliable and trustworthy.
However, the increase in the number of devices will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in total communication latency and bandwidth requirement, which is often intolerable.
Therefore, a novel technique called over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> has emerged in FL algorithm design to decrease the communication cost based on the “compute-when-transmit” principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
This technique leverages the superposition property of multiple access channels to realize the aggregation operation.
Through the simultaneous transmission of all local updates, which are aggregated over the air, the communication overheads are significantly decreased.
Specifically, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed an AirComp-based approach for FL with joint design of device selection and beamforming to improve the statistical learning performance.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, a novel Gradient-Based Multiple Access (GBMA) algorithm was put forward to perform FL with an energy scaling law for approaching the convergence rate of centralized training.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated the power control optimization for enhancing the learning performance of over-the-air federated learning.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology was used to achieve fast yet reliable model aggregation for over-the-air federated learning.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed the dynamic learning rate design for AirComp-based FL.
Overall, the application of over-the-air computation in FL also improves the communication efficiency a lot.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above observations, this paper proposes to improve communication efficiency from two aspects, i.e., reducing communication rounds and the communication overhead in each round.
To reduce the communication rounds, we shall utilize second-order information during the training process of FL.
Due to the fast convergence speed, all these existing second-order state-of-the-arts have shown substantial improvement in terms of the total iteration rounds compared with first-order methods.
However, their iterative procedures still have at least two communication rounds per iteration, i.e., the aggregation of gradient and second-order information.
To avoid such two communication rounds, a recently proposed second-order method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> cuts down the aggregation of gradients and realizes one communication round per iteration.
Motivated by this, we adopt local Newton step aggregation for wireless FL algorithm design.
Specifically, the product of the local Hessian’s inversion and the local gradient is used to construct a local Newton step for aggregation.
By this means, the devices only need to communicate once with the server per iteration, cutting down the transmission of local Hessian matrices and local gradients while keeping the convergence behavior of canonical Newton’s method.
Moreover, due to the limited radio resources, we adopt over-the-air computation, which has been widely used in the existing wireless FL schemes, to further reduce the communication overheads in each round.
Based on this efficient local Newton step aggregation and AirComp technique, we propose an over-the-air second-order federated algorithm over wireless networks.
Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of our proposed method.
The results show that
the transmission of the above-mentioned product is sufficient to guarantee convergence and our proposed method outperforms first-order algorithms. To be specific,
the proposed algorithm keeps a linear-quadratic convergence rate, which means it can achieve the optimal point with a quadratic convergence rate and degenerate into the linear convergence rate when it is close enough to the optimal point.
However, as a result of local Newton step aggregation, device selection, and channel noise, there is an error term in each iteration. As the training proceeds, this accumulative error term will deflect the model parameters and affect learning performance. In order to mitigate the impact of this error term, we further propose a joint optimization approach of device selection and receiver beamforming.
Specifically, Gibbs Sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is adopted to determine the set of selected devices, and the difference-of-convex-functions (DC) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> is tailored to optimize the receiver beamforming during the iterative process of Gibbs Sampling.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As typical training algorithms, gradient descent methods (e.g., SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, batch gradient descent) are widely used.
However, the relatively slow convergence rate of gradient descent results in too many communication rounds between the server and devices to complete the learning task. Thus, many research works have been done to improve the communication efficiency of gradient descent in FL.
For example, some methods utilize multiple local updates to reduce the number of communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>,
while several algorithms employ compression techniques to reduce transmitted bits and save communication costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
Although these schemes have greatly improved the communication efficiency of gradient descent in FL, they are still limited by the linear convergence rate.

To resolve this issue, numerous second-order distributed machine learning algorithms have been proposed, such as DANE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, DISCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, GIANT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, DINGO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and DINO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
These methods approximate Hessian information in varied forms to avoid the direct transmission of Hessian matrices and approach the performance of canonical Newton’s method.
However, at least two communication rounds per iteration are required, including the aggregation of local gradients and second-order descent directions.
Different from these second-order algorithms, which require the aggregation of local gradients <math id="S2.SS2.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\nabla F_{i}\left(\bm{w}\right)"

By this means, the number of communication rounds required per iteration is reduced to one, further improving the communication efficiency.
Motivated by this, we leverage the local Newton step aggregation as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> to achieve a faster convergence rate with fewer communication rounds.

<p id="S2.I1.ix3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In practice, this step involves the computation of Hessian matrix and its inverse operation.
To reduce the computational complexity, we adopt the conjugate gradient method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> to obtain an approximate local Newton descent direction vector.
According to the analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, this approximate solution will not have a significant impact on the convergence behavior.</p>

Specifically, there are two communication-related steps in each iteration of our FL algorithm.
One is global model broadcasting in the downlink.

In order to eliminate this issue, we adopt a state-of-the-art technique named over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which is shown to be effective in assisting the analog aggregation in FL studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
This technique captures the nomographic function form of averaging the local descent direction vectors and implements the summation operation by the superposition property of the wireless channel.
In this way, the server can receive the summation by letting all devices transmit their local descent direction vectors simultaneously in each block.
Therefore, the entire process of model aggregation can be completed over the air in a single coherent block, and the communication overheads can be significantly reduced.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide the convergence analysis of our proposed algorithm.
A major challenge of convergence analysis is to tackle the distortion of the descent direction vector caused by channel noise,
device selection, and the use of local Newton step.
To address this issue, we study the impact of distortion with respect to these influencing factors.
In particular, we exploit the idea of sketching to analyze the approximation of local gradients and Hessian matrices.
To better elaborate our analysis, some preliminaries are firstly presented.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.17" class="ltx_p">The core of our proposed algorithm is using local Hessian matrices and local gradients, which is calculated through subsets of the total data set, to construct local Newton descent directions and aggregate them.
This brings the benefits of fewer communication rounds between the server and the devices.
However, since we rely on local information to approximate Newton descent directions, the quality of local Hessian/gradients, in other words, the difference between the local ones and global ones, are of concern.
In order to tackle this issue, we adopt the idea of matrix sketching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.12" class="ltx_p">The key to solving this low-rank optimization problem is to deal with the troublesome rank-one constraint.
A common method to solve such a problem is semidefinite relaxation (SDR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, which drops the rank-one constraint to obtain a relaxed problem in the form of semidefinite programming.
By this means, SDR can arrive at an approximate solution efficiently through solving the relaxed problem.
However, as the size of the problem grows, the rank-one constraint is usually unsatisfied.
In this situation, the approximate solution needs to be scaled through randomization methods, leading to an alternative solution with low accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, which will further affect the learning performance of FL.
To guarantee the rank-one constraint, we can replace it with its equivalent form <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>:

Then, the original problem turns into a difference-of-convex-function (DC) program.
By solving this DC program, a more precise solution can be obtained since all constraints are satisfied.
Therefore, we develop a DC Algorithm (DCA) based on the principles in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> to solve this
problem.
Specifically, we can get the following problem by taking the new constraint as a penalty term:

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, the device selection is a combinatorial optimization problem, which is impossible to perform a traversal in the whole solution space. Thus, we adopt the well-known Gibbs Sampling (GS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> method to optimize the selection of device set iteratively.
The main idea of GS is that in each iteration, a device set is sampled from the neighbors of the current device set according to an appropriate distribution.
In this way, the set of selected devices can gradually approach the global optimal solution.</p>

Regarding the optimality gap, benefiting from the linear-quadratic convergence rate, the proposed algorithm reaches a small optimality gap in the first few dozen communication rounds, while that of the first-order methods remains at a relatively higher level.
As for the test accuracy, our proposed algorithm can quickly reach and stabilize at a high accuracy level, while the first-order methods have relatively low and fluctuating accuracy.
Overall, our proposed algorithm keeps a quadratic convergence rate at the beginning of FL process, resulting in fewer communication rounds to complete the learning task than first-order algorithms.
This further leads to less wireless channel impact and better learning performance, as illustrated in the simulation results.</p>

It is observed that our proposed algorithm converges faster and remains stable at a relatively high level of accuracy, while the compared methods, AirComp-based GIANT and AirComp-based DANE, have a slower convergence rate.
This is because both the procedures of GIANT and DANE involve aggregating local gradients to calculate the global gradient in each iteration.
This extra transmission of local gradients through a wireless environment aggravates the impact of channel noise, leading to a relatively poor convergence rate.
Therefore, we can see that our proposed algorithm outperforms AirComp-based GIANT and AirComp-based DANE.</p>

The objective value of perfect aggregation does not depend on SNR and the number of antennas since the error during the FL process in this situation only comes from the approximation as (<a href="#S3.E27" title="In III-B2 The proposed algorithm is accompanied by an accumulative error term ‣ III-B Convergence Analysis ‣ III Theoretical Convergence Analysis ‣ Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Second-Order Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>) indicates.
The objective values of all settings decrease as SNR and the number of antennas increase, due to the mitigation of noise effect and the increase of diversity gain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, respectively.
However, the objective value of GS+DCA is smaller than that of other settings.
On the one hand, SDR fails to give a precise solution for the receiver beamforming vector as the size of the problem grows.
This further leads to the ineffectiveness of device selection in GS+SDR and worse performance compared with the settings using DCA to perform beamforming optimization.
On the other hand, device selection in GS+DCA mitigates the straggler issue caused by distance heterogeneity and data size heterogeneity, resulting in a better performance compared with DCA only.</p>

It reveals that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms.
On the one hand, it keeps a better convergence rate than first-order algorithms, leading to fewer communication rounds between the devices and the server.
On the other hand, compared with other second-order algorithms under over-the-air computation, the aggregation operation only occurs once per iteration in our proposed algorithm.
Therefore, our proposed algorithm is more communication-efficient than baseline algorithms in terms of both the total iteration rounds and the communication within each iteration, which further benefit learning performance, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-C Effectiveness of Proposed System Optimization Approach ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Second-Order Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a communication-efficient FL system by over-the-air second-order federated optimization algorithm.
The communication rounds and communication latency at each round can be simultaneously reduced.
This is achieved by leveraging the second-order information of the learning loss function for achieving fast convergence rates and exploiting the signal superposition property of a multiple access channel for fast model aggregation.
The characterized convergence behavior reveals a linear-quadratic convergence rate for the proposed algorithm.
As the proposed algorithm is accompanied by an accumulative error term in each iteration, a system optimization problem was formulated to minimize the total error gap while achieving a precise model. We then presented Gibbs Sampling and DC programming methods to jointly optimize device selection and receiver beamforming. The experimental results illustrated that our proposed algorithm and network optimization approach can achieve high communication efficiency for FL systems.
