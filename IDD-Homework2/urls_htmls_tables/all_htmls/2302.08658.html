<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Traffic flow forecasting (TFF) is of great importance to the construction of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To mitigate communication burden and tackle with the problem of privacy leakage aroused by centralized forecasting methods, Federated Learning (FL) has been applied to TFF. However, existing FL-based approaches employ batch learning manner, which makes the pre-trained models inapplicable to subsequent traffic data, thus exhibiting subpar prediction performance. In this paper, we perform the first study of forecasting traffic flow adopting Online Learning (OL) manner in FL framework and then propose a novel prediction method named Online Spatio-Temporal Correlation-based Federated Learning (FedOSTC), aiming to guarantee performance gains regardless of traffic fluctuation. Specifically, clients employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based encoders to obtain the internal temporal patterns inside traffic data sequences. Then, the central server evaluates spatial correlation among clients via Graph Attention Network (GAT), catering to the dynamic changes of spatial closeness caused by traffic fluctuation. Furthermore, to improve the generalization of the global model for upcoming traffic data, a period-aware aggregation mechanism is proposed to aggregate the local models which are optimized using Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm at clients. We perform comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method and the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of FedOSTC.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of Internet of Things (IoT) has quicken the construction progress of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which has aroused great interests in industry and academia<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In recent years, an increasing number of traffic nodes, e.g., traffic sensors and loop detectors are mounted along roads to generate overwhelming data for enhanced traffic service, e.g., traffic flow forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
By far, plenty of deep learning-based methods are proposed to improve performance gains in traffic flow forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants, e.g., Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Gated Recurrent Unit network (GRU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, are widespreadly used in forecasting traffic flow, due to the effectiveness of capturing temporal patterns inside traffic data sequences.
Besides, these methods combined with graphing approaches, such as Graph Neural Network (GNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or Graph Attention Network (GAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, can extract spatial correlation among traffic nodes, thus further increasing forecasting accuracy.
Despite prominent performance improvement, these methods are based on centralized learning strategy, which involves transmitting large quantities of privately-owned traffic data from decentralized traffic nodes to the central server for training prediction models.
This strategy yields considerable communication overhead and privacy concern, since private information (e.g., plate numbers) contained in traffic data may be leaked during data exchange.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a result, it is crucial to forecast traffic flow with keeping traffic data decentralized for mitigating communication burden and preserving privacy.
Federated Learning (FL), as a novel distributed computing paradigm can resolve the problem above, where traffic nodes (called clients) collaboratively train a prediction model based on their private data, and only exchange intermediate model parameters with the server for model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Owing to the merit of guaranteeing competitive forecasting performance without direct data transmission, there have been a few efforts in forecasting traffic flow depicting spatio-temporal correlation based on FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, all of these approaches employ batch learning manner, where prediction models are trained in advance based on batches of historical traffic data.
This coarse-grained manner of optimizing prediction models makes the optimized models fail to extensively capture the hidden temporal patterns in traffic flows.
Furthermore, due to traffic fluctuation, these optimized models easily suffer from poor prediction performance, when directly applied to the upcoming traffic data.
Therefore, these pre-trained models need to be repetitively trained, which incurs extra computation consumption, leads to delayed prediction, and fails to fulfill real-time prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Online Learning (OL) manner can break through the above-mentioned limitations, in which traffic nodes consistently update prediction models and preform predictions once they observe new traffic data.
Naturally, OL manner has the inherent advantages of real-time prediction and non-redundant deployment and hence applies to the task of traffic flow forecasting.
Traffic flows fluctuate severely at some time stamps, which poses great challenges to prediction models updated in batch learning manner.
However, in OL manner, the fine-grained optimization mechanism of prediction models can adapt to the dynamic changes of temporal patterns hidden in traffic flows, thus guaranteeing the prediction performance.
<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">To the best of our knowledge, there are no researches focusing on traffic flow forecasting employing OL manner in FL framework</span> and this article fills this research gap.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, there remain two main challenges to be tackled.
First, we should dynamically evaluate the spatial correlation among clients at each round so as to guarantee prediction performance, which remarkably increases the difficulty of prediction and model update. Second, existing FL approaches adopt the averaging mechanism to yield fresh global models which have poor performance on the subsequent traffic data, due to traffic fluctuation.
Therefore, it is necessary to explore the fluctuation patterns of traffic flow in the process of model aggregation so as to increase the generalization ability of global models and eventually improve performance gains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose a novel prediction method named <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">O</span>nline <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>patial-<span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>emporal <span id="S1.p7.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>orrelation-based <span id="S1.p7.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">F</span>ederated <span id="S1.p7.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">L</span>earning (FedOSTC) for traffic flow forecasting, which possesses excellent capabilities of dynamically capturing spatio-temporal dependence and boosting model adaptation regardless of traffic fluctuation.
Specifically, a GRU with encoder-decoder architecture is regarded as the prediction model and trained collaboratively by multiple traffic nodes.
The temporal patterns inside traffic flows are captured independently via encoders at clients (traffic nodes).
Then, the central server adaptively evaluates spatial closeness from temporal patterns using GAT, which can mitigate the effect of traffic fluctuation on spatial correlation.
Relying on the instantly-captured spatio-temporal correlation, clients perform prediction and then incrementally optimize model parameters using Online Gradient Descent (OGD).
Finally, based on the observation of periodic patterns of traffic flows, we generate fresh global models using the newly-developed period-aware aggregation mechanism rather than averaging mechanism, which can increase the generalization of global models for subsequent traffic flows.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A great variety of methods have been proposed to increase the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting.
Overall, existing methods can be divided into two categories: parametric and non-parametric methods.
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and its variants are classical parametric methods and have been researched extensively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
However, this series of methods have limitations in regressing traffic flows with high fluctuation, because they are based on the assumption that traffic flows have stationary distribution, which is not the case in reality.
Non-parametric methods are based on machine learning models, e.g., Graph Network (GN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and RNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
GN-based methods are devoted to evaluating spatial correlation among multiple nodes based on the constructed topology network, while RNN can capture temporal dependence inside traffic sequences.
Therefore, many researches combine GN approaches and RNN to measure spatio-temporal correlation and have achieved satisfactory performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent researches pay attention to forecasting traffic flow using FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Qi <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> treated the vehicles as clients and introduced the blockchain to avoid the single point of failure. This scenario is not similar to ours.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, Liu <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> and Zhang <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> investigated a similar scenario where traffic sensors mounted along roads belong to some certain organizations.
The traffic data detected by sensors should be directly transmitted to the organizational servers for training, also confronting with excessive communicating burden.
In order to preserve privacy, multiple organizational servers adopt FL manner to collaboratively train the prediction model. However, the two proposed methods are far from reasonable, because only the spatial correlation among intra-organization nodes is evaluated and that of inter-organization ones is ignored, the lack of which leads to low forecasting accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the above researches, Meng <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a model named cross-node federated graph neural network (CNFGNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
In this work, each traffic sensor serves as a client, and GNN is utilized to capture the spatial relation at the central server.
However, in the backpropagation process of GNN, the central server has to communicate with clients for updating parameters, which incurs considerable communication overhead.
Besides, since the transportation graph composed by clients at each round remains unchanged, the captured spatial correlation among multiple clients barely changes, thus failing to cater for traffic fluctuation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given the dynamic changes of traffic flow, our work mainly focuses on designing an online method for dynamically capturing spatio-temporal correlation among traffic nodes in FL framework, which is quite different from the above researches.</p>

Specifically, we propose a novel spatio-temporal correlation evaluation mechanism which includes obtaining hidden temporal patterns inside traffic speed sequences using GRU-based encoders at clients and assessing spatial correlation among clients at the central server.
After that, we update local prediction models using OGD algorithm at clients.
Based on the periodic patterns inside traffic flows, we further propose a period-aware aggregation mechanism to generate the fresh global model.
Then, we elaborate the process of the proposed FedOSTC in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm2" title="In IV-B2 Period-Aware Aggregation Mechanism at the Server ‣ IV-B Prediction Model Update ‣ IV Methodology ‣ Online Spatio-Temporal Correlation-Based Federated Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

Firstly, clients capture the hidden temporal patterns inside speed sequences respectively with GRU-based encoders.
Then the central server measures the spatial correlation among clients using GAT and returns the updated hidden temporal patterns to clients.
Finally, clients input the updated hidden patterns into the decoders to generate the predicted results.</p>

Based on this, traffic speed observations at different clients are definitely correlated with each other.
When a certain client makes prediction, historical traffic speed observations of the adjacent clients should be also taken into consideration.
However, since raw traffic data stored at clients cannot be shared for privacy preservation, it is infeasible to capturing spatial correlation among clients using raw data like many centralized methods.</p>

The distributions of temporal patterns and traffic sequences after dimensional reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A2 Evaluating Spatial Correlation Among Clients at the Server ‣ IV-A Spatio-Temporal Correlation Evaluation ‣ IV Methodology ‣ Online Spatio-Temporal Correlation-Based Federated Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
We mark different clients in different colors and can observe that “circles” and “triangles” have the same distribution.
Based on this, we utilize temporal patterns output by encoders as the alternative to raw traffic speed for the assessment of spatial correlation among clients.</p>

At each global round, the server transmits current global model to clients.
Encoders at clients input traffic sequences and output the temporal patterns of these traffic sequences (Line 23-25).
The server evaluates the spatial correlation among clients using GAT, and then updates hidden states from clients (Line 16).
When clients receive the updated hidden states from the server, they make prediction, calculate prediction loss and optimize parameters of encoders and decoders via OGD, which is iterated for <math id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">E</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝐸</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.6.m6.1c">E</annotation></semantics></math> epochs (Line 17-20).

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the scenario of traffic flow forecasting, the observed traffic speeds from clients have different distribution. While in FL framework, all clients train a same prediction model cooperatively. We hope the global prediction model from the central server has good generalization ability so that all clients can achieve satisfactory performance. Therefore, in this subsection, we compare model generalization ability of the four methods based on FL framework. The prediction RMSEs of clients on two datasets with different forecasting steps are illustrated in Fig.<a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Comparisons of Forecasting Performance ‣ V Experiments ‣ Online Spatio-Temporal Correlation-Based Federated Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
By comparing FedAvgOff and CNFGNN with FedAvgOn and FedOSTC respectively, we can observe that RMSE variance of OL manner is much smaller than that of batch learning manner, which indicates that OL manner can yield global model with better generalization ability in FL.
Furthermore, the prediction RMSE of FedOSTC is lower than that of FedAvgOn for almost all clients. The RMSE variance over all clients in FedOSTC is obviously lower than that in FedAvgOn. Therefore, by adopting the proposed spatio-temporal correlation evaluating mechanism and period-aware weighted aggregation mechanism, FedOSTC can increase the generalization ability of global model.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel method named FedOSTC for traffic flow forecasting.
To boost prediction performance, we dynamically assessed spatio-temporal correlation among clients.
Specifically, the temporal patterns inside traffic data sequences are obtained at clients.
Since spatial correlation among clients varies with traffic fluctuation, the spatial dependence of the observed traffic data is assessed dynamically via GAT.
Given the periodic changes of traffic flows, we proposed a period-aware aggregation mechanism to aggregate the online-updated local models, aiming to improve the generalization of the fresh global model for the subsequent traffic data.
Last but not least, we conducted extensive experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets to verify the effectiveness of OL manner in traffic flow forecasting and the superiority of FedOSTC, compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Given the observation that larger local epochs yield higher prediction accuracy but more computation sources, we will explore the balance between computation overhead and prediction performance in the future research and refine FedOSTC from the aspects of reducing communication overhead, decreasing forecasting time, etc.</p>
