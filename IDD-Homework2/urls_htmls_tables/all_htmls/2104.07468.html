<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Data sharing remains a major hindering factor when it comes to adopting emerging AI technologies in general, but particularly in the agri-food sector. Protectiveness of data is natural in this setting: data is a precious commodity for data owners, which if used properly can provide them with useful insights on operations and processes leading to a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, novel AI technologies often require large amounts of training data in order to perform well, something that in many scenarios is unrealistic. However, recent machine learning advances, e.g. federated learning and privacy-preserving technologies, can offer a solution to this issue via providing the infrastructure and underpinning technologies needed to use data from various sources to train models without ever sharing the raw data themselves. In this paper, we propose a technical solution based on federated learning that uses decentralized data, (i.e. data that are not exchanged or shared but remain with the owners) to develop a cross-silo machine learning model that facilitates data sharing across supply chains. We focus our data sharing proposition on improving production optimization through soybean yield prediction, and provide potential use-cases that such methods can assist in other problem settings. Our results demonstrate that our approach not only performs better than each of the models trained on an individual data source, but also that data sharing in the agri-food sector can be enabled via alternatives to data exchange, whilst also helping to adopt emerging machine learning technologies to boost productivity.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The agri-food supply chain is a complex and highly valuable sector in the world economy, yet the hostility that arises from competitive advantage has snuffed the possibility of collaboration and openness in data sharing that has the potential to benefit all parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Data sharing can help address historical failings related to transparency and traceability of adulterated or unsafe food vertically through the supply chain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Substantial work has been done to address the traceability of food and drink with added pressure from consumer demands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, in this work we address the data sharing horizontally across the supply chain, as to assist in production optimization or regulatory reporting with the aim to contribute towards the recent international commitments and ambitious goals for sustainability imposed throughout the agri-food supply chain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Specifically, we focus on the implementation of data driven technologies such as machine learning, to gain a statistical insight into a holistic view of data from multiple sources. Moreover, we do so via our proposition for technological methods that facilitate trustworthy data sharing providing a holistic view of a system for optimization or regulatory purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many of the thorniest challenges of data sharing within agri-food arise from social concerns, perhaps foremost concerns around commercial sensitivity and the resulting reluctance to share, fearing competitive and reputational risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. A reluctance to share data may be preventing sector gains from data analytic methodologies (e.g. machine learning) that would allow improved production optimization and environmental data analysis. This fundamental hurdle is the motivation of our work, asking the question: Can we propose technological solutions to facilitate confidence in information sharing within the agri-food sector? Specifically, can we maintain independent ownership of actors’ data whilst employing data analysis methodologies to improve production optimization between all actors?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Production optimization across competitors’ activities is an obvious example of the potential gains to be made through analyzing shared agri-food data. Training predictive models on a greater quantity and variety of data from different data owners is likely to produce a more generalizable and better performing model than separate models produced individually by each data owner on their own data. Our goal is to consider methods that can improve on separate, individual models while still not disclosing individual sensitive data. We demonstrate our solution to this goal through
the task of soybean yield prediction, where individual models refers to a model trained on a specific subset of the data belonging to that particular organization only, in our case between US states. The ultimate aim is to move toward the analytic benefits of models trained on pooled data, while avoiding the data pooling itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We focus our investigation around the use of data driven technologies across the agri-food supply chain (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">horizontally</em>, rather than <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">vertically</em> through the chain given the already vast exploration into this problem setting where the vertical integration has typically been addressed by blockchain technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>). We aim to provide technological solutions to enable trustworthy information sharing among participants across the supply chain that have the ability to provide optimization improvements to support environmental and regulatory concerns. In particular, we trial federated learning (FL) approach and ensemble of models via model sharing to encapsulate many of the established methods in machine learning for agri-food, while not requiring direct data-pooling between competitors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">FL is an approach to machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which involves training a centralized model collaboratively through many clients whilst keeping client data decentralized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Thus, the decentralization of data promotes privacy preservation between individual client data whilst producing trained models that leverage all data of all participating clients. We argue that this setting, specifically the ‘cross-silo’ (few clients that each represent a larger repository of data) provides a potential opportunity to address the challenges faced with distrust in data sharing, producing cooperatively shared models whilst maintaining data independence. Federated learning alone does not prevent all malicious attacks, specifically inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> are a significant concern, however to build trust we explore and subsequently demonstrate how the proven theoretical privacy can be achieved in the federated setting through the adoption of differential privacy methods at a participant level. We hope the proposition and initial empirical demonstration of such technologies in the agri-food setting supporting confidence in privacy-preserving methods for information sharing, sparking change in the perceptions of data sharing to build a more sustainable future for agri-food.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To showcase the potential of FL, ensembles of shared models and differential privacy to facilitate trust for data sharing in agri-food setting, we employ well established open-source datasets for crop yield prediction from both imaging (remote sensing) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and tabular (weather and soil data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> data domains. We demonstrate how data independence and privacy preserving methods perform compared to their traditional machine learning counterparts, with the aim to empirically illustrate that under the restricted conditions of independence and differential privacy these training regimes can produce competitive models.

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As our aim is to propose technological solutions to facilitate and subsequently begin to build confidence in data sharing, as well as to potentially encourage those in agri-food to participate, we provide example use cases where we see data sharing in agri-food via distributed training to be most applicable. For this work we primarily focus on production optimization for collaborative federations for our empirical demonstration given the accessibility to open-source datasets. However, the advocated training procedures are directly applicable to the other use cases. We give two key use case problems observed in the agri-food sector that we believe data sharing and collaborative training can assist, this list is not exhaustive.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">The addition of more data from a variety of sources and multiple farms vastly improves performance of data driven technologies. In the agri-food sector, soft fruit growers for example, can in some cases be limited by their data collection resources, yet they may wish to employ data analytic to improve not only profits but also their sustainability (net-zero targets). Another angle to this relates to contractual agreements between growers and large retail supermarkets for instance; over- or under- estimating the amount of produce can lead to fruit waste or fruit shortages respectively, that can have both financial and environmental repercussions for growers and the whole sector. The concept of federations like that explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> facilitated through our proposed federated learning procedure can enable multiple growers to share data in a trustworthy manner to improve their own production systems.</p>

<br class="ltx_break"></span>In many cases statistical analysis of a product distributed to clients is beneficial to the supplier. This in turn benefits all participants as data analytical approaches can lead to product improvement tailored to the clients. Like with production optimization, a federated learning setting can allow the central sever (i.e. distribution source) to coordinate training to produce a global statistical model of all their clients so as to gain insights from a holistic view of the data. In the fresh food industry, such an approach can optimize food availability, reduce transport costs, reduce food waste, and contribute to the financial prosperity of all actors involved.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data sharing has not been as widespread in the agri-food sector as in other domains, such as medical and genomic research, where the realization of how data sharing can improve and accelerate scientific research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has outweighed commercial gain of maintaining local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. While work has taken place in tackling issues of transparency and traceability through technologies such as blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, true sharing (direct sharing of raw, unprocessed data between parties) of data between actors is typically uncommon within organizational settings. Despite continued support from EU governments for data sharing in agriculture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, recent studies examining the regulatory framework of agricultural data sharing have highlighted the significant extent of the social and technological challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The use of machine learning within agri-food has seen successful application in yield prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, crop disease detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and production safety <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. We suggest that many of these already impactful advancements can be replicated (or at least approximated) without direct data pooling, thus making them much more widely usable. To demonstrate our intuition under the setting of multiple, independent data silos, we give an example of model sharing and decentralized training via federated learning, which has not yet seen widespread application in agri-food.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL trains machine learning algorithms in a decentralized manner, maintaining principles of focused collection, data minimization, and mitigation of systemic privacy risks associated from traditional centralized methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Introduced in 2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, FL has since seen adoption in mobile device infrastructure from tech giants<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and IoT networks. Recently, federated approaches have moved into the mainstream with primary research on extremely large scale ‘cross-device’ settings with millions of edge devices (clients), and continued privacy-preserving implementations. In contrast, our work focuses on the ‘cross-silo’ setting where there are few clients each of which represents a larger data store - this setting is more representative of individual companies or organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">At the core of FL, privacy preserving mechanisms enable the facilitation of confident and trustworthy data mining between independent and decentralized data stores. Under the cross-silo setting there is typically less interest in protecting data from the public domain given the models are generally only released to those who participate in training, and as such more emphasis is placed on inter-client privacy. Although many of the privacy preservation schemes explored defend from such public attacks, while secure communication pipelines like secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> can help reduce such risks. One extensively explored approach is differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a methodology introducing uncertainty into the released models as to sufficiently mask the contributions of individual data and as such, limit the information disclosure about individual clients. Lately, more emphasis has been placed on more theoretically secure methods of privacy preserving, such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), performing computational operations on encrypted data without first decrypting it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, training large statistical models to provide a holistic analysis of data requires the collection of many data points typically originating from various independent collections. Informally, this can be considered as bringing the data to the model for training, pooling multiple data silos (independent datasets/databases belonging to an single client or participant <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> organization, county, nation) into a centralized data store. However, as mentioned this unification and direct data sharing is deemed impractical in the agri-food sector due to privacy concerns, distrust and subsequent risk to commercial sensitivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. One particular example implication being addressed by distributed training is the direct analysis of yield information and the subsequent inference of sensitive financial information. Removing the ability of participants to access other participant data mitigates such trivial attacks. Following such an example we ask, <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">can we train machine learning models that leverage data from many individual data silos without explicitly sharing or centralizing data?</span> This in-turn focuses our investigation to first undertake the task of distributed training on multiple independent data silos, and secondly ensure data privacy is maintained through appropriate mechanisms to elicit trust.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle distributed training we explore model sharing, transferring independently trained models rather than data itself (Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Model Sharing ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), and federated learning for training an aggregated model on multiple independent data silos simultaneously (Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Federated Learning ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). This scenario represents the case whereby clients want to protect their own data, hence being reluctant to share them with other growers. The current availability of real-world data belonging to many different organizations or groups of the same type is limited within the agri-food setting, and thus we simulate the case of multiple, independent, distributed data-stores by partitioning two well established, open-source datasets comprised of five subsets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> into sub-sets each representing a separate data silo.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To adequately compare the performance of our proposed approaches, and to empirically support our agenda of augmenting traditional machine learning with distributed learning algorithms in agri-food, we employ the two benchmark datasets aforementioned to measure performance.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The overarching principles presented by model sharing and the ensemble-based training regime demonstrate the potential for information sharing without disclosing raw data. Although these methods show adequate performance (Section <a href="#S7.SS2" title="7.2 Model Sharing Performance ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7.2</span></a>), there exists more appropriate methods to leverage the distributed, independent datasets attributed to our problem setting. We focus now on a natural extension to sharing trained models among participants, instead, training a single model via the simultaneous communication of individual model updates by each participant. Known as federated learning, we aim to solve our machine learning problem defined in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Problem Setting ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> collaboratively via multiple participants under the coordination of a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> without disclosing or sharing raw data rather sharing model updates (i.e. weights and biases).</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, federated learning is described in a <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device</span> setting where there are potentially millions of participants each with an unique dataset (i.e. IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and mobile phones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>), however there are also many settings where federated learning can be applicable to a relatively few number of participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. The latter is known as <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</span> federated learning and specifically differs from cross-device by the quantity, size and availability of the participants data. As alluded to in the name, cross-silo federated learning collaboratively trains a shared model on siloed data — data is partitioned by example and also by features, where in our problem setting the features are independent among participants — that tends to be almost always available, typical of our problem setting where individual organization’s data can be reasonably considered as data silos. We will refer to the cross-silo setting when discussing federated learning throughout this work.</p>

<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As inferred from the previous definition and description of the federated learning training procedure, explicit privacy advantages can be observed in comparison to traditional machine learning training on centralized and persisted data. Most obvious is the distributed nature of the data held by the clients, maintaining data independence and subsequently addressing issues related to trust and commercial sensitivity of the agri-food sector identified and discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In addition, it has been well understood how such methods fit into legislative limitations regarding GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> further introducing regulatory confidence in such a methodology to maintain data privacy between clients.</p>

<div id="S5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Focusing further on our particular problem setting of the agri-food sector, the concept of a central communication server could potentially introduce obstacles that relate to malicious information retrieval. One such approach to address this is to consider the concept of data trusts as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. This introduces a trusted party to maintain and facilitate the central server communication. Additionally, methods such as differential privacy can further alleviate concerns of malicious attacks on the global and local models obtained via interception of communications or through legitimate means during the sharing procedure between all participants, this is elaborated on in Section <a href="#S8" title="8 Discussion ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S5.SS1.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FederatedAveraging</span> algorithm provides the basis for the implementation of many federated learning systems. However, in most real-world cases and including our problem setting, there exist complications regarding data that is not independently and identically distributed (iid). In our particular setting of the agri-food sector, it is likely that <span id="S5.SS1.p1.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">feature shifts</span> are the most common factor in non-iid data. Informally, a feature shift may result from a difference in local measurement devices or sensitivity of measurements used to obtain the data for each of the local participant data silos. This shift in feature distribution can lead to significant performance degradation as each local model is trained on a distribution that is not aligned with other clients.

At test time, inference is performed on the models from each state computing a prediction of yield for that state, these predictions are averaged over all the individual models trained on each local data silo. This methodology follows our initial proposition most simply as to share information captured by the machine learning models rather than the data itself. Such an approach is empirically shown in Table <a href="#S7.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 7.3 Cross-Silo Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, <a href="#S7.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 7.3 Cross-Silo Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and <a href="#S7.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 7.3 Cross-Silo Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> to perform well across all modalities in the task of crop yield prediction with an approximate 1.32% and 9.09% increase in RMSE for the image and tabular modalities respectively from local baselines.</p>

We conjecture this improvement is attributed to the variability in the sources and as such the average prediction represents a more generalized view across state conditions. However, when comparing to traditional learning baseline we observe the expected but significant performance derogation. This can primarily be attributed to quantity and variability of data present in each data silo, where overfitting observed for each local model during training with identical model architecture (to maintain fair experimentation). This is particularly relevant to the remote sensing data where the datasets per silo are comparatively small, in the tabular modality we observe a less significant drop in performance due to the larger dataset size. To further evaluate this hypothesis on the remote sensing dataset, we reduce the number of silos to 4 and therefore increasing the size of each local silo dataset, subsequently we see some improvement to an average 6.023 RMSE for the CNN model, yet this is still limited by quantity of data.</p>

Federated learning leverages all data from all silos via the aggregation of model updates, and resultantly produces a model that is not only effectively trained on the union of the individual datasets simultaneously, but also captures the variability in the model from this union.

More importantly, we observe how federated learning training performs nearly identically to traditional training baseline, with a small but expected disparity in performance, 6.68%.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thus far in this paper, we have conducted an empirical demonstration of how data sharing can be enabled through distributed and data independent machine learning training, maintaining an adaptable level of privacy with the hope to showcase how collaborative learning can be achieved without disclosure of commercially sensitive information. Our example implementations address an established and highly sought after problem of production optimization in a distributed setting for two modalities of data, images and tabular samples. This is just one potential use case that aims to demonstrate how a federation or consortium of individual actors can leverage shared data to improve production optimization, there exist many other potential benefits as described in Section <a href="#S1.SS1" title="1.1 Use cases ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1.1</span></a> that help achieve improved food safety and sustainability to meet a variety of regulatory requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, our empirical analysis demonstrates the applicability of such methods for appropriate in agri-food production optimization machine learning tasks. Specifically, we show that the federated setting under both dataset modalities performs exceptionally well achieving results that are considered extremely close to traditional machine learning baselines with a 5.32% and 6.68% reduction in RMSE for the image and tabular dataset respectively. Significantly, we also show that our proposed methods outperform the locally trained models further solidifying our proposition that data or information sharing can benefit all parties involved to produce better performing models. We based our comparison and definition of adequate performance on the original baseline papers for each corresponding dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and our replicating baseline models on identical datasets with some small alterations to the networks defined in Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Experimental Results ‣ The Role of Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Facilitating Data Sharing in the Agri-Food Sector" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. Across both datasets we achieve greater performance than reported in both original works, and our federated setting performs better than or around the reported values. We consider these results to be a great success demonstrating the potential of these data independent methods for training on complex dataset. On the other hand, we also observe that our ensemble of shared models in the remote imaging setting does not perform in a threshold we would consider ideal, this can be primarily attributed to the dataset size and difficulty of training small sets with an over parameterized model (model architectures remained the same for direct comparison of training procedure) as explained previously. Additionally, we conjecture that the ensemble of shared models’ performance deficit can also be attributed to the statistical heterogeneity between local data silos and as such when testing on a different silos test data the trained models may have difficulty addressing the present feature shift.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Vitally, our methods aim to elicit confidence and trust in participants via privacy preservation techniques that demonstrate theoretic guarantees to maintain privacy. Most obviously is the maintenance of data independence and removal of raw data sharing, whilst still being able to collaboratively train machine learning models. Moreover, we address the concerns around the malicious attempts to obtain training data from the shared information, a significant implication regarding commercial sensitivity among participants. The nature of distributed training allows for additional technologies to be used in tandem to help introduce more stringent privacy measures. In practice there exist other privacy preserving machine learning approaches, such as fully-homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, that could facilitate more confidence in data sharing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As previously alluded when defining our methods, there still exist social and political challenges in adoption of distributed training for data sharing. Most notably, the coordination of training on individual participant data and distribution of trained models to participants may introduce concerns of competitive advantage from the coordinating party. Our work provides processes that solve the core social implications of trust in sharing raw data further removing this necessity, yet the understanding of the processes by the participants is they driving factor to changing perspectives.

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many of the agri-food sector’s implications involving transparency and holistic data analysis stem from technological lagging, and hostility to data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> that can inevitably lead to difficulties meeting many of the mandatory requirements in an efficient manner. We proposed the use of distributed, machine learning training procedures to overcome the strong social barriers relating to commercial sensitivity and unwillingness to share raw data. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time this type of machine learning setting, specifically federated learning, is explored in the agri-food sector which could potentially benefit the industry and consumers as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div id="S9.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We give theoretical descriptions and empirical evidence that the proposed methods will not only provide privacy guarantees supporting the facilitation of data sharing and collaborative machine learning training, but also perform close to their traditionally trained machine learning counterparts. The performance demonstrated gives further credibility to such methods for training machine learning models in a collaborative setting providing knowledge that performance can be guaranteed and improved with more data from differing sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S9.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The field of distributed and privacy preserving machine learning is growing rapidly, where these methods are becoming evermore relevant in industry, we believe this work is just the start point for the adoption of large scale distributed computation in agri-food. Direct future work aims to showcase the implementation of these propositions in the real-world setting whilst further addressing the issues regarding statistical heterogeneity as well as addressing the social, political challenges present in data sharing. Moving forward we aim to further develop a more concrete pipeline from data to model output addressing communication, central servers and regulatory implications to achieve a standard in collaborative and data sharing procedures across the food supply chain.</p>
