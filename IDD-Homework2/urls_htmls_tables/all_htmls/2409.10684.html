<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.id1">Text-To-Music (TTM) models have recently revolutionized the automatic music generation research field. Specifically, by reaching superior performances to all previous state-of-the-art models and by lowering the technical proficiency needed to use them. Due to these reasons, they have readily started to be adopted for commercial uses and music production practices. This widespread diffusion of TTMs poses several concerns regarding copyright violation and rightful attribution, posing the need of serious consideration of them by the audio forensics community. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detection and attribution of TTM-generated data. We propose a dataset, FakeMusicCaps that contains several versions of the music-caption pairs dataset MusicCaps re-generated via several state-of-the-art TTM techniques. We evaluate the proposed dataset by performing initial experiments regarding the detection and attribution of TTM-generated audio.</p>

The nature of FakeMusicCaps makes it easy to incorporate future TTMs by simply generating music examples using the same procedure. We perform a benchmark study, on FakeMusicCaps, by studying if it is possible to perform detection and attribution, i.e. classifying the input music as either real or belonging to one of the chosen TTM models. We analyze how the model performs both in closed set or open set scenarios, where the latter also includes data belonging to generators not seen during training, which in this paper belong to the SunoCaps dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.10684v2#bib.bib33" title="">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

We instead focus on open-source TTMs and consider commercial ones only in the open set classification.

To create FakeMusicCaps, we use the caption from MusicCaps and for each one of them we generate a corresponding 10-second audio track using models (TTM01-TTM05) for a total of 27605 music tracks corresponding to almost 77 hours. Since the objective of the dataset is to provide an initial dataset for the analysis of the detection and attribution of music generated via TTM models, we adopt an audio pipeline that ensures that all audios are represented using the same format.

In all metrics, the best performances are obtained by ResNet18 + Spec, while RawNet2 obtains slightly worse results than M5. From the inspection of the confusion matrices, we can see that ResNet18 slightly confounds TTM03 (AudioLDM2) with TTM05(Mustango), both diffusion-based models. M5 has slightly lower performances in detecting the ground-truth data, while RawNet2 struggles more to detect model TTM02 (MusicLDM).</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p3.1">As expected, in this case performance is much worse for all considered models. If we look at the results reported in the two tables, we can see that again ResNet18 + Spec obtains the best performance using both methods and that results obtained via the SVM technique are much worse than the ones obtained via the thresholding approach. The perspective however becomes different if we look at the confusion matrices. In the thresholding method, we can see that ResNet18 + Spec obtains the best performance when classifying the known methods, but misclassifies all the audio excerpts belonging to the UNKNWN class. Interestingly enough, these are confounded with the real examples, which is somewhat expected, given that the commercial model Suno is probably the most realistic of the considered TTM models. M5 and RawNet2 obtain somehow similar performance, with the former confounding UNKNWN examples with real and MusicGen-generated ones, while the latter confounds them mostly with MusicGen.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS4.p1.1">The objective of the results provided in this paper is to present a first approach to the TTM model detection and attribution and do not claim at all to be definitive. Instead, we hope to further motivate research in this direction. New TTM models are proposed almost monthly if not daily, with a continuous increase in quality, especially for what concerns commercial models. For these reasons, while from the results indicated in this paper the problem may seem to be relatively easy, especially in the closed-set scenario, things are not going to stay that way for long and the research community needs to prepare in advance to solve problems related to the detection of fake music. We can already identify a few developments not analyzed in this paper that could be considered in future works related to TTM attribution. For example, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1">Do the textual descriptions have an effect on the classification performance?</span> If text and music are effectively mutually dependent, in the scenario of TTM models, we could be able to leverage on that. Also, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2">Can we leverage music theory and musicology to detect music deepfakes?</span> The analysis of musical theory could be of interest in a context where generated music is inserted in otherwise “real” music, a problem denoted as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.3">splicing.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">In this paper, we tackled the problem of detecting and attributing music generated via Text-to-music models. Specifically, we introduced the FakeMusicCaps dataset, created by replicating the MusicCaps dataset via five state-of-the-art TTM models. By applying simple audio forensics techniques, we demonstrate that the dataset could be used as an initial benchmark to tackle TTM detection and attribution. Our results are not to be considered definitive, instead, our objective is to further motivate the research in forensics techniques for the analysis of generated music. In fact, while the problem of fake music detection and attribution is now relatively simple, it is guaranteed to grow more extremely complicated day by day.</p>
