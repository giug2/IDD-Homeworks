<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is revolutionizing how we learn from data. With its growing popularity, it is now being used in many safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare. Since thousands of participants can contribute in this collaborative setting, it is, however, challenging to ensure security and reliability of such systems. This highlights the need to design FL systems that are secure and robust against malicious participants’ actions while also ensuring high utility, privacy of local data, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel FL framework dubbed as <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> that utilizes benign data from FL participants to validate the local models before taking them into account for generating the global model. This is in stark contrast with existing defenses relying on server’s access to clean datasets—an assumption often impractical in real-life scenarios and conflicting with the fundamentals of FL. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> framework in different settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in thwarting various types of poisoning and backdoor attacks including a defense-aware one. <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> also preserves privacy of local data against gradient inversion attacks.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a collaborative learning technique that allows multiple participants to jointly train a machine learning (ML) model without sharing their own training data.
Each participant trains their local model and shares their local updates with the server which then aggregates the updates to generate a global model and sends it back to the participants.
This technique has two important features. Firstly, it can produce a model that is trained on a vast quantity of data provided by thousands of participants without compromising their data privacy. Secondly, decentralized training allows parallelization of the computation across multiple devices resulting in a significant speed boost in the training process.
Due to these attractive features, FL technique has been adopted to solve problems in many diverse domains such as autonomous vehicles<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>,

</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The growing adoption of FL systems necessitates a comprehensive investigation of their robustness and security.
Security concerns arise from the involvement of numerous clients including potential adversaries aiming to disrupt the learning process.
Designing an efficient and effective vetting scheme for such a large number of participants is challenging.
Malicious clients may attack FL systems by sending local model updates trained on poisoned data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
or by intentionally poisoning local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, two categories of attacks have garnered significant attention: <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">poisoning</em> attacks that aim to corrupt the global model and <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">inference</em> attacks targeting the theft of local participant data.
Poisoning attacks are executed by malicious participants seeking to compromise the global model by sending malicious updates.
Attackers may aim to produce a global model with poor performance on the primary task (untargeted poisoning attack) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>
or one that performs poorly on a specific class (i.e., targeted poisoning attack) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
Another possible goal is to create a global model that behaves according to the attacker’s intentions when presented with a designed trigger (e.g., backdoor attacks) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
A common defense strategy against poisoning attacks involves robust aggregation protocols capable of detecting and filtering malicious updates.
However, this detection and filtering strategy relies on the assumption that malicious updates can be distinguished from benign ones—an assumption that may not hold in cases where participant data distribution varies significantly.
As benign updates also diverge, separating malicious updates becomes more challenging. Moreover, a malicious participant might adapt their local training procedure to make their updates indistinguishable from benign ones.
Therefore, defending against poisoning attacks necessitates a strategy that can validate local models to effectively detect and filter malicious updates.
Conversely, inference attacks can be initiated by inverting gradients to reconstruct client’s training data from individual model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges:</span> Although some existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> assume server’s access to clean data for local model validation, such assumptions are often impractical—especially in privacy sensitive FL applications.
Hence, implementing a validation strategy introduces two challenges: how to obtain the validation data and how to perform validation without exposing the local models.
The validation data should be representative of the participants’ training data. In practice, any dataset collected by the server may not sufficiently represent the diverse distribution of clients’ data.
One naive solution is selecting a set of clients as validators from the pool of all clients and using their data for validation of local models. However, sending local models to validators risks exposing them to gradient inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.
Another alternate approach is to validate the global model instead and accepting or rejecting the global model based on the validation performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
However, the averaged global model could be infected at each round and fail the validation test resulting in a denial-of-service.
Hence, neither local nor global models are ideal for validation.
We name this challenge as <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">validation subject dilemma</span>.
Additionally, using unvetted FL participants as validators raises concerns as malicious validators can send false results, a challenge we refer to as the <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">validation integrity dilemma</span>.
These dilemmas present significant obstacles in employing validation as a defense strategy against poisoning attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Proposed defense:</span>
In this paper, we propose a novel validation-based defense framework against poisoning attacks,
<span id="S1.p5.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>,
that is able to simultaneously solve the validation subject and validation integrity dilemmas in different FL setups.
The proposed strategy solves the validation subject dilemma by using
<span id="S1.p5.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">representative models</span>, which are crafted using multiple local models to ensure that the inference attack will be ineffective.
Each representative model is then validated, and based on the validation results, the local models that contributed to the best representative models are selected.
We propose two versions of <span id="S1.p5.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> based on two representative model crafting algorithms: one with the use of
<em id="S1.p5.2.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clustering</em>
and the other with a scheme that we refer to as
<em id="S1.p5.2.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bijective</em> model generation.
The version that uses clustering-based algorithm is referred to as <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield<sup id="S1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S1.p5.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_serif ltx_font_italic">∗</span></sup></span> and the version that uses bijective representatives is referred to as <span id="S1.p5.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield<sup id="S1.p5.2.2.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S1.p5.2.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_serif ltx_font_italic">†</span></sup></span>.
Our framework also suggests which strategy to use based on the number of participants and the level of robustness required in the system.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We solve the validation integrity dilemma by using a validation protocol that uses a new metric that we refer to as

This metric can be applied to any classifier validation process in an FL system.

Additionally, we demonstrate that the LIPC scores evaluated by the benign validators on representative models are consistent even in a non-IID scenario.
We use a validation filtering mechanism in <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> to filter tailored validation results by malicious validators and solve the validation integrity dilemma.</p>

We further show that the filtering technique of <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> enables it to defend against both untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks.
Different poisoning techniques, such as data poisoning or model poisoning, are equally ineffective because of the framework’s focus on validating models before aggregating them.

This is a subclass of targeted poisoning attacks where the adversary manipulates the global model to misclassify samples from a specific class (i.e., source class) to a predetermined poison class (i.e., target class) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
For these attacks, the adversary aims at two metrics: minimizing global model’s recall (RCL) on source class and maximizing the attack success rate (ASR) which measures successful misclassification to the target class:</span></p>

We assume that the adversary compromises a subset of the clients through Sybil attacks by creating multiple fake clients to gain control over the FL system.
The Sybils have data sampled from the same distribution as the benign clients and they are coordinated by the adversary.
Each Sybil leaves as soon as it performs the attack, and then a new Sybil is created.
We assume that the FL coordinating server is honest.

</span>
To achieve the poisoning objective, the adversary launches a targeted/untargeted poisoning attack, and the success is measured using metrics ASR/BA (targeted) or MA (untargeted).
The adversary aims to reconstruct the clients’ training data by launching a gradient inversion attack on model updates.
Generally, the adversary has access to only global model updates. However, according to the design of <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>, when Sybils are selected as validators in a round, the adversary also gets access to the representative model updates.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the ML domain, validation is the process of verifying a model’s potential efficacy in the test phase by evaluating its performance on a validation dataset.
In centralized learning, this set is typically a portion of the training dataset not utilized for training.
Contrarily, in the context of FL, the participating clients are the data sources. Hence, a naive approach in FL could be using a portion of clients’ data for validation.
However, privacy concerns that led the invention of FL prevent the server from directly accessing clients’ data. Although some existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> assume server’s access to clean data, such assumptions are often impractical—especially in privacy sensitive FL applications.
Thus, the server must resort to the clients for validation of models.
Now, resorting to clients could be insecure as malicious clients can submit falsified validation results to the server and disrupt the validation process.
An effective defense mechanism must be able to discern genuine validation results from fraudulent ones. Moreover, malicious validator clients can attempt inference attacks on models received for validation—further complicating the challenges faced by <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>. Hence, <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>’s validation mechanism should only transmit models to validators that are not vulnerable to inference attacks. Addressing these two primary challenges is crucial for ensuring an effective defense.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address this dilemma, we introduce the concept of representative models which are fusions of multiple local model updates.
We utilize two strategies to generate such representative models:

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By aggregating local model updates trained on the datasets of multiple clients, representative models yield more generalized results and are thus more suitable for validation.
The integration of multiple local updates also thwarts privacy attacks launched by adversary-controlled malicious validators as it prevents successful reconstruction of training data.
We perform gradient inversion attack on these representative models and observe that these attacks are unsuccessful in reconstructing any image resembling the clients’ training data (details later in section <a href="#S6.SS5" title="6.5 Gradient Inversion Attack ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.5</span></a>).

Sibling contribution is incorporated into the representative model to enhance its generalizability.
This is because individual models trained on client-specific data subsets have weaker generalization than representative models which are composed of models trained on multiple clients’ datasets.
However, for <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.7.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> to mount a successful defense, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the sibling contribution need to be balanced to ensure the representative models achieve sufficient generalization without compromising the preeminent role of the base model, and (2) the benign representative model must contain a lesser proportion of contribution from malicious updates compared to those originating from other benign updates.

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The technique for generating cluster representative models consists of two steps: (1) dynamically clustering clients based on their model updates, and (2) averaging the updates within each cluster to create a representative model.
Existing defenses claim that benign and malicious clients can be separated by clustering on the model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
However, in non-IID scenarios, distinguishing them becomes challenging as data distribution shifts can cause benign model updates to seem more divergent than malicious ones.
Despite this, we recognize the value of clustering as a useful tool.
The non-IID data prevalent among FL clients necessitates a clustering algorithm that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters.
The dynamic clustering coupled with a quality evaluation metric is expected to group clients in a way that minimizes the intermingling of benign and malicious updates.
The veracity of the aforementioned claim is evidenced by experimental findings presented later in section <a href="#S6.SS4.SSS4" title="6.4.4 Explanation of Design Choices ‣ 6.4 Ablation Study ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4.4</span></a>.
This fact holds significance as it suggests that we can distinguish benign from malicious representative models during validation, presuming benign representative models surpass malicious ones in performance.
Consequently, the combination of clustering and validation mechanisms not only aids in the separation of benign and malicious clients but also ensures that the selected representative models contribute positively to the global model—enhancing its overall performance and robustness against attacks.
The specifics of our clustering algorithm along with its associated hyperparameters are discussed in detail in section <a href="#S5.SS1.SSS2" title="5.1.2 Cluster Representative Model Generator ‣ 5.1 Representative Model Generator ‣ 5 Design and Implementation of FLShield ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1.2</span></a>.</p>

FL systems host hundreds to tens of thousands of participants.
Bijective representative model generation, while computationally demanding, ensures individual evaluation, making it apt for smaller systems.
Conversely, the clustering-based approach, offering higher performance throughput, may blend benign and malicious updates in smaller cohorts, thus proving more suitable for larger systems.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>, local clients act as validators for representative models, assess them and report validation results to the server.
Nevertheless, verifying the integrity of these validation results is challenging.
Variations in data distribution among clients could lead to different validation outcomes from different benign validators for the same representative model—making the identification of false results based on discrepancies from true results potentially challenging.
Therefore, we introduce a new validation metric, loss impact per class (LIPC), which is computed class-wise to reduce the influence of diverse data distributions on validation results.
Our experiments reveal that employing LIPC in the validation process causes honest validation results to be more consistent with each other (section <a href="#S6.SS4.SSS2" title="6.4.2 How does FLShield differentiate malicious validation reports from benign ones? ‣ 6.4 Ablation Study ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4.2</span></a>).

We introduce label skew and feature skew in validators’ validation data (section <a href="#S6.SS2" title="6.2 Performance of FLShield ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.2</span></a>) as well as vary false validation result injection strategies (section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="6.3 FLShield-aware Attacks by Malicious Validators ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.3</span></a>).
In all cases, use of LIPC enabled <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> to detect false validation results effectively.
Moreover, using LIPC leads to the best performance amongst the metrics we consider later in section <a href="#S6.SS4.SSS2" title="6.4.2 How does FLShield differentiate malicious validation reports from benign ones? ‣ 6.4 Ablation Study ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4.2</span></a>.
These experiments substantiate the robustness and efficacy of our proposed validation approach.</p>

We conduct experiments with four datasets: F-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, E-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and LOAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The first three pertain to the image domain while the last one represents tabular data.
More details of the datasets are presented in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS1.SSS1" title="A.1.1 Datasets ‣ A.1 Details of Experiment Setup ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.1.1</span></a>.</p>

We evaluate <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> against three categories of attacks: poisoning attacks, privacy inference attacks, and attacks that are specifically designed against <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>.
The poisoning attacks include both untargeted (i.e., inner product manipulation attack or IPMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>) and targeted (i.e., targeted label flipping attack or TLFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and backdoor) ones.
Further, we consider three backdoor attacks: distributed backdoor attack (DBA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, edge-case backdoor attack (ECBA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and semantic backdoor attack (SBA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
We also consider a gradient inversion attack (GIA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to evaluate if the representative models used in <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> can be used by the malicious validators to reconstruct training data from other clients.
As mentioned earlier, we design <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>-aware attacks where malicious participants attempt to compromise the integrity of the validation process.
We design two such attacks: FLShield-aware adaptive attack (FA-Adp) and FLShield-aware advanced attack (FA-Adv).

Even though FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> has been designed to detect targeted attacks (more specifically, backdoor attacks), it does not perform well against TLFA.

This is interesting since the validators are picked from the non-IID client groups as well.
More specifically, this result shows that the validation mechanism of <span id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> does not require the validators to be IID.

However, it is important to note that finding a set of crafted validation results that meet both objectives could be difficult for the adversary. This is because, for example, malicious representative models able to poison the FL system may not be stealthy.
If these objectives cannot be achieved simultaneously, we can conclude that any attack that is aware of <span id="S6.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> would still fail to poison the FL system. We design two enhanced adversaries to meet these two objectives at the same time:</p>

In this approach, the adversary tries to achieve the two objectives through the formulation of an optimization problem. Such adaptive attacks have been designed to prove the effectiveness of other defenses in the literature, e.g., in FLTrust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In this tactic, we define a loss function combining the two objectives.

Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 6.3 FLShield-aware Attacks by Malicious Validators ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ FLShield: A Validation Based Federated Learning Framework to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> compares the performance of <span id="S6.SS3.p4.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> against FA-Adp and FA-Adv attacks including the case when there is no malicious validator.
In the no malicious validator scenario, when a malicious participant is selected as a validator it does not manipulate the validation results.
The attacks in this experiment are performed on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The results show that both versions of <span id="S6.SS3.p4.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>-aware attacks achieve limited success in terms of RCL, BA, TPR, and TNR. The only anomaly is the performance of <span id="S6.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield<sup id="S6.SS3.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S6.SS3.p4.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_serif ltx_font_italic">∗</span></sup></span> against the FA-Adv attack that reduces TPR and TNR by  10% under DBA.

DBA exhibits a smaller benign-malicious model gap compared to TLFA.
FA-Adv’s strategy, aiming to narrow this gap, only finds limited success when minimum alterations don’t yield out-of-distribution <math id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒩</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1.1">𝒩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p4.3.m2.1c">\mathcal{N}</annotation></semantics></math>.
However, such occurrences are rare, and the limited infiltration is inadequate for an effective backdoor.
<span id="S6.SS3.p4.3.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">
The recall is higher in some defense-aware attack scenarios compared to non-defense-aware ones.
However, recall is not a robust metric for evaluating the defense’s effectiveness due to various influencing factors in an FL system.
Differences in benign model updates selected in cases like None and FA-Adp or FA-Adv lead to different recall values, even if they are close.
TPR/TNR, in contrast, serves as a direct measure of the defense’s ability to eliminate poisoned model updates.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data Poisoning Attack against FL</span>.
Data poisoning is an adversarial attack that manipulating training datasets by injecting poisoned data to control the behavior of the trained model. This attack have been demonstrated to be successful on many machine learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
FL is also vulnerable to data poisoning. In FL, this attack involve maliciously manipulating or poisoning the data contributed by specific clients in order to compromise the overall model’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Depending on the attacker’s goal, this kind of attacks can be categorized into untargeted attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and targeted attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Untargeted attacks aim to make the learned model unusable by degrading the performance of the model, while targeted attacks only influence the model’s behavior towards misclassifying certain target inputs.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Robust Aggregation Frameworks</span>.
A number of robust FL aggregation frameworks have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to mitigate the threat of Byzantine participants. There are mainly two categories of methods: (1) identifying and filtering out malicious clients, and (2) adding noise to local updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Identifying and filtering out malicious clients is a commonly employed method. Some methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> mitigate malicious clients by removing local updates which are far away from the majority. However, these methods are highly sensitive to outliers in the client updates and may exclude benign clients with significantly different updates.  FLTrust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which makes the assumption that the defender has access to a server-side clean dataset, leverages cosine similarity to identify malicious intent in client updates deviating from a benign server model. However, the challenge lies in assembling such a clean dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Certain methods allow clients to act as validators to detect malicious updates. Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> propose assessing the integrity of local models using client’s local data, marking poorly performing models as malicious, but this method is unable to detect targeted attacks that don’t diminish the overall performance of the model. BaFFLe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> lets selected clients to validate the aggregated model but also shares the same problem.</p>

<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have introduced many novel statistical techniques to identify abnormal updates. FLDetector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> let the server predict local model updates based on the historical updates and then identify the malicious updates by comparing the predicted updates and the received updates. However, it is not necessary for the malicious clients to keep changing their local data distribution. Deepsight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> remove the local updates that trained with datasets where a single class dominates the majority of the labels by estimating distribution of clients’ local data. Nevertheless, it’s easy for an attacker to construct a training set to make the malicious clients evade the detection and the benign clients who only have homogeneous data will suffer from bad model performance. Adding noise to local updates have been explored as a potential option <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> but the noise injection causes utility loss to the trained model.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One limitation of <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> is that it has been designed to work in FL systems with a classification task.
The extension of <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>’s validation mechanism to other tasks, e.g., text generation and recommendation systems seem challenging.
It remains a future work to investigate how the insights gained from <span id="S8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> could be used in those tasks.
In <span id="S8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span>, all model updates selected post-validation receive equal weight, despite their respective scores.
We did not integrate an adaptive weighting scheme that might assign a higher weight to models achieving better validation scores.
Although this has not resulted performance drop in terms of any metric, investigating alternative schemes may be advantageous for an FL system that uses an incentive mechanism to stimulate the provision of high-quality data.
Nevertheless, we leave this exploration as a future work.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a novel validation-based defense framework for Federated Learning (FL) <span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> which is adept at resolving the <em id="S9.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">validation dilemmas</em> without creating any system vulnerabilities and exhibits robustness against three types of poisoning attacks.
Further, <span id="S9.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLShield</span> can efficiently defend against two defense-aware attacks, specifically, FA-Adp and FA-Adv.
We also perform gradient inversion attack experiments, demonstrating that malicious validators are incapable of reconstructing training data from the shared representative models.
This design aligns well with existing privacy precautions against inference attacks.
We demonstrate that employing a validation process is the sole reliable defense strategy against poisoning attacks in FL.
Despite our framework being tailored for training classifiers, we anticipate its potential extension to other machine learning tasks, an area we earmark for future research.</p>

This attack aims to misclassify a specific class of samples (<em id="A1.SS1.SSS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">source</em> class) to another class (<em id="A1.SS1.SSS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target</em> class).
The malicious clients flip the labels of the samples from the source class to the target class in their local dataset and train the malicious local model.
The (source, target) class pairs for the datasets F-MNIST, E-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and LOAN are (coat, shirt), (digit 5, digit 3), (automobile, truck), and (current, charged off) respectively.</p>

In this attack, the adversary split the trigger pattern into multiple parts, and each client injects one of the partial triggers into a fraction of their training samples.
For our experiments, we use the same trigger pattern as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, and we split the trigger pattern into 4 parts.
The target class for the datasets F-MNIST, E-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and LOAN are pullover, digit 2, bird, and ’Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Charged Off’ respectively.</p>

Edge-case backdoors are generated by altering label data points that, while usually correctly classified by the model, are under-represented, or unlikely to be part of the regular training or test data.
We followed the experimental setup of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
The adversary uses images of the planes class from Southwest Airlines as edge-case samples and labels them as truck.</p>

We followed the experiment setup of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and conduct the image classification task on CIFAR dataset.
We selected the green car images as backdoor and labeled them as bird.</p>

We implement the attack proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
The attack necessitates a smaller batch size for success, thus we utilize a batch of 16.
We optimize the attack for 5,000 iterations using Adam, with an initial learning rate of 0.1.</p>

DP ensures privacy by adding noise to local updates but can compromise the model’s performance if too much noise is added. Homomorphic encryption allows the central server to compute encrypted data, but its practical application is limited by substantial computational overhead. SMC enables global model updates with aggregated local updates but is only effective when participants are honest.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.

Inspired by FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we utilize secure two-party computation (STPC) to prevent the threat from malicious central server. The overhead on the runtime caused by STPC is acceptable given it can help maintain privacy.
<br class="ltx_break">The idea is to prevent access to all local updates by a single central server. In order to achieve this goal, a third-party server called External Server is introduced.

This division of data allows both servers to possess partial access to the local updates. Once the central server and the external server receive the partial updates, they can employ STPC to collaboratively generate a representative model and send the generated model to the validators. Last, the servers can clip the local updates based on the output of the validators and update the global model together via STPC.</p>
