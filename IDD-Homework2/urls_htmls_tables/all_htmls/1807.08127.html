<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the problem of joint power and resource allocation (JPRA) for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks is studied.
Therein, the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) is minimized subject to high reliability in terms of probabilistic queuing delays.
Using extreme value theory, a new reliability measure is defined to characterize extreme events pertaining to vehicles’ queue lengths exceeding a predefined threshold.
To learn these extreme events,
assuming they are independently and identically distributed over VUEs,
a novel distributed approach based on federated learning (FL) is proposed to estimate the tail distribution of the queue lengths.
Considering the communication delays incurred by FL over wireless links, Lyapunov optimization is used to derive the JPRA policies enabling URLLC for each VUE in a distributed manner.
The proposed solution is then validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model.
Simulation results show that FL enables the proposed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues with an accuracy that is close to a centralized solution with up to 79% reductions in the amount of exchanged data.
Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60% reductions of VUEs with large queue lengths, while reducing the average power consumption by two folds, compared to an average queue-based baseline.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Providing efficient vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is a necessary stepping stone for enabling autonomous and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
V2V communications can extend drivers’ field of view, thus enhancing traffic safety and driving experience, while enabling new transportation features such as platooning, real-time navigation, collision avoidance, and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
However, the performance of emerging transportation applications heavily rely on the availability of V2V communication links with extremely low errors and delays.
In this regard, achieving ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for V2V networks is necessary for realizing the vision of intelligent transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The modeling of URLLC has focused on different system design aspects such as guaranteeing the signal-to-interference ratio, data rate, over-the-air/queuing latency, connectivity, age-of-information (AoI), and decoding probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Since over-the-air latency and queuing latency are coupled, ensuring low queuing latency is required to achieve the much coveted target end-to-end latency of 1 ms.
This, in turn, necessitates efficient radio resource management (RRM) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, the increased energy consumption and its negative impact on the environment due to the large number of vehicles in modern transportation system, and improving energy-efficiency/energy savings need to be addressed within RRM in V2V communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several existing RRM techniques have been proposed for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency vehicular communications while factoring in several challenges such as rate maximization, delay minimization, improving energy-efficiency, energy saving, and vehicle clustering/platooning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the performance of vehicular platooning is optimized while jointly considering the delay of the wireless network and the stability of the vehicle’s control system.
By grouping vehicles into clusters, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> minimizes the total transmission power in a vehicular network while considering queuing latency and reliability.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed for cooperative V2V communication systems.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed an energy saving sleep mode strategy for access points serving motorway vehicular traffic.
The problem of vehicle network clustering is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to reduce the power consumption of V2V communications.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a joint resource allocation and power control algorithm is proposed to maximize the V2V sum rate.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> optimize the beam alignment and scheduling among vehicles to reduce the V2V communication delays.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the tradeoff between service delay and transmission success in V2V communications is optimized.
The URLLC aspects of this prior art <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> are captured by either improving the average latencies or imposing a probabilistic constraint to maintain small queue lengths.
Although such a probabilistic constraint on the queue length improves network reliability, it fails to control rare events in which large queue lengths occur with low probability, i.e., the tail distribution of queue lengths.
As a result, if the network relies on these existing schemes, some of the vehicular users (VUEs) may experience unacceptable latencies yielding degraded performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, to enable a truly URLLC experience, it is imperative to model and capture extreme, low probability events.
To this end, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">extreme value theory</em> (EVT), a powerful tool from statistics that characterizes the occurrences of extreme, low probability events instrumental in enabling URLLC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, EVT is used to model the distributions of data rates exceeding a threshold for few traffic traces and then, the accuracy of the analytical model is evaluated using simulations.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> studies the statistical distributions of inter-beacon delays in safety applications for vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) using EVT.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> use EVT to model the peak distribution of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing envelope while characterizing the variations in peak-to-average-power ratios.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> employs EVT to characterize the statistics of maximal queue length so as to control the worst-case latency of V2V communication links therein.
Characterizing the distribution of extreme events using EVT, i.e., determining the location, shape, and scale parameters of the tail distribution, in the above works necessitates the acquisition of sufficient samples capturing extreme events.
Depending on the network size and the quality of the communication within the network, the process of gathering samples over the network may introduce unacceptable overheads that are not investigated in the aforementioned works.
In a real-time system such as a V2V communication network, VUEs may have access to limited number of queue length samples (particularly those that are locally in excess over a high threshold) and hence they are unable to estimate the tail distribution of the network-wide queue lengths.
Therefore, roadside units (RSUs) can assist in gathering samples over the network at a cost of additional data exchange overheads.
Furthermore, due to the resource limitations available for V2V communication, VUEs may be unwilling to allocate their resources to share their individual queue state information (QSI) with an RSU and other VUEs.
This shortcoming warrants a collaborative learning model that does not rely on sharing individual QSI.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) was proposed as a decentralized learning technique where training data is distributed (possibly unevenly) across learners, instead of being centralized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
FL allows each learner to derive a set of local learning parameters from the available training data, referred to as <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local model</em>.
Instead of sharing the training data, learners share their local models with a central entity, which in turn does model averaging then sharing a <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global model</em> with the learners.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the applicability of several existing algorithms for FL are studied and a novel algorithm is proposed to handle the sparse data available at individual learners.
The means of minimizing the communication cost by sharing a reduced number of parameters of FL models are discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, FL is used to develop distributed learning models for multiple related tasks simultaneously, referred to as multi-task learning.
The recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, proposes a new FL protocol that solves a client selection problem with resource constraints in mobile edge computing. Our prior work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> proposes a distributed FL-based algorithm for VUEs based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
However, this prior work does not consider sharing wireless resources for FL and V2V communications, whereby the impact of FL over shared wireless resources on V2V URLLC is not investigated.
To the best of our knowledge, with the exception of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, no work has studied the use of federated learning in the context of URLLC.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.3" class="ltx_p">The main contribution of this paper is to propose a distributed, FL-based, joint transmit power and resource allocation framework for enabling ultra-reliable and low-latency vehicular communication.
We formulate a network-wide power minimization problem while ensuring low latency and high reliability in terms of probabilistic queue lengths.
To model reliability, we first obtain the statistics of the queue lengths exceeding a high threshold by using the EVT notion of a <em id="S1.p5.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">generalized Pareto distribution</em> (GPD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Using the statistics of the GPD, we impose a local constraint on extreme events pertaining to queue lengths exceeding a predefined threshold for each VUE.
Here, the characteristic parameters of the GPD are known as scale and shape, which are obtained by using the MLE.
In contrast to the classical MLE design which requires a central controller (e.g., RSU) to collect samples of queue lengths exceeding a threshold from all VUEs in the network, using FL every vehicle builds and shares its own local model (two gradient values) with the RSU.
The RSU aggregates the local models, does model averaging across vehicles, and feeds back the global model to VUEs.
Leveraging different time scales, using our proposed approach, each VUE learns its GPD parameters locally in a short time scale while the model averaging (global learning) takes place in a longer time scale.
Here, an assumption of independently and identically distributed queue length samples exceeding the threshold over all VUEs is imposed to ensure accurate GPD parameter estimation using FL.
In our model, we take into account the communication overheads of URLLC due to the model exchange over shared wireless resources.
Then, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows all VUEs to simultaneously learn the GPD parameters using FL.
To further reduce the overhead due to the need of synchronization and simultaneous model sharing, next we develop an asynchronous FL algorithm for MLE that allows VUEs to model and independently learn the tail distribution of queue lengths in a distributed manner.
Finally, Lyapunov optimization is used to decouple and solve the network-wide optimization problem per VUE.
Simulation results show that the proposed solutions estimate the GPD parameters very accurately compared to a centralized learning module and yields significant gains in terms of reducing the number of VUEs with large queue lengths while minimizing power consumption.
For dense systems with 100 VUE pairs, the proposed solution yields about <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="60.9\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">60.9</mn><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2">60.9</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">60.9\%</annotation></semantics></math> reduction of VUEs with large queue lengths by reducing the power consumption by two folds, compared to a baseline model that controls the reliability using a probabilistic constraint on average queue lengths.

<p id="S2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">The number of vehicles is expected to grow continuously, in which improving energy efficiency and saving energy in vehicular networks is a key requirement.
Our goal is therefore to minimize the network-wide power consumption while ensuring URLLC.
Considering use cases such as information exchange on blind-spots or sequences of future actions (turning, parking, slowing/speeding) based on the traffic ahead, it is important to optimize decision making taking into account the queue length and its tail distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In this view,
here, reliability is achieved by guaranteeing queue stability for each vTx while keeping outages below a predefined threshold, i.e., the probability that the queue length exceeding a threshold <math id="S2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{0}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">q</mi><mn id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑞</ci><cn type="integer" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1c">q_{0}</annotation></semantics></math> is below a certain probability <math id="S2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CEN</span>, all VUEs in the network need to frequently upload their local queue length samples to the RSU by reusing the RBs available for V2V communication.
This sample uploading over wireless links introduces an additional overhead in which a significant performance degradation can be expected in URLLC.
As the VUE density increases, the sample size grows and so does VUEs’ access to the RSU causing congestion resulting in increased network latency.
Henceforth, the need for a distributed learning technique for MLE that does not require sharing all the local samples at VUEs with the RSU or one another is crucial.</p>

Here, synchronization may improve the accuracy of the estimation of global gradients.
However, the simultaneous transmissions to the RSU by all VUEs degrades the VUE-RSU data rates and thus, introduces significant delays to ongoing V2V communication.
This synchronous FL approach presented above is dubbed “<span id="S4.SS3.p4.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">sync-FL</span>” hereinafter, and summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ IV-C FL-Based GPD Parameter Estimation ‣ IV Learning the Parameters of the Maximum Queue Distribution ‣ Distributed Federated Learning for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Vehicular Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In all three methods used to estimate the GPD parameters, <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CEN</span>, <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">sync-FL</span>, and <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">async-FL</span>, the QSI samples or local/global models are exchanged between VUEs and RSU by reusing the RBs available for V2V communication.
This communication between VUEs and the RSU for GPD parameter estimation introduces additional latencies to the ongoing V2V communication.
Such latencies from GPD parameter learning can be seen as additional costs for URLLC applications.
In this regard, modeling the cost of uploading/downloading the learning models or queue samples in terms of an additional delay on V2V communication is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-C FL-Based GPD Parameter Estimation ‣ IV Learning the Parameters of the Maximum Queue Distribution ‣ Distributed Federated Learning for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Vehicular Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and discussed next.</p>

From Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Centralized vs distributed GPD parameter estimation ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Distributed Federated Learning for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Vehicular Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a> it can be noted that the estimations of <span id="S5.SS1.p1.14.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">async-FL</span> are almost equivalent to the <span id="S5.SS1.p1.14.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CEN</span> estimations.
To evaluate the accuracy of GPD parameter estimation numerically, we use MLE-based cost function in (<a href="#S4.E17" title="In IV-B RSU-Centric GPD Parameter Estimation ‣ IV Learning the Parameters of the Maximum Queue Distribution ‣ Distributed Federated Learning for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Vehicular Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) and the corresponding results are illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Centralized vs distributed GPD parameter estimation ‣ V Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Distributed Federated Learning for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Vehicular Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>.

Increasing the number of iterations used in SVRGD reduces the cost rapidly at first, then the reductions are insignificant.
When two iterations are used for SVRGD, FL yields lower cost and thus, a higher accuracy in parameter estimation compared to <span id="S5.SS1.p1.14.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CEN</span>.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have formulated the problem of joint power control and resource allocation for V2V communication network as a network-wide power minimization problem subject to ultra reliability and low latency constraints.
The constraints in terms of URLLC are characterized using extreme value theory and modeled as the tail distribution of the network-wide queue lengths over a predefined threshold.
Leveraging concepts of federated learning, a distributed learning mechanism is proposed where VUEs estimate the tail distribution locally with the assistance of a RSU.
Here, FL enables VUEs to learn the tail distribution of the network-wide queues locally without sharing the actual queue length samples reducing unnecessary overheads.
Combining both EVT and FL approaches, we have proposed a Lyapunov-based distributed transmit power and resource allocation procedure for VUEs.
Using simulations, we have shown that the proposed method learns the statistics of the network-wide queues with high accuracy.
Furthermore, the proposed method shows considerable gains in reducing extreme events where the queue lengths grow beyond a predefined threshold compared to systems that account for reliability by imposing probabilistic constraints on the average queue lengths.
It is worth noting that the accuracy of FL-based tail distribution modeling relies on the assumption of IID queue length samples.
In this regard, a future extension of this work is to study
FL in the presence of non-IID training data.</p>
