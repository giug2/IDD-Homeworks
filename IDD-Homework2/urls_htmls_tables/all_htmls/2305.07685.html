<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Access to individual-level health data is essential for gaining new insights and advancing science. In particular, modern methods based on artificial intelligence rely on the availability of and access to large datasets. In the health sector, access to individual-level data is often challenging due to privacy concerns. A promising alternative is the generation of fully synthetic data, i.e. data generated through a randomised process that have similar statistical properties as the original data, but do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the original individual-level records. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art synthetic data generation method and perform in-depth quality analyses of the generated data for a specific use case in the field of nutrition. We demonstrate the need for careful analyses of synthetic data that go beyond descriptive statistics and provide valuable insights into how to realise the full potential of synthetic datasets. By extending the methods, but also by thoroughly analysing the effects of sampling from a trained model, we are able to largely reproduce significant real-world analysis results in the chosen use case.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In biomedical research, scientific progress is often limited by the availability and quality of data. The results of any study can only be as good as the data on which the statistical analysis was based. Additionally, machine learning methods - including deep learning - are completely dependent on the quality and amount of the available training data. For some application fields it is extremely hard to obtain enough data to be able to draw any conclusions, for example in the case of rare diseases. In particular, to realise the full potential of deep learning methods, the amount of data should be larger than for more traditional machine learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To increase availability of medical data, a legally compliant mechanism for sharing it between different institutions is needed. Furthermore, being able to share the data used in a publication is an important step in making its results reproducible in terms of the FAIR principles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, the storage, processing, and sharing of individual-level health data is tightly regulated and restricted by law, as health-related data are generally considered to be highly sensitive (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> Art. 9).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sharing personal health data in compliance with laws and regulations, such as the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), usually requires informed consent. However, this is often not feasible, for example if data is to be analysed retrospectively at a large scale. As an alternative, data can be anonymised in such a way that it cannot be traced back to specific individuals anymore. This typically requires significant modifications, e.g. by removing direct identifiers (such as names), and by coarsening indirect identifiers (such as age or geographic region). And this approach inevitably requires balancing the reduction of risks achieved through the removal of information with associated reductions in the utility of the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This also means that a complete anonymisation might not always be possible to achieve for many types of data, with genetic information being a common example.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An alternative way to share data could be to use synthetic data generation methods that have been proven efficient in the past, e.g. by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this process, instead of modifying the original data to make them harder to re-identify, a completely new dataset is created, ideally with similar statistical properties as the real life data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we apply and adapt state-of-the-art algorithms to generate synthetic data for a defined use case, for which several downstream analyses have already been performed on the real data and their results have been published.
In addition to analysing summary statistics of the dataset, this gives us the opportunity to gain deep insights into the possibilities and limitations of synthetic data in the specific use case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The original data that are used are parts of the data collected within the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Dortmund nutritional and anthropometric longitudinally designed (DONALD) study</span>, which is an ongoing nutritional cohort study capturing information about the diet and health of children in Dortmund, Germany since 1985 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Participants are recruited as newborns, and then accompanied until young adulthood to get a holistic picture of their developing health and the dietary factors that influence it. The subset used during this study includes dietary data with focus on sugar intake based on all dietary records of participants aged three through 18 years between 1985 and 2016. The resulting dataset consists of structured health data, where the same 33 variables have been recorded over fixed yearly intervals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The data collected by the DONALD study have already been used for several nutritional studies, such as the recent analysis of sugar intake time trends by Perrar <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which was performed on the same subset used for this work. Hence, this subset, that will from now on only be called DONALD data, has the following properties that need to be taken into account when searching an appropriate synthetic data generation method: It is longitudinal, because its data have been collected over a series of 16 visits. Additionally, it contains static variables that are only collected during the first visit. It is also heterogeneous, since its columns consist of various different data types. Finally, it is incomplete in terms of longitudinality, as not all participants attended each annual visit.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, a variety of different machine learning-based methods have been proposed to generate synthetic data, and we will discuss the following three classes that are commonly used (or combinations of them): probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Especially GANs, originally developed by Goodfellow <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, are currently used in a variety of generative tasks and have proven successful in the generation of realistic fake images and in producing natural text data (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>). However, GANs have been proposed for the generation of continuous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Choi <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> address this by combining a GAN with an autoencoder in their architecture, which has been pre-trained to compress and reconstruct the original data. The resulting model, MedGAN, learns to generate EHRs. It provides an attractive solution to the generation of convincing electronic health records with continuous, binary and count features. Unfortunately, it cannot be used for the generation of DONALD data, since it is not able to generate longitudinal data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">An alternative for longitudinal data has been developed by Esteban <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, who propose two different models (RGAN and RCGAN), both based on recurrent neural networks, to produce real-valued time series data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Even though the model is able to learn longitudinality, it cannot cope with heterogeneous data types, as well as a mixture of static and longitudinal variables that are typical in clinical studies. A further alternative is timeGAN, another GAN-based method that learns an embedding to represent longitudinal data in a lower dimensional space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, timeGAN is unable to generate static covariates and has not been applied to the medical domain yet – hence, data incompleteness would potentially cause problems that require further work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Another promising method is called Variational Autoencoder Modular Bayesian Network (VAMBN), which has been, indeed, designed to generate fully synthetic data for mixed static and longitudinal datasets containing heterogeneous features with missing values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To achieve this, a Heterogeneous-Incomplete Variational Autoencoder (HI-VAE) is combined with a Bayesian Network (BN). This works by splitting the data into modules, training a HI-VAE for each of them to produce encodings, and fitting the BN over all encodings of the modules. Longitudinality is handled by assigning the data of different visits to different modules. Due to its capabilities, VAMBN serves as a baseline algorithm for the present study.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the generative nature of the task – in contrast to discriminative tasks – the evaluation of the quality and usefulness of the data is not trivial, especially because it is performed on complex, heterogeneous health data. Different measures are used in different studies, probably due to different features having large variations in type and importance, which are highly dependent on the use case. Additionally, there is no standard terminology used by related studies. In this paper, we will follow the terminology from Georges-Filteau and Cirillo, who classify the metrics broadly into quantitative and qualitative metrics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Here, qualitative analysis is based on visual inspection of the results done by field experts. For example, in <span id="S1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">preference judgement</span>, given a pair of two data points – one real and one synthetic – the aim is to choose the most realistic one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. A similar method of this category is called <span id="S1.p10.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">discrimination task</span>, where the expert is shown one data point at a time and needs to decide whether it is realistic or not. However, according to Borji, qualitative methods that are based on visual inspections are weak indicators and quantitative measures offer more convincing proofs of data quality at the dataset or sample level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. 
<br class="ltx_break">Georges-Filteau and Cirillo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> further classify three subcategories of quantitative measures: comparisons between real and synthetic data on dataset level, comparisons of individual feature distributions, and utility metrics, which indicate whether the synthetic data can be used for real world analyses that were planned or already performed on the real dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">Assessing the privacy of the data may be an even more difficult task, and is also handled differently in related works. While in some studies the risk of re-identification is assessed or controlled using empirical analyses (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>), another established method known as <span id="S1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">differential privacy</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> can provide theoretical probabilistic bounds for various types of privacy risks. This method has been adapted to the area of deep learning by adding a specified amount of noise during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Differential privacy can be integrated into all algorithms presented in this study. While acknowledging the importance of a more careful analysis of the privacy risks associated with synthetic data, we would like to point out that this is in practice a rather complex task, which we see out of the scope of this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">In the present study, we make the following contributions: We apply the state-of-the-art algorithm VAMBN to generate synthetic data based on the DONALD dataset – a dataset from a nutritional cohort study. We extend VAMBN with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to more effectively encode longitudinal parts of the data and show a significant increase in the ability to reproduce direct dependencies across time points. We evaluate our generated synthetic data on four different levels and show that while descriptive summary statistics and individual variable distributions can be efficiently reproduced with all chosen methods, direct dependencies can only be reproduced by our proposed extension. With this, we apply real-world experiments together with domain experts and gain valuable insights on how to exploit the potential of fully synthetic datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The method of the used DONALD dataset has been described in detail by Perrar <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The main content of the data for each record is the nutrient intake, e.g. fat or carbohydrate intake, as well as the intake of different types of sugars, measured as a percentage of the total daily energy intake in kilocalories per day (%E).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Across all available records from the 1,312 participants, the dataset spans the ages three through 18, containing 36 variables. The only non-longitudinal variables are a personal number to identify each individual (pers_ID), an identification number for each family (fam_ID), and the sex of the participant. So a complete participant record contains 530 variables (3 static + [16 visits × 33 longitudinal variables]). Note that some participants have not been part of the study for all 16 visits, for example because they are still under 18, and that some of the yearly visits may also have been skipped for unknown reasons. Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 DONALD Data ‣ 2 Material and Methods ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> explores the amount of missingness per participant and visit. Apart from missed visits, there is almost no missingness in the data. The only exceptions are two variables that describe the overweight status and the education level of the mother of the participants (<em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">m_ovw</em> and <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">m_schulab</em>), which have small amounts of missingness (1.25% and 0.17%, respectively). For missing values in the original analyses (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>), the respective median of the total sample was used (n = 38 for maternal overweightness, n = 5 for maternal educational status).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the application of VAMBN, the data need to be grouped into different modules. This has been initially done by experts and resulted in four modules for the DONALD data: Times (T), Nutrition (N), Anthropometric (A), and Socioeconomic (S). Over the study course, varying settings have been tested. An overview can be found in the Appendix in Table <a href="#Sx3.T2" title="Table A2 ‣ VAMBN Settings ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A2</span></a>. Moreover, for each setting, there are a few static variables – also called covariates – that are not grouped (i.e., the family number and the sex of the participant).</p>

To be able to apply the synthetic data generation methods to the DONALD data, the single rows of the dataset need to be mapped to the different visits based on the age of the participant. Thereby, we define 16 visits from zero to 15, where visit zero happens with the age of three and visit 15 with the age of 18, respectively. This results in a tabular format where each row corresponds to one single participant, including all different visits, so there are 530 columns. In this result, the degree of missingness becomes visible for every row.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As baseline model, we use a <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Variational Autoencoder Modular Bayesian Network</span>, short VAMBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which has been designed to generate fully synthetic data for longitudinal datasets containing heterogeneous features and missing values. To achieve this, a Heterogeneous-Incomplete Variational Autoencoder (HI-VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which is able to handle incomplete and heterogeneous data, is combined with a conditional Gaussian Bayesian Network (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. To apply VAMBN, the dataset is first split into modules, which are encoded by individually trained HI-VAE modules. Thereby, different variables of the dataset are grouped together based on context, preferably together with domain experts. For each module at each time point (i.e. visit), an HI-VAE is trained, learning a low dimensional Gaussian mixture model of the input data. The resulting embeddings (consisting of discrete as well as Gaussian variables) are then used as input for a <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Modular Bayesian Network</span> (MBN), learning dependencies between these modules. At this point, auxiliary variables are introduced as missingness indicators for entire visits. For structure learning, so-called black and white lists are employed that prevent or enforce certain edges, respectively, in order to constrain the space of admissible graph structures as much as possible. From this MBN, synthetic embeddings can be drawn, and subsequently decoded by their respective HI-VAE modules to produce the final synthetic data. We refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> for a more detailed and mathematically precise explanation.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">General idea</h5>

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A simple approach to enable VAMBN to learn correlations is placing the correlated variables in the same module, because then the HI-VAE can account for their dependencies on its own. But this is limited to correlations at one specific visit, as the same variable observed at different time points is split into separate HI-VAE modules. The resulting embeddings are subsequently modelled via the BN. However, depending on the quality of the HI-VAE embeddings, this separation may result in a weakening of the temporal correlation structure after data synthesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This is why in our proposed extension, all visits of each variable group are instead simultaneously encoded by one HI-VAE, which is extended by an LSTM encoder. As a result, longitudinal variables share one embedding, and thus the BN is only used to learn dependencies between the embeddings of all the different variable groups, standalone variables, and missingness indicators.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>Overview of the developed architecture. For all settings, the real-world data are pre-processed and then embeddings are learned by an variational autoencoder (HI-VAE). Afterwards, the embeddings of the different modules are fed into a modular Bayesian Network, from which we can sample new data (that need to be decoded again by the autoencoder to be human-readable). The three shown settings differ in the neural network structure of the autoencoder (specifically, the encoder). This reduces the complexity of the Bayesian Network. In setting 2, the structure of the feedforward network is changed in such a way that all visits per module are encoded together, i.e. learned in one model. In setting 2, the default feedforward network is then changed to an LSTM layer in order to better cope with longitudinal dependencies.</figcaption>

<br class="ltx_break">For the subsequent real-world analyses, we choose VAMBN-MT for all experiments, but additionally investigate the influence of varying module selections – dependent on the research question.

For each selection, we sample 1,312 and 10,000 participants, respectively. While we want the smaller dataset to resemble the original data as much as possible, we apply the previously described post-processing (such as inserting the same percentage of missingness). In addition, we investigate the difference when using a much larger dataset without any post-processing. For each experiment and sample size, we sample 100 synthetic datasets (from the same model). To prevent influencing the time trend with outliers, we omit time points that are larger than the maximum value observed in the original data (i.e. lie in the future). For each time point, to represent all 100 trend functions, we plot their means along with their 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles. 
<br class="ltx_break">For all performed experiments, we use the same black- and white lists and hyperparameter settings that can be found in the Appendix (see Table <a href="#Sx3.T3" title="Table A3 ‣ VAMBN Settings ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A3</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use correlations between variables as an indicator of the extent to which the properties and dependencies of the real data are represented in the synthetic data. We checked for dependencies both within the same visit and across different visits. In the heatmap representation of the Pearson correlation matrices between all variables of all visits (Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Correlations between Variables ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>), it can be seen that absolute correlation values are generally higher in the original data (Fig. <a href="#S3.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Correlations between Variables ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>). With VAMBN, we obtain significantly smaller pair-wise correlations than in the real data and get a relative error of 0.86. With the VAMBN-FT version, the error is reduced to 0.74 (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F5.sf3" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Correlations between Variables ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a>) and the best result is achieved with VAMBN-MT with an error of 0.70 (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F5.sf4" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Correlations between Variables ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(d)</span></a>). In general, also in the original data, correlations are higher between variables of the same module than between variables of different modules, which indicates a good module selection.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The chosen DONALD dataset contains several interesting direct dependencies, representing case-specific expert knowledge, that can be used to further judge the quality of the synthetic data by investigating whether these dependencies can be correctly reproduced. Therefore, we chose two of these: Firstly, the boolean variable <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">m_schulab</em>, indicating whether the participant’s mother has had 12 years of school education. In the original dataset, this variable mostly stays the same, and might increase from 0 to 1 if a participant’s mother receives further education during the study. Logically, the indicator never changes from 1 to 0, however.
In Figure <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we show the value of the graduation status over all 16 visits for 100 randomly chosen samples for each of the three experiments, respectively. It gets evident that the original VAMBN approach is not able to correctly reproduce dependencies across time, because the graduation status of the mother often changes back and forth which is not plausible (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(a)</span></a>). We see an improvement in the VAMBN-FT experiment (Fig. <a href="#S3.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>), which makes sense because here, the HI-VAE module receives all visits as one input, containing all variables involved in this dependency. But still, the result is not satisfactory. In contrast, only a few errors are left when using VAMBN-MT, as can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S3.F6.sf3" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(c)</span></a>.</p>

They are both given as positive real-numbered values and form the variable group times. Again, for all three experiments, their summary statistics seemed plausible for all visits: The age of synthetic participants was around the expected age, with some random variance. And the age of the study was commonly anywhere between 0 and 30 years – which is also plausible, since the study had always included children of any age over the course of its existence. When looking at an individual child over multiple visits however, the age of the study kept fluctuating, often even getting younger.

However, these observed improvements are limited to variables across different visits with direct mathematical relationships.

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The age trend can be reproduced very well by the synthetic data and we see the same progression. Whereas the added sugar increases from the beginning up to the age of 10, it slowly decreases again afterwards. It can be seen that the variance (indicated as confidence intervals by the error bar), gets higher with increasing age. This may be due to the fact that the data basis is more incomplete for older participants. Whereas the same trend can be seen by both module selection settings (i) and (ii), selection (ii) is able to reproduce approximately same values (i.e. in terms of amplitude). In this selection, the two dependent variables <em id="S3.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">age</em> and <em id="S3.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">added sugar</em> are learned together in one module.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to legitimate privacy concerns, access to personal health data is strictly regulated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, even for scientific purposes. However, the availability of data is fundamentally necessary for scientific progress. For deep learning methods to be successfully applied, it is also crucial that the available training datasets are sufficiently large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To satisfy both privacy and usability demands, a classic approach is to anonymise datasets, which reduces disclosure risks and may allow sharing of the data even without informed consent. But anonymisation can severely limit the utility of medium to high-dimensional data for statistical analyses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and there are still recent results proclaiming to be able to re-identify individuals from anonymised data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. For these reasons, fully synthetic data generation methods are explored as an alternative to anonymisation. Their idea is that generating and sharing synthetic data may offer a better compromise between privacy of the individuals who appeared in the original data set, and the usability of the shared data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A lot of research has been already performed in the area of synthetic data generation methods. Common applications are based on image, text or tabular data generation from various domains (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>). However, the heterogeneity, the incompleteness, and the longitudinality of the DONALD dataset complicate the construction of generative models that produce useful synthetic data, making the dataset particularly interesting for the development of new methods and their evaluation. Due to the challenging properties of the dataset, the majority of published methods are not suitable for the task at hand. Therefore, we chose VAMBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> as a baseline method that is indeed designed to handle longitudinal, heterogeneous, and incomplete datasets. It does so by combining HI-VAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, a generative model that can encode and reconstruct heterogeneous incomplete data, with a Bayesian Network.</p>

Moreover, VAMBN fails to learn use case specific direct dependencies over time, such as the graduation status of the mother of the participants or the linear correlation between the participant’s age and the time point of the study (see Figures <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and <a href="#S3.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 3.3 Direct Dependencies ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, we proposed an extension of VAMBN, called <em id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">VAMBN-Memorised Time points</em> (MT), that incorporates an LSTM network, which was designed to have a long short-term memory, i.e. to better cope with time dependencies within the data. In our extension, several visits of the same variable were modelled within one module instead of splitting them into different modules that are connected via the BN. Hence, this extension firstly requires each HI-VAE module to map the data for all visits of its variable group to a single encoding, which is a process assisted by the newly introduced LSTM layer. And secondly, the extension must be able to reconstruct all data points of all visits at once from the singular encoding, which is done in a manner that ensures that all dependencies can be learned. In order to judge the improvement from including the LSTM layer, we compared both baseline and VAMBN-MT to <em id="S4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">VAMBN-Flattened Time points</em> (FT), which also reframes the visits so that they are learned together, but only uses the default feedforward network in the HI-VAE encoder (see Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Architecture ‣ 2.2 Model ‣ 2 Material and Methods ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of pair-wise correlations between variables, VAMBN-MT clearly outperforms the two other approaches (Fig. <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.2 Correlations between Variables ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). Also the direct dependencies across visits (i.e. the education status of the mother and the linear relationship between <span id="S4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">time</span> and <span id="S4.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">age</span>) are greatly improved with VAMBN-MT. An essential part of the quality analysis of synthetic data is to test whether they can be used for real-world analyses. Therefore, we use VAMBN-MT to reproduce time and age trends for added sugar intake, as done by Perrar <span id="S4.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Here, we could successfully reproduce the age trend and approximate the time trend very well (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 3.4 Real-World Analyses ‣ 3 Results ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>). Because we realised that the real-world analyses can vary between different datasets that were sampled from the same model (which is not the case for the previous analyses), we systematically determined the the effect of sampling by means of drawing new samples from each model 100 times and varying the sample size by generating datasets of size 1,312 (=size of the original data) and 10,000 (with and without post-processing, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, we draw the following conclusions: Firstly, a larger dataset leads to more stable age and time trends that only differ in amplitude but not in the progression of the trend itself (compare Fig. <a href="#Sx3.F1" title="Figure A1 ‣ Real-world Analyses ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A1</span></a>). Larger datasets also show less variance (in terms of confidence intervals) (Fig. <a href="#Sx3.F2" title="Figure A2 ‣ Real-world Analyses ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A2</span></a>). Moreover, whereas analyses with a small dataset lead to statistically significant results only in 22%-70% of cases, we get 100% significance for the large datasets. In addition, we could show that the selection of the modules needs to be done in dependence to the research question because correlations are lost if variables are trained with separate autoencoders. Finally, we investigated the total sugar intake, that does not show statistically significant results in the real data for linear and quadratic time trends, and conclude that a non-significant trend cannot be reproduced with the synthetic data (see Figure <a href="#Sx3.F3" title="Figure A3 ‣ Real-world Analyses ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A3</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Altogether, we showed the importance of use case-specific evaluations incorporating expert knowledge, especially in terms of direct dependencies. With the real-world analyses, we got a demonstration of the usefulness of synthetic data and gained valuable insights into the effects of resampling and the chosen sample size, the selection of variables that need to be learned together, and the importance of the significance level of the real-world experiments.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we generated synthetic data for a longitudinal study from the nutritional domain and performed an in-depth quality analysis, going beyond summary statistics and individual variable distributions. As we realised restrictions in the reproduction of use case specific direct dependencies across time points of current state-of-the-art methods, we developed VAMBN-MT, an LSTM-based extension of VAMBN that outperforms the original approach and is even able to reproduce real-world analyses. We highlighted the drastic increase in synthetic data quality achieved by incorporating expert domain knowledge and choosing a sufficiently large sample size. We showed that the resulting synthetic data can be a valuable source for real-world analyses. As a next step in our research, we plan to investigate the privacy risks associated with the data generated by our model to gain further insights into the risk-utility trade-off provided and to ultimately unlock the potential benefits of using synthetic data.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#Sx3.T1" title="Table A1 ‣ DONALD Data ‣ Appendix ‣ Synthetic data generation for a longitudinal cohort study – Evaluation, method extension and reproduction of published data analysis results" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A1</span></a>, metadata for the DONALD dataset can be seen that are described in the following. Each participant gets a personal number – a randomly generated unique identifier. In addition, each participating family gets a randomly generated family number. A family consists of the mother, the father, the biological, the adoptive, and the foster children. The sex of each participant is noted as either male or female. For every three-day weighed dietary record, the age of the participant is noted together with the date of the dietary record. Thereby, a specific time variable is created for time trend analyses, where the first included record in this evaluation was considered the baseline time, i.e., time = 0. Therefore, time ranged between 0 and 31 years.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most variables describe the nutrient intake as a percentage of the total energy intake per day (%E/d). This total energy intake is also given, in kilocalories per day (kcal/d).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, a numerical value for the basal metabolic rate (BMR) is reported, which is the amount of calories that are burnt during rest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Another variable introduced is the boolean variable of underreporting. Thereby, the plausibility of the reported values is determined based on a comparison to standard value ranges according to Sichert-Heilert <span id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Two further measures are reported for each visit concerning the weight of the participant. The first one is the determination of obesity according to Cole <span id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (2000) and the other one is the well-known body mass index (BMI). Finally, socioeconomic factors are taken into account, consisting of the BMI of the mother of the participant, whether she is currently employed, and whether she completed her A-level (in German <span id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fachabitur</span> or <span id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Abitur</span> - corresponding to 12 years of school education). For every three-day weighed dietary record, the number of weekdays or weekend days was recorded as well (<span id="Sx3.SSx1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">wo_tage</span>).</p>
