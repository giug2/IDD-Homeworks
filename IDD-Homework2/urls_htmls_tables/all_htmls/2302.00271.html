<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging approach for collaboratively training semantic encoder/decoder models of semantic communication systems, without private user data leaving the devices.
Most existing studies on trustworthy FL aim to eliminate data poisoning threats that are produced by malicious clients, but in many cases, eliminating model poisoning attacks brought by fake servers is also an important objective. In this paper, a certificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL) framework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and server. In CATFL, each client verifies the server’s signature information before accepting the delivered global model to ensure that the global model is not delivered by false servers. On the contrary, the server also verifies the server’s signature information before accepting the delivered model updates to ensure that they are submitted by authorized clients. Compared to PKI-based methods, the CATFL can avoid too high certificate management overheads. Meanwhile, the anonymity of clients shields data poisoning attacks, while real-name registration may suffer from user-specific privacy leakage risks. Therefore, a pseudonym generation strategy is also presented in CATFL to achieve a trade-off between identity traceability and user anonymity, which is essential to conditionally prevent from user-specific privacy leakage. Theoretical security analysis and evaluation results validate the superiority of CATFL.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The 6G communication goes beyond the mobile internet to embrace omnipresent Internet of Everything applications and artificial intelligence (AI) services. This shall evolve the wireless communication networks from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”. The 6G communications will enable the interconnections among lots of intelligent agents within a hyper-connected cyber-physical system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, 6G communications face with many challenges generated by constrained network resources, high energy consumption, and new attack surfaces (e.g., privacy leakage, data poisoning attacks), which continues to bring significant hindrance to their world-wide realization and deployment. Semantic communication is a brand-new communication paradigm, which meets the interaction requirements of intelligent agents in the 6G era <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, federated Learning (FL) provides a promising collaborative mode to train joint learning models for connected intelligence at the network edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Compared to the centralized learning framework, the FL allows mobile/edge devices to collaboratively extract the distributed knowledge from the data that does not leave the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The characteristics of local training and joint learning of FL is helpful to protect the privacy of information senders and receivers in 6G semantic communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

Before participating in the joint training of semantic encoder/decoder, the client needs to obtain a certificate issued by the certification center, and only the client with the legal certificate can join the FL model aggregation. Meanwhile, before receiving the encoded semantic information sent by the sender, the receiver also needs to verify if the sender’s identity is valid. </span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL still exposes many security threats. Firstly, poisoning attacks seriously threatens its usability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On one hand, since the users’ original data and the local training process is not open for the FL server, malicious FL clients may submit poisoned parameters to induce encoder/decoder errors at the model testing phase. Notably, a poisoned parameter may be diffused across all FL clients by model aggregation and distribution, thereby rendering the final global learning model to be backdoored. For a purpose-based terrorist to misguide other autonomous vehicles at the stop sign, it is possible to move forward by submitting maliciously-crafted inputs, leading to a serious traffic accident <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Therefore, any clients and parameters they submit in the FL training process need to be authenticated and traced. On the other hand, FL is also vulnerable to model poisoning attacks because it is extremely hard to guarantee that the FL server is trustworthy and robust especially when deployed in 6G edge computing scenarios. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the attacker ambitiously substitutes the aggregated global model with a malicious model to strengthen the poisoning effect. That’s why the FL server also needs to be authenticated by each client to reject false global model.
Secondly, possible privacy leakage from FL-based semantic communication systems also should be concerned. On one hand, the semi-honest FL server can reconstruct sensitive training samples (e.g. facial images, financial records, and medical images) of the targeted FL clients through the shared gradients or parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, since 6G semantic communication transmits compressed semantic information between senders and receivers, the training data can be reconstructed from the semantic representation vectors if the attacker establishes an eavesdrop mechanism on the semantic communication channels. Therefore, it is still necessary to propose an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism against such privacy leakage risks in FL-based semantic communication systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the aforementioned issues, a trustworthy FL should consider the following fundamental issues: 1) how to guarantee that users’ privacy is not leaked during the model training process and 2) how to guarantee the model robustness to malicious manipulations. Therefore, resisting poisoning attacks while protecting users’ privacy has became an meaningful and urgent demand.
Cryptography-based methods (e.g., homomorphic encryption and secret sharing) are essential to guarantee the confidentiality of shared gradients or parameters between FL clients. However, cryptography-based methods are always invalid when deployed on devices with limited computational and communication resources. For example, too high certificate management overheads reduce the practicality of PKI-based schemes in 6G semantic communication systems. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Certificateless Authentication-based Trustworthy Federated Learning (CATFL) framework for 6G semantic communications, which can efficiently defend against poisoning attacks without leaking users’ privacy. In CATFL, the FL server has two types of private key: 1) partial private key and 2) full private key, which are respectively generated by the trusted key generator center (KGC) and itself. Therefore, even an attacker who colludes with one of the CATFL server and KGC, it can not get the full secret key to impersonate, preventing the poisoning attacker from substituting the global learning model with a maliciously-modified model. Meanwhile, the CATFL is able to guarantee the trustworthiness of the local client’s gradients because of providing mutual authentication for each client. We also designate a pseudonym generation strategy to hide each client’s real identity. This strategy allows to trace the original real identity of each CATFL client by trusted third-parties, enabling to identify malicious mobile/edge devices. In a summary, the main contributions of our work are listed as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from existing advanced channel encoding/decoding and modulation techniques, semantic communication attempts to extract the “meanings” of sent information at the transmitter using artificial intelligence and then transmits these “meanings” to the receivers. With the assistance of a shared knowledge base (KB), the receiver can accurately catch the received “meanings” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
In 6G semantic communication systems, semantic encoder/decoder could be jointly trained using the FL framework for ensuring low loss rate of shared semantic knowledge and transmission accuracy. However, many security risks of FL have not yet been identified in details, lacking of effect countermeasures.

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, although the FL is designated to enhance the privacy-preserving ability, privacy leakage threats have plagued the development of FL technologies. On one hand, the untrusted parameter server may reconstruct the training data using an adversarial algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> from the gradients submitted by each mobile/edge device. This is mainly because the updated model parameters in the training process may memory sensitive information and leak them to malicious adversaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the attacker can reconstruct the training data by exploiting some query-feedback information on the targeted learning model, i.e., membership inference and model inversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The common feature of this kind of privacy leakage threat is to generate dummy samples that can approximate the real gradients, predictions, and weight parameters submitted by local FL clients.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure authentication is widely deployed as an emerging technique of exchanging model parameters and certification to provide security and trustworthiness for FL-based system against privacy leakage threats and poisoning attacks. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a verifiable federated learning (VerifyNet) framework, enabling each client to verify whether the FL server works correctly. In VerfyNet, the adversary can not deceive users by forging the identity proof unless the formulated NP-hard problem is resolved. Salvia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> provided an implementation case of secure authentication on the open-source FL platform named as “Flower”. Since there are two types of malicious behaviors: i) unauthorized manipulations to the submitted model updates; ii) sending the same model update to the FL server with multiple times, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> introduced data signatures to prevent from malicious behavior i). Meanwhile, this work also proposes to exploit blind signatures to sign local model updates only once to avoid malicious behavior of ii). However, all existing methods use the public key infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication, which is a certificate-based mechanism so that the certificate management cost and communication overheads must be affordable. Therein, many unmanned mobile/edge devices in semantic communication systems can not be equipped with such complex PKI-based authentication mechanisms. To this end, we present a novel, fundamental, efficient certificateless authentication countermeasures for deploying FL in 6G semantic communication systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce certificateless authentication into the FL-based 6G semantic communication field.

In Certificateless Cryptography, a trusted third party named as KGC is responsible to generate a partial private key (PSK) for the users. The user obtains the full private key by combining the PSK with a secret value, which is unknown to the KGC. Under this seeting, the KGC can not achieve the user’s private keys. For FL-based 6G semantic communication systems, intelligent agents are often deployed on mobile/edge devices that has limited computation and communication resources. To reduce authentication overheads and enhance the FL trustworthiness, using Certificateless Cryptography to establish a novel 6G communication architecture has became an urgent and important demand.

The proposed CATFL framework has two different communication levels: 1) upper level, and 2) lower level. The upper level contains the communications between the TRA and KGC, as well as Server-to-User (S2U) communications via a secret channel, while the lower level consists of User-to-User (U2U) semantic communications via a public channel. The system entities of CATFL is shown in Fig. 2 and explained below in detail.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Certificateless Authentication-based
Trustworthy Federated Learning (CATFL) for 6G Semantic Communications scheme. With the certificateless authentication technique, the CATFL entities have two types of private key (i.e., partial and full), which are generated independently by the trusted authority and itself. Therefore, even an attacker who colludes with the KGC cannot obtain the participant’s full secret key. On the basis of this, the proposed CATFL can prevent the semi-honest servers from inferring the users’ private data. The security analysis and evaluation shows the proposed CATFL has higher security and lower communication cost against poisoning attacks and privacy leakage threats. In the future, we also can introduce more emerging techniques (e.g., blockchain) to construct a secure and efficient 6G semantic communication systems.
