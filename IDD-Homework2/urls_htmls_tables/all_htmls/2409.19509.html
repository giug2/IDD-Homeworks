<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving framework for training machine learning models on mobile edge devices. Traditional FL algorithms, e.g., FedAvg, impose a heavy communication workload on these devices. To mitigate this issue, Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) has been proposed, leveraging edge servers as intermediaries for model aggregation. Despite its effectiveness, HFEL encounters challenges such as a slow convergence rate and high resource consumption, particularly in the presence of system and data heterogeneity. However, existing works are mainly focused on improving training efficiency for traditional FL, leaving the efficiency of HFEL largely unexplored. In this paper, we consider a two-tier HFEL system, where edge devices are connected to edge servers and edge servers are interconnected through peer-to-peer (P2P) edge backhauls. Our goal is to enhance the training efficiency of the HFEL system through strategic resource allocation and topology design. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total training latency by allocating the computation and communication resources, as well as adjusting the P2P connections. To ensure convergence under dynamic topologies, we analyze the convergence error bound and introduce a model consensus constraint into the optimization problem. The proposed problem is then decomposed into several subproblems, enabling us to alternatively solve it online. Our method facilitates the efficient implementation of large-scale FL at edge networks under data and system heterogeneity. Comprehensive experiment evaluation on benchmark datasets validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant reductions in training latency while maintaining the model accuracy compared to various baselines.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread adoption of edge devices, such as smartphones and Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, each possessing advanced sensing, computing, and storage capabilities, results in an enormous amount of data being produced daily at the network edge. Concurrently, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) facilitate the extraction of valuable knowledge from extensive data. The integration of 5G networks with AI/ML technologies is driving the development of numerous innovative applications that have significant economic and social impacts, such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, real-time video analytics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, mobile healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and smart manufacturing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. A key characteristic of these new applications is the substantial and continuously streaming data they produce, which requires efficient processing for real-time learning and decision-making. However, despite these advancements, data sharing is impeded by privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and hardware constraints, like limited communication bandwidth. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> emerges as a promising solution to these challenges by enabling model training directly on mobile devices in a decentralized manner. FL not only enhances privacy protection but also leverages the computational resources of edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a standard FL architecture, the system comprises a cloud-based Parameter Server (PS) and multiple clients<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Note that we use clients and mobile devices interchangeably in this paper.</span></span></span>. The PS orchestrates the training procedure while the clients carry out model training. The training process consists of multiple communication rounds between the clients and the PS. In each round, each selected client downloads the most recent global model from PS and updates the model using its local data. Then, these updated local models are uploaded to the PS, where they are aggregated into a new global model. However, the process of transferring models between the numerous clients and the PS imposes a considerable data traffic load, leading to increased training latency and network congestion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To unlock the full potential of FL over mobile edge networks, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have explored Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) by leveraging multi-server collaboration for model training. These works typically adopt a hierarchical architecture that integrates the advantage of the cloud-based and decentralized federated learning (DFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to enhance the speed and reliability of the FL system. In these works, clients are connected to a proximal edge server via wireless networks, while edge servers either connect to a central cloud server via an edge-to-cloud (E2C) network or form a peer-to-peer (P2P) network without connecting to a central cloud server. Each edge server acts as a local PS, orchestrating the training process with its connected clients. To facilitate collaborative training over broader distances and ensure a unified model across the network, edge servers engage in periodic synchronization, sharing, and updating their models with each other via E2C or P2P networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, implementing FL efficiently in realistic edge systems presents significant challenges due to two key factors. 1) System heterogeneity: Edge devices possess limited resources such as battery life, communication bandwidth, and CPU frequency. Additionally, these resources are not uniformly distributed among different devices. In traditional HFEL, the faster devices must remain idle, waiting for the slower ones to finish training in each communication round. 2) Statistical heterogeneity: The data that local devices collect are inherently influenced by their specific geographic locations or operational contexts, leading to a non-IID data distribution. This discrepancy can significantly hinder the model’s convergence speed and accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the challenges introduced by system and data heterogeneity in FL environments, recent research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> has studied optimization-based strategies to enhance the FL system efficiency. Typically, these approaches first construct an optimization problem that encapsulates resource cost, system constraints, and training performance. Then, an adaptive control strategy is developed by solving the optimization problem to optimize device resource allocation and learning task scheduling in real time. Specifically, to guarantee the performance of the learned model under devised control decisions, these studies usually conduct the convergence analysis for their learning algorithm. This allows them to derive several key insights, which are subsequently applied to the design or solution of their optimization problems. However, these studies primarily focus on cloud-based FL or DFL, and less effect has been made for the FL system with hierarchical architectures.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of a two-tier HFEL system, where edge devices are connected with proximate edge servers and edge servers are interconnected via P2P networks. Each edge server with its connected edge devices forms one cluster. Our exploration is centered on the strategic regulation of edge device CPU processing, wireless communication bandwidth, and the P2P network configuration to unveil potential efficiency gains. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem that characterizes the inherent resource constraints of the HFEL system and the relationship between resource consumption and training latency. Moreover, we introduce a consensus distance constraint within the proposed optimization problem. This constraint captures the interplay of topology design and model convergence, particularly in the context of heterogeneous system resources and data distributions. To solve the proposed problem, we decompose it into several subproblems. Then, we propose an online alternative algorithm, dubbed FedRT, to find the solution iteratively. These control decisions are dynamically adjusted based on real-time assessments of system state, environmental conditions, and available resources, ensuring an efficient HFEL system.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL at mobile edge networks faces several challenges, such as high training
latency and resource cost due to the presence of system and data heterogeneity. To mitigate these issues, several resource-optimization-based algorithms have been proposed to enhance both training latency and resource utilization of FL. For instance, Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> introduced an adaptive client sampling algorithm aimed at minimizing convergence time in heterogeneous systems. Perazzone et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a joint client sampling and power allocation scheme to reduce convergence error and average communication time under a power constraint, though their approach does not consider local computation. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> formulated an optimization problem to minimize convergence bounds by adaptively compressing model updates and determining the probability of local updates. However, these works predominantly focus on cloud-based FL, which relies on a single cloud server to coordinate the model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A few studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have explored resource-optimization of HFEL at mobile networks, where multiple edge servers are responsible for aggregating model updates from a subset of devices. In particular, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a framework for wireless networks, which enhances training efficiency and convergence in multi-cell scenarios by combining intra-cell device-to-device consensus with inter-cell aggregation while optimizing resources to minimize training latency and energy consumption. Feng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed to optimize computation and communication resources, alongside edge server associations, to minimize global costs while enhancing training performance in HFEL systems. Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> propose a joint scheduling and resource allocation scheme to improve convergence rates and reduce energy consumption in the mobile edge. The work closest to us is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which considers the cost efficiency of a Multi-Cell FL system. In their setting, the client could establish communication links with multiple servers. Their focus is client association and coordinator node selection. Different from these studies, our goal in this paper is to minimize the total learning latency while preserving the model accuracy by jointly optimizing the topology for edge servers, as well as the communication and computation resource allocations for edge devices, under both system and data heterogeneity.</p>

If slow links are removed, the convergence rate may slow down, and more resources may be required to finish the training. (ii) Control decisions in the objective function and constraints are time-slot interconnected, yet we lack knowledge of system stats like cluster communication environment and edge backhaul speed. Thus, we need an online algorithm that is not dependent on pre-existing information or system stats assumptions. (iii) The graph topology and resource allocation have different updating frequencies, which prevents online joint optimization.</p>

However, these works mainly focus on the convergence analysis of the learning algorithm in HFEL and assume that all edge devices are homogeneous (i.e., their computation, communication, and storage capabilities are the same) and the edge backhaul topology is given a prior. To analyze the impact of topology design on the convergence of proposed algorithms, we re-elaborate the convergence results from prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

This observation necessitates considering topology in model convergence when designing the HFEL system. For instance, if an edge model has a larger consensus distance, encouraging it to connect with neighboring servers more frequently can be beneficial for algorithm convergence and the performance of the learned model. On the other hand, if an edge model has a smaller consensus distance, we can safely remove communication links to other servers, thereby reducing training latency.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We consider a HFEL system with 72 devices and 8 servers (clusters). Each cluster has 9 devices and 1 server. In the experiments, we employ three image classification datasets: FEMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and FMNIST<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. The FEMNIST dataset is the federated splitting version of the EMNIST dataset, which includes 3,550 writers. We randomly sample 72 writers to simulate the practical HFEL application. we divide each writer’s local data into <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="90\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">90</mn><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">90</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">90\%</annotation></semantics></math> for training and <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mo id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">10\%</annotation></semantics></math> for testing. For evaluation purposes, a common testing dataset is constructed by aggregating the testing data from all devices.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The CIFAR-10 dataset is composed of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. To simulate the practical data distribution scenarios, we adopt three data partition strategies: IID distribution, Dirichlet distribution, and cluster-pathological distribution. In the case of IID distribution, the 50,000 training images are evenly and randomly distributed among all the devices, ensuring each device receives an equal share of the dataset. For Dirichlet distribution, the partitioning of the 50,000 training images among devices follows the Dirichlet distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> with a concentration parameter of 1. For cluster-pathological distribution, we first partition the 50,000 training images into 8 clusters based on the given number of labels per cluster (LC). Within each cluster, the data are distributed among all the devices in an IID fashion, similar to the IID distribution strategy. This method aims to capture the characteristics of clustered data in real-world scenarios. We train a ResNet-20 (269,722 parameters) on CIFAR-10. The original 10,000 testing images are used as the common testing dataset.</p>

Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI Experiment ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Allocation and Topology Design for Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the curve of accumulated energy consumption for edge devices w.r.t the training round on CIFAR-10 under both IID and Dirichlet data distribution. The results indicate that FedRT consistently consumes less energy than the Static-R, CE-FedAvg, and MLL-SGD throughout the training process. As the number of training rounds increases, the discrepancy between the curves becomes more pronounced, demonstrating that our algorithm consistently reduces energy costs, and its advantage becomes increasingly evident. Furthermore, the energy consumption pattern of FedRT closely aligns with that of Static-T, which also implements resource allocation for devices. This observation underscores the effectiveness of FedRT in optimizing resources for energy conservation. Moreover, we can find that FedRT consumes more energy under non-IID distribution than IID, highlighting the critical need for resource optimization under data heterogeneity.

We have similar conversations about energy consumption. In conclusion, FedRT achieves better energy usage compared with Static-R, CE-FedAvg, and MLL-SGD baselines. Although the energy consumption of FedRT is nearly identical to that of Static-T, FedRT achieves a faster convergence rate, showing an advantage in training performance.</p>

With a higher probability for edge creation, the graph topology is more densely connected. The probability is 1.0, which means the generated graph is a fully connected graph.
We illustrate the convergence rate in terms of global rounds for CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST. The data distribution for CIFAR-10 is IID. From Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ VI Experiment ‣ Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Allocation and Topology Design for Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, FedRT achieves a fast convergence rate under the IID data distribution for CIAFR-10. For FEMNIST, a loss connection leads to a slightly slow convergence rate. However, in most cases, FedRT yields a similar curve. This result demonstrates that FedRT works well under sparse base graph topology.</p>
