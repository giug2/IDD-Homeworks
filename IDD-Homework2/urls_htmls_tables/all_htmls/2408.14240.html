<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative approach to distributed machine learning. While FL offers significant privacy advantages, it also faces security challenges, particularly from poisoning attacks where adversaries deliberately manipulate local model updates to degrade model performance or introduce hidden backdoors. Existing defenses against these attacks have been shown to be effective when the data on the nodes is identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.), but they often fail under less restrictive, non-i.i.d data conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Celtibero, a novel defense mechanism that integrates layered aggregation to enhance robustness against adversarial manipulation. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and IMDB datasets, we demonstrate that Celtibero consistently achieves high main task accuracy (MTA) while maintaining minimal attack success rates (ASR) across a range of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks. Our results highlight the superiority of Celtibero over existing defenses such as FL-Defender, LFighter, and FLAME, establishing it as a highly effective solution for securing federated learning systems against sophisticated poisoning attacks.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a new machine learning paradigm for efficient distributed learning with privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Under this paradigm, a central server coordinates the generation of a global model from a set of locally trained model in the client nodes. FL aims to address the data island problem, preventing the direct disclosure of local raw data on the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. As no private data gets exchanged for training the models, FL posses an advance for applications in areas such as cybersecurity, healthcare or finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, where strong privacy guarantees are fundamental.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the FL framework is exposed to a wide variety of attacks, which can led to the leakage of clients’ data or to harm the predictive capacity and reliability of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In this context, the autonomy granted to clients in contributing to the final model also opens the door for adversarial peers to carry out poisoning attacks. In these attacks, through compromising the client’s integrity or the communication channels between clients and the server adversaries inject poisoned data or malicious model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The consequences range from diminishing the efficacy of the global model to covertly crafting a model in such a way that its outcome can be controlled by the attacker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these threats, several defense mechanisms have been proposed to the FL framework. Existing defenses against poisoning attacks in federated learning settings can be broadly categorized into Influence Reduction (IR) and Detection and Filtering (DF) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The first type of defenses aim to compute the global model using robust statistical measures, so that the effect of poisoned updates in the final aggregated model is minimal. Examples of this group include Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and Differential Privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In contrast, detection and filtering mechanisms analyze model updates sent by the nodes to identify and filter out those suspicious of being poisoned <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These mechanisms primarily rely on anomaly detectors based on unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify local models that deviate from majority <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing defenses often present accurate and resilient models against attacks. However, some are based on assumptions that break the fundamentals of FL, such as the access to clean data on the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, or propose modifications of the standard FL framework that may incur in increased communication overheads <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Other proposals instead, are devised for specific attack scenarios and may fail under different configurations. For example, defense methods that focus primarily on specific subsets of model parameters, such as the weights of the last hidden layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, may not identify poisoning attacks that extend beyond these isolated layers and affect the entire neural network. Influence reduction (IR) methods may struggle to mitigate attacks when an attacker gains control over a sufficient number of federation participants to manipulate the statistical properties used in aggregation. Defenses based on differential privacy require finding an adequate balance of noise to effectively mitigate attacks while maintaining model accuracy on legitimate data, which may be scenario dependent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, most anomaly detectors used in detection and filtering methods to identify deviating updates may prove ineffective in scenarios with non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, as the presence of numerous distributions can lead to a diverse number of anomalies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In light of these challenges, we introduce Celtibero, a novel robust aggregator that integrates both detection and filtering, as well as influence reduction mechanisms. Unlike existing literature, Celtibero is not constrained to a limited set of weights extracted from specific layers of local models to perform aggregation. Instead, the comprehensive mechanism of Celtibero performs partial aggregations at each layer, constructing the global model as the combination of all benign partial aggregations. This flexibility allows it to adapt to diverse data distributions across different layers. Additionally, our defense is designed for a typical FL framework where participant nodes are only able to access the global model update sent by the server, making no-prior assumptions about the aggregation process and how the data is distributed in the nodes, i.e., whether data in the nodes is i.i.d or non-i.i.d.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the first group, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> employs the median of model parameters for aggregation to reduce the influence of anomalous outlier models. Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> works by selecting the local model update that has the smallest sum of distances to the closest subset of other updates. As a variation of Krum, Median-Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, computes the global model as the median of the local models with minimal sum of Euclidean distances to other local models. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a differential privacy mechanism that adds random noise to the weights of local models with the aim of nullifying poisoned model weights. BaFFLe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> identifies poisoned model updates based on client feedback for class prediction on the aggregated model. While median and Krum methods assume i.i.d. data and fail in non-i.i.d. scenarios, differential privacy require setting an adequate level of noise that mitigates attack influence without compromising model accuracy, but this is not trivial. The main drawback of BaFFLe is that it overlooks the fact that backdoor attacks are designed to avoid impacting the performance of models on legitimate data, making it challenging for this defense to identify backdoored models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FoolsGold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> assigns trust scores to models for weight averaging in aggregation, based on the assumption that malicious updates exhibit characteristics not present in legitimate updates. CONTRA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> uses the pairwise cosine similarity between updates to limit the contribution of similar updates in the aggregation process, considering them potentially malicious. Similarly, RoseAgg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> performs partial aggregation of local model parameters with similar directions. The global model is then computed based on the contribution of each partially aggregated model to the principal direction of all local weights, thereby reducing the influence of local models that deviate from the principal direction of the majority. FL-Defender <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> employs the two principal components of the cosine similarity matrix, derived from the gradients of the last layer of local models, to weight updates during aggregation. The aim is to mitigate the impact of malicious updates by reducing the influence of those whose projected angles significantly deviate from the median of the projections. All these methods, however, fall short when a large or small number of poisoned models are present in non-i.i.d. settings, or when poisoned models are crafted to closely resemble benign models in terms of their angles as in some backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Defenses on the second group aim to detect an remove suspicious model updates. Auror <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> arranges local models into two groups based on the distribution of their weights, using for aggregation the models lying on the biggest cluster. DeepSight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> groups local models based on their label distribution as represented by the last layer parameters of local models. The goal is to determine local models with highly imbalanced label distributions as poisoned. FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> acts in two ways, first an outlier detection scheme is used to filter out abnormal local models. After that, the remaining models are clipped and noised before aggregation. LFighter groups local models into two clusters and identifies those lying in the more dense and smallest cluster as poisoned <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The main drawback of these methods lies in the assumption that benign local models are trained with i.i.d data, presenting limited ability in detecting poisoning attacks under non-i.i.d scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with non-i.i.d data, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> an additional model that learns the association between the local model parameters and the training data is generated on each client. Finally this model is used to identify poisoned updates that follow a specific data poisoning behavior. Nonetheless, the need of this supplementary model highly increases the computational and communication costs of FL. Instead, CrowdGuard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposes a validation mechanism on clients that is used as feedback to discard poisoned models before aggregation. However, it also assumes that each node can access other local models in the federation. This not only modifies the standard FL scheme and increases network overheads but also, could lead to craft poisoned models that target their closest local model to bypass detection.</p>

To achieve this, the adversary assigns a target label and injects a specific (backdoor) pattern into the features of instances in the training dataset. The goal is for the trained model to classify instances with the backdoor pattern as the adversary-chosen target class, while performing normally on instances without the backdoor pattern (legitimate). Therefore, since backdoor attacks are designed not to impact the performance on legitimate instances, they are particularly difficult to detect.

The combination of these two mechanisms enhances the robustness of Celtibero against poisoning attacks. On the one hand, the detection and filtering mechanism aims to eliminate poisoned model updates from the aggregation process. On the other hand, the influence reduction process focus on minimizing the impact of any undetected poisoned updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The two mechanisms operate at the layer level. The layered operation is especially relevant for combating attacks that spread through various layers of a model to achieve stealthiness. By accurately identifying and removing a poisoned update at a specific layer, Celtibero can break the poisoning pattern, potentially neutralizing the attack’s impact even if the malicious pattern is not fully detected across all layers. Moreover, the layered approach followed by Celtibero allows for the isolation of layer-specific poisoning patterns, which might be overlooked when considering the entire weight set collectively. Therefore, this approach allows for a more precise and effective defense mechanism with respect to defenses that examine the weights of a specific layer or the weights of all layers in a round.</p>

The gradient updates of models can be interpreted as vectors that alter the weights of the previous global model in two distinct ways: by altering their magnitude (verified by Euclidean distance) or by changing the direction of the vector (reflected in increased cosine distance) relative to the previous weight state. To characterize local models for clustering, Celtibero relies on the cosine pairwise distances between the gradient updates (line 3) as they are useful to exhibit update patterns of local models.</p>

In this regard, we hypothesize that poisoned updates will always share a training objective, which is to poison the global model. In contrast, the training objective of legitimate models may differ depending of their label distribution. Therefore, we argue that a stronger relation will always be present among poisoned model updates independently of the distribution of the data used for training in the local nodes. This relation can be captured by the hierarchical process followed by agglomerative clustering, since it progressively merges the pairs of gradient vectors with the closest angle contribution until all of them are grouped into two clusters.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Once gradient vectors have been grouped into two clusters, Celtibero labels the clusters as benign or poisoned based on their size and density. To compute the density of clusters (line 5), Celtibero uses the average pairwise cosine distance between every pair of gradient vectors lying in a cluster. Then, the cluster density is proportionally weighted based on the size of the clusters (line 6). Since poisoned updates will share a common objective, they will tend to form smaller and denser clusters. Therefore, the cluster with the smaller score is determined as posioned by Celtibero, whereas gradient updates lying in the cluster with higher score are considered benign (lines 7-10). Finally, Celtibero performs the aggregation of benign gradient updates using the median values (line 12). The entire process is repeated for each of the layers of the model. The result is a partial aggregation of benign weights <math id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{G}^{l^{\prime}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">W</mi><mi id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">G</mi><msup id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">l</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">′</mo></msup></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝐺</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑙</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3">′</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">W_{G}^{l^{\prime}}</annotation></semantics></math> at each layer <math id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">l</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝑙</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">l</annotation></semantics></math>.

Label flipping attacks, such as uLFA and tLFA, involve training malicious models with mislabeled data to poison the global model and render it unusable. Attacks such as MRA, DBA and Neurotoxin focus on introducing a backdoor pattern into the global model, allowing the attacker to produce predictions favoring a class chosen by the attacker. For MRA, DBA and Neurotoxin attacks, a random backdoor pattern is selected. In our experiments with targeted attacks, we assigned the target class for each dataset as indicated in the right column of Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experimentation ‣ Celtibero: Robust Layered Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

The first row details the performance of the baseline model using FedAvg, i.e., without any defense mechanism. The baseline model shows an 8% accuracy drop under untargeted label flipping attacks (uLFA), while the targeted version of this attack (tLFA) only affects accuracy by 1% on the targeted class. This relatively minor impact contrasts sharply with the significant vulnerability of the model to backdoor attacks, where both DBA and MRA achieve a 98% success rate. However, the Neurotoxin attack has a reduced impact, with only 10% of attacks succeeding, likely due to the dilution of malicious updates by legitimate ones during aggregation.</p>

RoseAgg is the most susceptible, with attack success rates of 97.6% and 98.5% for uLFA and MRA, respectively. FoolsGold also shows a significant weakness against MRA, with a 98.6% success rate for backdoor attacks. Additionally, FLAME and MedianKrum are notably affected by the Neurotoxin attack, with 93.2% and 91.5% of poisoned samples succeeding, respectively. In contrast, Celtibero, FL-Defender, and LFighter demonstrate robustness across all five evaluated attacks, with Celtibero emerging as the most effective defense in terms of average MTA and ASR values.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When evaluated on the IMDB dataset (see Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2.1 i.i.d data. ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimentation ‣ Celtibero: Robust Layered Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), the results are largely consistent with those observed for the MNIST dataset, with the notable exception of label flipping attacks. Due to the binary classification nature of the IMDB task, these attacks significantly degrade final task accuracy (MTA), reducing it to approximately 0.5 for models trained with vulnerable aggregation mechanisms such as FedAvg (baseline), MedianKrum, FL-Defender, and RoseAgg. Additionally, FLAME and FoolsGold exhibit classifier instability when faced with the Neurotoxin attack. In contrast, robust aggregation mechanisms such as LFighter and Celtibero demonstrate resilience across all attack types, maintaining high and stable MTA values and low ASR. However, Celtibero shows a slight vulnerability to the tLFA attack, with 18.9% ASR.</p>

The baseline models trained with FedAvg are vulnerable to all attack types, resulting in fully compromised models. Notably, employing robust aggregators does not necessarily confer resilience against attacks since most defenses fail to maintain low Attack Success Rates (ASR), particularly against MRA, DBA, and Neurotoxin attacks. Even the robust mechanisms identified in the i.i.d. scenario, such as LFighter and FL-Defender, are compromised by MRA and DBA attacks, with ASR values reaching 99%. Similarly, another popular defenses like MedianKrum and FLAME produce models successfully backdoored by MRA and Neurotoxin attacks, as indicated by their high ASR values. The only defense that proves effective across all attack types in this non-i.i.d. setting is Celtibero, which consistently keeps ASR below 2% on average while maintaining high Main Task Accuracy (MTA) values of 97%. Remarkably, Celtibero is the only defense that demonstrates complete robustness against tLFA, MRA, and Neurotoxin attacks, achieving 0% ASR in these cases.</p>

As can be seen, most robust aggregators in this scenario lead to unstable models, with Main Task Accuracy (MTA) values dropping to 0.5. This significant model degradation is caused by the aggregation mechanism when filtering out legitimate model updates. Only two mechanisms, FoolsGold and Celtibero, demonstrated stable performance on legitimate data. When comparing the two, FoolsGold yielded lower MTA values of 71.4% on average, comparing to the obtained by Celtibero models of 81.9%. Nonetheless, Celtibero is vulnerable to DBA attack with 64.5% of successful attempts with respect to the ASR of 5.6% obtained by FoolsGold.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our experimental results confirm that while existing defenses are primarily effective in FL scenarios with i.i.d. data, they often fail to prevent poisoning attacks under non-i.i.d. conditions. In many cases, these approaches resulted in low stability models, rendering them ineffective. To address this challenge, we proposed Celtibero, a novel defense mechanism based on layered aggregation through the examination of the angle contribution of updates using agglomerative clustering. Across the different experiments conducted, Celtibero consistently achieved high main task accuracy with minimal attack success rates against a range of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks in both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios. These results highlight that Celtibero is not only a highly effective defense strategy, outperforming current state-of-the-art defenses such as FL-Defender, LFighter, and FLAME, but also significantly enhances the security and reliability of the global model without compromising its stability.</p>
