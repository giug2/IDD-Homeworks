<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has been considered as an appealing framework to tackle data privacy issues of mobile devices compared to conventional Machine Learning (ML). Using Edge Servers (ESs) as intermediaries to perform model aggregation in proximity can reduce the transmission overhead, and it enables great potentials in low-latency FL, where the hierarchical architecture of FL (HFL) has been attracted more attention. Designing a proper client selection policy can significantly improve training performance, and it has been extensively used in FL studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies focusing on HFL. In addition, client selection for HFL faces more challenges than conventional FL, e.g., the time-varying connection of client-ES pairs and the limited budget of the Network Operator (NO). In this paper, we investigate a client selection problem for HFL, where the NO learns the number of successful participating clients to improve the training performance (i.e., select as many clients in each round) as well as under the limited budget on each ES. An online policy, called Context-aware Online Client Selection (COCS), is developed based on Contextual Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CC-MAB). COCS observes the side-information (context) of local computing and transmission of client-ES pairs and makes client selection decisions to maximize NO’s utility given a limited budget. Theoretically, COCS achieves a sublinear regret compared to an Oracle policy on both strongly convex and non-convex HFL. Simulation results also support the efficiency of the proposed COCS policy on real-world datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has become an attractive ML framework to address the growing concerns of transmitting private data from distributed clients (e.g., mobile devices) to a central cloud server by leveraging the ever-increasing storage and computing capabilities of the client devices. In each FL round, clients train local models using their local data and the cloud server aggregates local model updates to form a global model. Because only local model information is exchanged in FL rather than the local data, FL preserves the data privacy of the clients and hence has found applications in a wide range of problems, such as next-word prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A main bottleneck that limits the performance of FL is the delay variability among individual clients due to their local training and model data transfer via the wireless network. In standard FL, the cloud server has to wait until receiving the training updates from all the clients before processing any next step. Therefore, straggler clients who have unfavorable wireless links or low computation capabilities may dramatically slow down the whole FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This is the so-called “straggler effect”. Various approaches have been proposed to mitigate the “straggler effect”. For example, model quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and gradient sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> schemes aim to directly reduce the transferred data size and the model training complexity, thereby reducing all clients’ training and transmission delay. Asynchronous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> allows clients to train and upload training data in an asynchronous manner, and hence the cloud server does not have to wait for the slow clients to process the next step. Another mainstream and proven effective approach to address the straggler problem is client selection, which reduces the probability of straggler clients participating in FL by judiciously selecting clients in every FL round. In this paper, we aim to improve the FL performance along the lines of client selection in the context of hierarchical FL (HFL), which is a hierarchical architecture of FL that significantly reduces the communication overhead between the cloud server and the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The key idea of HFL is the introduction of multiple edge servers which reside between the single cloud server and the large number of clients. Instead of communicating directly to the cloud server, the clients only send their local training updates to the nearby edge servers, each of which performs an intermediate model aggregation. These aggregated models are further sent to the cloud server for the global aggregation. HFL significantly reduces the communication burden on the network and has been shown to achieve a faster convergence speed than the conventional FL architecture both theoretically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and empirically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Although several learning algorithms have been designed for HFL, simplifying assumptions have been made that all clients participate in each round of model parameter aggregation and hence, the “straggler effect” in HFL has not been specifically addressed. However, it is not straightforward to apply existing client selection solutions to HFL due to several unique challenges that HFL faces. Firstly, since the service area of an ES is much more restricted than Cloud Server (CS) and contains overlapping areas, the accessible clients of each ES are time-varying. This time-varying characteristic makes the client behavior of opportunistic communication more complicated, and Network Operator (NO) must carefully select the client to the corresponding ES in the overlapping area. Secondly, since the advantage of HFL is to deal with the straggler problem, how to design an efficient client selection policy is more important than traditional FL. Thirdly, the client selection decision needs to be determined based on many uncertainties in the HFL network conditions, e.g., the traffic pattern of client-ES pair and available computation resources of clients, which affect training performance in previously unknown ways. Therefore, a learning-based client selection policy is preferred to a solely optimization-based policy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate the client selection problem for HFL and propose a new learning-based policy, called Context-aware Online Client Selection (COCS). COCS is developed based on a novel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework called Contextual Combinatorial MAB (CC-MAB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. COCS is contextual because it allows clients to use their computational information, e.g., available computation resources, and the client-ES pairs transmission information, e.g., bandwidth and distance. COCS is combinatorial because NO selects a subset of client-ES pairs and attempts to maximize the training utilities (i.e., select as many as clients in each round) by optimizing the client selection decision. To the best of our knowledge, COCS policy is the first client selection decision for HFL. In summary, we highlight the contributions of this paper as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">1) We formulate a client selection problem for HFL, where NO needs to select clients to ESs clients to process the local training in order to make more clients to be received by ESs before deadline under limited budget. To improve the convergence speed for HFL, client selection decision has a three-fold problem: (i) estimate the local model updates successfully received by ESs with cold-starts, (ii) decide whether a client should be selected to a certain ES due to time-varying connection conditions, and (iii) optimize how to pay computation resources on clients to maximize the utility under limited budgets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">2) Due to the a priori uncertain knowledge of participated clients, the client selection problem is formulated as a CC-MAB problem. An online learning policy called Context-aware Online Client Selection (COCS) is developed, which leverages the contextual information such as downloading channel state and local computing time over aggregation round for making a decision. For the strongly convex HFL, we analyze the utility loss of COCS, termed regret, compared to the Oracle solution that knows the exacted information of participated clients. A sublinear regret bound is derived for the proposed COCS policy, which implies that COCS can produce asymptotically optimal client selection decisions for HFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.2" class="ltx_p">3) For non-convex HFL, the utility function of the convergence speed is quadratically related to the number of participated clients. By assuming that the information of each client-ES pair is perfectly known by NO, we show that the client selection problem is a submodular maximization problem with <math id="S1.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p7.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p7.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p7.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p7.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> knapsack and one matroid constraints, where <math id="S1.p7.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p7.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p7.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p7.2.m2.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p7.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p7.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p7.2.m2.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p7.2.m2.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> is the number of ESs. We use the Fast Lazy Greedy (FLGreedy) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to approximate the optimal solution with a performance guarantee. To this end, the analysis shows that the COCS policy also achieves a sublinear regret.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We provide a brief literature review that includes three main lines of work: client selection for FL, HFL, and the MAB problems for FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the heterogeneous clients and limited resources of wireless FL networks, client selection can significantly improve the performance of FL in terms of convergence speed and training latency. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> designs a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (the local model updates and the global model are considered as states) to select clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> uses gradient information to select clients. If the inner product between the client’s local and global gradient is negative, it will be excluded. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, they develop a system model to estimate the total number of aggregation rounds and design a greedy algorithm to jointly optimize client selection and bandwidth allocation throughout the training process, thereby minimizing the training latency. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> designs a dynamic client sampling method. In the early aggregation rounds, fewer clients are selected, and more clients in later rounds. This method has been proven to improve the training loss and accuracy as well as decreasing the overall energy consumption. These client selection methods focus on the conventional FL, which is different from our consideration of HFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">HFL has been considered to be a more practical FL framework for the current MEC system, since the hierarchical architecture makes FL communication more efficient and significantly reduces the latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Later, some studies improve the performance of HFL from different perspectives or use it in some other applications. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> propose a detailed convergence analysis of HFL, showing that the convergence speed of HFL achieves a linear speedup of conventional FL. Recently, FL has attracted the more interest, especially with the rapid development of ML applications on IoT devices. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> designs a hierarchical blockchain framework for knowledge sharing on smart vehicles, which learn the environmental data through ML methods and share the learning knowledge with others. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> uses HFL to better adapt to personalized modeling tasks and protect private information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The MAB problem has been extensively studied to address the key trade-off between exploration and exploitation making under uncertain environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and it has been used in FL for designing the client scheduling or selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> designs a client scheduling problem and provides a MAB-based framework for FL training without knowing the wireless channel state information and the dynamic usage of local computing resources. In order to minimize the latency, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> models fair-guaranteed client selection as a Lyapunov optimization problem and presents a policy based on CC-MAB to estimate the model transmission time. A multi-agent MAB algorithm is developed to minimize the FL training latency over wireless channels, constrained by training performance as well as each client’s differential privacy requirement in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. In this paper, the COCS policy is proposed to select clients for HFL. Due to the dynamic connection conditions of the client-ES pair and the limited available computing capacities of clients in each edge aggregation round, the COCS policy faces more challenges than these studies.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The following challenges should be addressed to solve the client selection problem in HFL networks: (i) For maximizing the expected training utility of HFL, it is necessary to precisely estimate the selected clients in each edge aggregation round. In addition, since NO does not have enough experience to determine the selected clients at the first several rounds (i.e., cold start), collecting the historical data for estimation is important for this policy. (ii) With the successful participated clients estimation, how to optimize the selection decision on each ES under the limited budget should be carefully considered, because high variance of number of participated clients on each ES degrades the training performance. Therefore, we equally separate the total budget to each ES (constraint (<a href="#S3.E9.2" title="In 9 ‣ III-E Client Selection Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9b</span></a>)). (iii) Due to the movement of each client, the available connecting ESs can be considered as time-varying (constraint (<a href="#S3.E9.3" title="In 9 ‣ III-E Client Selection Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9c</span></a>)), which brings more difficulties to make an efficient client selection decision.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we formulate our client selection problem of HFL as a Contextual Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CC-MAB). The combinatorial property is because NO pays computation resources from multiple clients for maximizing the training utility. The contextual property is because NO leverages contexts associated with clients to infer their participated probabilities. In this paper, whether successfully participating in the corresponding ES depends on many side factors, which are collaboratively referred to as <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">context</span>.

<p id="S5.p1.4" class="ltx_p">The problem <span id="S5.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P3</span> is also a combinatorial optimization problem. While <span id="S5.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">brute-force</span> search can always find the optimal solution, the complexity can be high due to the non-linear property in Eq. (<a href="#S5.E20" title="In V COCS for Non-convex HFL ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a>).

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">1) Comparison on cumulative utilities:</span> Fig. 2 shows the cumulative utilities and regret obtained by the COCS policy and the other 4 benchmarks during 1,000 edge aggregation rounds under logistic regression on the MNIST dataset. For the cumulative utilities in Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-B Comparison Benchmarks ‣ VI Simulations ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is observed that Oracle achieves the highest cumulative utilities and provides an upper bound to the other benchmarks as expected. Among the others, COCS policy significantly outperforms the other benchmarks and has a closed cumulative utility performance to Oracle. The profit of the context of client-ES pairs can be shown by comparing the performance of context-aware policy (LinUCB) and context-unaware policies (CUCB and Random). Moreover, the results indicate that the cumulative utilities of CUCB are similar to the Random policy. The disadvantage of CUCB is from the following two reasons: (1) an arm of CUCB is a combination of the selection decisions of all client-ES pairs, and thus CUCB has a large number of arms. This means that CUCB is difficult to enter the exploitation phase. (2) CUCB fails to capture the connection between context and clients. The cumulative utilities of LinUCB are based on the context, for which a CUCB arm is not effective to produce a good result due to the large arm set.

It is easy to observe that our proposed COCS policy incurs a sublinear regret.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-C Performance Evaluation of Strongly Convex HFL ‣ VI Simulations ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we present the training performance under logistic regression on the MNIST dataset from different client selection benchmarks. Oracle policy, as expected, results in the fastest convergence speed and highest accuracy among all benchmarks. Although COCS performs slower than Oracle policy during the first several rounds due to exploration, it achieves similar testing accuracy to Oracle in 200th round. In particular, it easy to observe that COCS outperforms others. Due to the insufficient selection of clients all the rounds, Random selecting clients is considerably inferior to all other benchmarks. For clarifying the training performance, we present an auxiliary Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-C Performance Evaluation of Strongly Convex HFL ‣ VI Simulations ‣ Context-Aware Online Client Selection for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> to emphasize the results, in which the targeted accuracy on MNIST dataset is set 70%. As is shown, our proposed COCS policy only uses 121 rounds to achieve 70% test accuracy, which is 36, 13 and 40 rounds faster than CUCB, LinUCB and Random.</p>

The upper bound and lower bound of clients are Oracle and Random policies. Although COCS, LinUCB, and CUCB all have increasing levels due to obtaining historical experiences, it is easy to observe that the increase of CUCB is very slow, and COCS outperforms the other two benchmarks. The reason why the number of successful participated clients are few in the first several rounds via COCS is that most of selected clients cannot be received by ESs before deadline <math id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau^{\text{dead}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">τ</mi><mtext id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml">dead</mtext></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜏</ci><ci id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">dead</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">\tau^{\text{dead}}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Since the training model and data size of CIFAR-10 is complicated enough, training performance of different benchmarks are clear to see. Oracle policy has the best performance among all benchmarks, which achieves 68.41% test accuracy.

From the convergence performance perspective, COCS also outperforms the other three benchmarks. We can conclude that COCS policy can improve the training performance for HFL significantly both on strongly convex and non-convex settings.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the client selection problem to improve the training performance for HFL. An online decision-making policy, called Context-aware Online Client Selection (COCS), was designed for NO to make proper client selection decisions for each client-ES pair. COCS was developed based on the CC-MAB framework, where NO observes the context of client-ES pairs and learns the participated probabilities to select clients and guide rental computation resources. Our proposed COCS policy departs from conventional optimization-based algorithms, which is able to work in HFL networks with uncertain information. More specifically, COCS addresses many practical challenges for HFL networks, and it is easy to implement and achieves a provably asymptotically optimal performance guarantee. Although our COCS policy has presented superior performance in extensive HFL experiments, there are still several future research questions. For example, considering dynamic partition of context space may improve the selection results, since it can generate more appropriate hypercubes. A theoretical improvement of convergence speed from COCS should also be considered.</p>
