<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL), facilitates labeled clients and unlabeled clients jointly training a global model without sharing private data. Existing FSSL methods predominantly employ pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to exploit the knowledge of unlabeled data, achieving notable success in raw data utilization. However, these training processes are hindered by large deviations between uploaded local models of labeled and unlabeled clients, as well as confirmation bias introduced by noisy pseudo-labels, both of which negatively affect the global model’s performance. In this paper, we present a novel FSSL method called Dual Class-aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (DCCFSSL). This method accounts for both the local class-aware distribution of each client’s data and the global class-aware distribution of all clients’ data within the feature space. By implementing a dual class-aware contrastive module, DCCFSSL establishes a unified training objective for different clients to tackle large deviations and incorporates contrastive information in the feature space to mitigate confirmation bias. Moreover, DCCFSSL introduces an authentication-reweighted aggregation technique to improve the server’s aggregation robustness. Our comprehensive experiments show that DCCFSSL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets and surpasses the FedAvg with relabeled unlabeled clients on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets. To our knowledge, we are the first to present an FSSL method that utilizes only 10% labeled clients, while still achieving superior performance compared to standard federated supervised learning, which uses all clients with labeled data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning technique, enabling isolated clients to collectively train a global model without sharing their private data. Due to the distributed nature of data and the cost of data labeling, distributed data from different clients presents not only statistical heterogeneity but also annotation heterogeneity, meaning that there are unlabeled datasets in addition to labeled datasets. While several FL methods, such as FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, Fedprox<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FedNova<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and MOON<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, have achieved remarkable results by addressing statistical heterogeneity, they require supervised learning (SL) with fully labeled data for each client, limiting their practical application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To leverage widely-existing unlabeled datasets to further improve FL performance, our focus on federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) with fully labeled and fully unlabeled clients in this work. Existing FSSL methods mainly employ pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to utilize knowledge of unlabeled data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For instance, FedMatch<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> considers inter-client consistency loss to encourage consistent outputs from different clients to improve the global model. FedConsist<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> aims to minimize the difference between pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled images and predictions from the same unlabeled images after augmentation. RSCFed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> that performs random sub-sampling over clients to achieve consensus optimizes the labeled and unlabeled clients by supervised cross-entropy and mean-teacher-based consistency loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods suffer from two main limitations. One is the large deviation of uploaded local models from labeled clients and unlabeled clients. The other is confirmation bias<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> induced by noisy pseudo labels. This large deviation of uploaded local models not only stem from the non-independent and identically distributed distribution (i.e., NonIID) of clients’ data but also from the difference in training objective functions employed by labeled and unlabeled clients. Specifically, labeled clients generally use cross-entropy for training on labeled data, approximating the actual data distribution with the predicted data distribution through maximum likelihood estimation. Conversely, unlabeled clients typically adopt pseudo-label-based consistency regularization for training on unlabeled data, ensuring that the learned decision boundary lies within a low-density region and that similar data points yield similar outputs. Due to these divergent training objectives, even datasets without statistical heterogeneity exhibit substantial disparities between uploaded local models from labeled and unlabeled clients. Additionally, confirmation bias emerges from overfitting to self-generated labels, as model-generated pseudo-labels often contain substantial noise due to the model’s inherent inaccuracies. Consequently, FSSL performance is substantially compromised by these two limitations. Note that RSCFed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> alleviates the deviation to a certain extent through performing random sub-sampling over clients. However, reducing the deviation by aggregation of models without considering the difference of training objectives still suffers from large deviations. Moreover, to alleviate confirmation bias, FedConsist<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> employs a high confidence threshold to filter out inaccurately pseudo-labeled data, but relying solely on model output without integrating additional information remains vulnerable to confirmation bias.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned limitations, we aim to uncover consistent knowledge at a deeper level, transcending the disparities between labeled and unlabeled clients in order to facilitate collaboration. While labeled and unlabeled clients exhibit both statistical and annotation heterogeneity, their data distributions can be viewed as components of the global data distribution. This implies that all clients share an implicit representation space corresponding to the global class distribution, irrespective of their data being labeled or not. In essence, the most valuable common knowledge beyond client differences is the global class distribution shared by all clients. Given that prototypes can serve as a straightforward and effective representation for samples within the same class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, we introduce class prototype contrastive learning to reduce large deviations by guiding all clients towards a common learning direction and mitigate confirmation bias by incorporating contrastive information.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, two main challenges persist: one is the mismatch between global and local class prototypes, and the other is the unreliability of class prototypes, particularly for unlabeled clients. Owing to the decentralized nature and statistical heterogeneity of clients’ data in FSSL, the class distribution of an individual client’s local data (i.e., local class-aware distribution) may diverge from the class distribution of the global data encompassing all clients (i.e., global class-aware distribution). Solely relying on the local class-aware distribution is inadequate to address the challenges posed by NonIID data in the context of data statistical heterogeneity. On the other hand, focusing exclusively on the global class-aware distribution may result in inconsistencies between the global class-aware distribution and each client’s potential feature space, leading to significant fluctuations in the global model and impairing the local performance of some clients during the training process. Hence, it is crucial to consider the impact of both global class-aware distribution and local class-aware distribution simultaneously, which entails conducting contrastive learning of global class prototypes and local class prototypes concurrently. Furthermore, due to the inherent inaccuracies in the model’s output, the generated prototypes may not be entirely reliable. For unlabeled clients, it is impossible to classify the generated prototypes based on data labels as we do for labeled clients, given the absence of data labels. To make use of the prototypes of unlabeled data, we can label and classify them using pseudo-labels. However, directly applying pseudo-labels to classify the generated prototypes can result in a considerable decline in model performance. This issue arises from the unreliability of pseudo-labels, which leads to the unreliability of the generated prototypes, ultimately causing the model to train in the wrong direction. Consequently, it is essential to enhance the robustness of the class prototypes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose Dual Class-aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (DCCFSSL), which mitigates large deviations of uploaded local models from significantly different training goals and alleviates confirmation bias induced by noisy pseudo-labels. On the one hand, to reduce large deviations from different clients, a unified training goal for different clients is introduced through the dual class-aware contrastive module. On the other hand, to alleviate the confirmation bias, the training process of each client is regularized by employing dual class-aware information in the feature space. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, DCCFSSL considers both local and global class-aware distributions within the feature space to tackle the mismatch between global class prototypes and local class prototypes. Moreover, we propose the concept of authentication samples to handle the unreliability of class prototypes. Based on authentication samples, we present authentication-reweighted aggregation techniques to bolster the robustness of the global model and class prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets and outperforms FedAvg with relabeled unlabeled clients on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL10 datasets. These results suggest that DCCFSSL allows FSSL to achieve competitive performance even when compared to standard federated supervised learning using labeled data for all clients. Meanwhile, DCCFSSL not only substantially enhances model performance but also greatly reduces model volatility under both IID and NonIID settings.</p>

Numerous studies have been conducted to address various challenges faced by FL, including heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

Pseudo-labeling methods generate self-predictions for unlabeled data to produce pseudo-labels, allowing the model to self-validate. This self-training process is considered self-confirming. However, due to the risk of overfitting incorrect predictions during training, pseudo-labeling methods are prone to confirmation bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

FedMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> employs inter-client consistency loss to apply FSSL in the first two scenarios. RSCFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> uses distillation on several sub-consensus models and distance-reweighted model aggregation to implement FSSL in the third scenario. FedConsist <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> adopts FSSL in a realistic COVID region segmentation, which falls under the third scenario. In this work, our focus lies on the third scenario, aiming to leverage widely-existing unlabeled datasets to further enhance FL performance.</p>

Specifically, in each round, our DCCFSSL conducts the following steps: (1) The client performs local training after receiving a new global model as initialization, then sends the updated model and prototypes back to the server. (2) The server employs authentication-reweighted model aggregation (AMA) and authentication-reweighted prototype aggregation (APA) to obtain the next global model and next global class prototypes on the server; it then randomly samples local clients and sends the current global model and global class prototypes to the selected clients.</p>

Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to assess the specific impact of various components. We also investigate the influence of the dual class-aware contrastive module on the stability of the training model. Then, we examine the influence of key hyperparameters on the performance of DCCFSSL. Moreover, we analyze the additional communication cost introduced by DCCFSSL. Finally, we investigate the effect of different ratios of labeled and unlabeled clients on DCCFSSL.</p>

According to the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we employ the Wide ResNet WRN-16-2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> as the backbone network for the experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, while the Wide ResNet WRN-10-2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> is used as the backbone network for the experiments on STL-10. Subsequently, a fully connected layer is added for classification purposes. It should be noted that the representation output dimension of the backbone network in this study is set to 128.

<p id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DCCFSSL not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates substantial performance improvements over FedAvg-SL-Upper in both IID and NonIID settings. For instance, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, DCCFSSL achieves accuracy improvements of 11.64% and 9.52% over FedAvg-SL-Upper in IID and NonIID settings, respectively. Likewise, on the CIFAR-100 dataset, DCCFSSL exhibits improvements of 7.25% and 3.18% in accuracy over FedAvg-SL-Upper for IID and NonIID settings, respectively. Moreover, on the STL-10 dataset, DCCFSSL attains 9.88% and 2.92% accuracy enhancements over FedAvg-SL-Upper for IID and NonIID settings, respectively. These results suggest that DCCFSSL, which can necessitate only 10% of clients to be labeled, outperforms conventional federated supervised learning methods that require all clients to be labeled. This highlights the potential of DCCFSSL to achieve competitive performance in federated semi-supervised learning relative to standard federated supervised learning utilizing fully labeled data.</p>

Although semi-supervised algorithms like FixMatch exhibit remarkable performance, it is essential to consider deeper collaborative characteristics in FSSL. As a result, we propose the dual class-aware contrastive module to improve FSSL in the feature space, emphasizing both local and global class-aware distributions.</p>

For example, FedConsist achieves accuracy improvements of 13.08% and 8.25% over FedAvg-SL-Lower on the CIFAR-10 dataset in IID and NonIID settings, respectively. Nonetheless, it fails to improve performance on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset. These outcomes suggest that the performance fluctuations of FedConsist and RSCFed are more pronounced across different tasks within practical FSSL settings, indicating that these methods are better tailored to specific scenarios.</p>

In addition to our proposed DCCFSSL achieving the best performance, the second best performance is consistently achieved by FedAvg-SL-Upper. This underlines the significance of data labels in influencing model performance, while also demonstrating that our proposed approach can effectively leverage unlabeled datasets in the absence of data labels.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We further analyze the dual class-aware contrastive module by examining its impact on the stability of the model training process, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-D Stability of Model Training ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As can be observed from Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-D Stability of Model Training ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, in the IID setting, the local class-aware and the global class-aware components reduce the global model accuracy fluctuation by 17.08% and 22.04%, respectively. Differently, under the NonIID setting, the global class-aware component increases the fluctuation by 66.72%, while the local class-aware component reduces it by 52.89%. These findings, together with the ablation studies, indicate that the local class-aware component can reduce the fluctuation of the global model while providing performance improvement to a certain extent. In comparison, the global class-aware component also enhances model performance but increases model volatility in the NonIID setting. In the IID setting, the global class-aware component reduces model volatility due to the homogeneous data distribution among clients. Furthermore, Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-D Stability of Model Training ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> demonstrates that the dual class-aware contrastive module significantly improves model performance while reducing model volatility in both IID and NonIID settings, effectively combining the dual strengths of the local class-aware and global class-aware components at the same time.</p>

When this ratio is too small, the dual class-aware contrastive module cannot effectively contribute to performance improvement, limiting its impact. Increasing the ratio moderately can enhance the performance of FSSL. However, when the ratio is too large, it negatively impacts the data representation capabilities of the basic training module, resulting in performance degradation instead of further improvements.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed DCCFSSL method, we upload not only model parameters but also prototype data. We evaluate the added communication cost resulting from the uploading of prototype data. As demonstrated in TABLE <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-F Communication Cost ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, the incremental communication cost for the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets amounts to a mere 0.1848% compared to the model’s communication cost, while for the CIFAR-100 dataset, the increase is only 1.817%. This modest rise in communication cost, ranging from 0.1848% to 1.817%, is deemed acceptable, particularly in cross-silo scenarios. Moreover, it is important to note that the additional communication cost is solely determined by the dimension of the prototype representation and does not increase proportionally with the growth of the model parameters.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In practical scenarios, the ratio of labeled clients to unlabeled clients can vary. Hence, we investigate the impact of different ratios on DCCFSSL performance using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Specifically, we consider seven cases where the ratios of labeled clients to unlabeled clients are 1:49, 5:45, 10:40, 25:25, 40:10, 45:5, and 50:0, respectively. The results of seven cases are as presented in TABLE <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-G Effect of Labeled Client Ratio ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. We observe that DCCFSSL performance improves as the proportion of labeled clients increases. It should be observed that relying exclusively on labeled clients does not produce the most favorable performance. This phenomenon arises because, when all clients are labeled, a slight decrease in their quantity has a minimal effect on the ultimate accuracy, given the ample availability of labeled data. In contrast, the integration of unlabeled clients contributes consistency information within the context of a high-dimensional space, which leads to a more substantial improvement in accuracy than the reduction associated with diminishing the number of labeled clients. Notably, DCCFSSL achieves 75.76% and 54.84% accuracy in the IID and NonIID settings, respectively, even with just one labeled client. This finding suggests that DCCFSSL can perform well even with an extremely limited number of labeled clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we further compare our method with FedAvg-SL-Lower and FedAvg-SL-Upper, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-G Effect of Labeled Client Ratio ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Dual Class-Aware Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. For the IID setting, even with only one labeled client, our method achieves 34.81%, and 0.78% improvements over FedAvg-SL-Lower and FedAvg-SL-Upper. For the NonIID setting, our method achieves a 19.26% improvement over FedAvg-SL-Lower but does not suppress FedAvg-SL-Upper. This result stems from the severely uneven data distribution of a single client, where some classes may have little or no data. However, as the proportion of labeled clients increases, our method’s performance significantly improves, surpassing that of FedAvg-SL-Upper in the case of 5:45.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose DCCFSSL, a novel federated semi-supervised learning method that leverages unlabeled datasets to further improve FL performance. On the one hand, DCCFSSL builds a common training goal to reduce the large deviation from uploaded local models of labeled clients and unlabeled clients. On the other hand, it introduces dual class-aware contrastive information in the feature space to alleviate confirmation bias. Meanwhile, the proposed dual class-aware contrastive module of DCCFSSL tackles the mismatch between global and local class prototypes by considering both local and global class-aware distributions within the feature space. Moreover, DCCFSSL presents authentication-reweighted aggregation based on authentication samples to improve the robustness of the global model and class prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCCFSSL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art FSSL methods. Meanwhile, DCCFSSL substantially improves the model stability of the training process. Remarkably, even when compared to the standard federated supervised learning with labeled data for all clients, DCCFSSL still achieves 2.92%<math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>11.64% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets.</p>
