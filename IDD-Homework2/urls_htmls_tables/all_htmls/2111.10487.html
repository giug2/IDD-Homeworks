<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables a group of clients to jointly train a machine learning model with the help of a centralized server.
Clients do not need to submit their local data to the server during training, and hence the local training data of clients is protected.
In FL, distributed clients collect their local data independently, so the dataset of each client may naturally form a distinct source domain.
In practice, the model trained over multiple source domains may have poor generalization performance on unseen target domains.
To address this issue, we propose FedADG to equip federated learning with domain generalization capability.
FedADG employs the federated adversarial learning approach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains via matching each distribution to a reference distribution.
The reference distribution is adaptively generated (by accommodating all source domains) to minimize the domain shift distance during alignment.
In FedADG, the alignment is fine-grained since each class is aligned independently.
In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal, so it can generalize well on the unseen domains.
Intensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that FedADG has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In deep learning, a good model should be trained over large-scale datasets to ensure its high performance.
These large-scale datasets are often collected by multiple distributed clients.
To train the model, a straightforward way is to let the clients upload their local data to a centralized server for training.
However, some clients’ local data (e.g., biometric health records, financial records, location information) maybe highly privacy-sensitive and they are reluctant to share with any other entities.
Fortunately, the proposal Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> provides a privacy-preserving mechanism that enables a centralized server to train the model without requiring clients to share their private data.
In one iteration of FL, a server sends the global model to all clients.
Then, each client trains the global model using the local data.
Next, each client sends the model update to the server, which is possible for model update aggregation and new global model generation.
After multiple rounds of iteration, the model can be well trained.</p>

Each client’s data forms a distinct source domain. We aim to develop a solution to learn a classifier (on multiple source domains) that can be used for “unseen domain” with good performance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, since distributed clients collect their local data independently, each client’s dataset may naturally form a distinct domain (a domain is defined as a set of labeled training data that are sampled from a specific distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>).
For example, <a href="#S1.F1" title="In 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a FL task in which clients need to use their collected bird images in training.
Each client usually collects different bird species (using different cameras and different shot angles), so each client’s collected dataset forms a distinct domain.
Here, the domain formed by one client’s dataset is called a source domain, so there are multiple source domains in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Most previous FL studies assume that the test dataset is a subset of client dataset.
There is a lack of studies for another common usage scenario in which the data of the target dataset (i.e., test dataset) is absent from FL training process.
It is required to build a model that has high performance when testing over the related but unseen target dataset (note that the target dataset forms the target domain).
However, the FL-trained model may have poor performance on target domains due to the discrepancies between source domains and target domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The above issue can be addressed by Domain Generalization (DG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> technique, but the previous techniques of domain generalization cannot be directly applied to FL setting.
Domain generalization aims to train a machine learning model from one or several different source domains while ensuring the trained model can be generalized well on target domains.
Most conventional solutions finish the domain generalization task in a centralized manner.
That is, a centralized server (with access to all source domain data) is responsible for the domain generalization task.
For example, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ji</span>gsaw puzzle based
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Gen</span>eralization (JiGen) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> requires data decomposed from multi-source domains to be mixed to train a classifier.
Besides, MixStyle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> needs to mix features from different source instances to synthesize new domains.
However, accessing to sources domains by the centralized server is prohibitive in FL to meet the security requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, these conventional techniques cannot be easily applied to domain generalization in FL.
There are two proposed schemes (i.e., COPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and FedDG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>) that study domain generalization problems in FL.
COPA is the abbreviation of <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ollaborative <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">OP</span>timization and <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span>ggregation, while FedDG is the abbreviation of <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated <span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span>omain <span id="S1.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">G</span>eneralization.
Both of them suffer from some limitations.
For COPA, it requires each IoT device to share its local data size.
Moreover, it leaks the global information (i.e., domain variation) to each device for batch normalization (BN) layer parameters tuning.
In a nutshell, COPA sacrifices security for domain generalization.
For FedDG, it allows each device’s local data information (i.e., image amplitude spectrum) to be shared with other entities.
However, the shared image amplitude spectrum contains class-relevant information, which can be used for training a classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
It leaks sensitive information about the device’s local data.
In summary, both COPA and FedDG sacrifice security for domain generalization.
Different from the two schemes, our solution aims to achieve domain generalization without the above information leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Federated Adversarial Domain Generalization (FedADG) scheme to address the domain generalization problem in FL.
FedADG design has two key insights as described below.
First, FedADG exploits the idea to learn the domain-invariant feature representation by aligning each distribution of source domain data to a reference distribution in a distributed manner.
In the alignment, we employ Adversarial Learning Network (ALN) to measure the distance between distributions in FL setting.
Furthermore, we propose the Federated ALN (FedALN) technique to train ALN in FL setting.
In this way, FedADG can learn the domain-invariant features while eliminating the requirement for a centralized server to access clients’ local data.
Second, FedADG uses the idea to adaptively learn a dynamic distribution (by accommodating to all source domains) as the reference distribution.
This approach can minimize the domain shift distance during alignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with using a pre-selected fix reference distribution, our approach reduces the distortion of extracted feature representation.
Therefore, the key information of the original source domain data can be largely preserved, resulting in the high generalization performance of FedADG.
Besides, FedADG takes the label information (coded as a one-hot vector) as input during the alignment process.
Hence, FedADG supports class-wise alignment, which can further improve its performance on target domains.
Furthermore, compared with using the fixed reference distribution, using the dynamically generated reference distribution approach can get more discriminative features after alignment.
The discriminative features are helpful to improve the performance of FedADG.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The high performance of FedADG can be explained via visualization, so FedADG gains some explainability to some extent.
The more explainability a FedADG scheme has, the deeper understanding that users achieve.
An explainable machine learning model can help users in two folds.
First, it can help users to tune model parameters efficiently, making it easier for further model optimization.
Second, it is more trustworthy to be used in sensitive and critical areas, where its value can be enormous.
Note that most previous domain generalization solutions
lack explainability.</p>

Fig.1 illustrates the framework of FL, which includes K clients and a centralized server.
Learning a global model on FL requires multiple iterations of training on both the server and the client.
In one iteration of FL, the server sends the initialized global model to all clients.
Then, each client trains the global model on their local dataset.
Next, each client’s model updates are sent to the centralized server and used for aggregation to generate a new global model.
After multiple rounds of iterations, the global deep learning model can be well trained.</p>

GAN endows the generative model with the ability to generate given distribution outputs via an adversarial procedure.
GAN has two components: a generator (G) and a discriminator (D).
For generator model, the generator takes random noise samples <math id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="z" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">z</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑧</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">z</annotation></semantics></math> from a given prior distribution as input.

In FL, clients do not need to share their local data to any other entities, so the local data is protected.
To improve the performance of the FL-trained model, researchers have proposed many optimized schemes, such as <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated learning with the <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Prox</span>imal term (FedProx) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, <span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated <span id="S3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">No</span>rmalized a<span id="S3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">v</span>eraging <span id="S3.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">a</span>lgorithm (FedNova) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, and <span id="S3.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MO</span>del-c<span id="S3.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ON</span>trastive learning (MOON) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Most previous FL studies assume that the test dataset is a subset of client dataset.
Different from the previous papers, this paper mainly focuses on enabling FL to train a model that has good performance on unseen target domains.</p>

The requirement of learning a model from multiple seen source domains for unseen domains motivates the research of domain generalization.
Most previous solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> consider the domain generalization problem in a centralized setting.
In these papers, a centralized server has access to data from all source domains and it is responsible for training a machine learning model that has domain generalization capability.
However, these solutions expose the source domain data to the server.
This is not allowed in FL, so these solutions cannot be directly used in FL setting.
To sum up, we summarize the comparison between the previous solutions and FedADG, as shown in <a href="#S3.T1" title="In 3 Related Work ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Tab.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

A similar concept is Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), which aims to learn an ML model from one or multi-source domain(s) that performs well on a different (but related) target domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
UDA techniques assume the availability of unlabeled target domain data.
Even if Peng <em id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> propose a privacy-preserving approach, but its test dataset participates in the training process, which is prohibited in domain generalization.
Therefore, UDA techniques cannot be directly used in this paper.</p>

FedADG first aligns each distribution of source domain data to the generated reference distribution through ALN on each client.
Meanwhile, via minimizing the loss function of distribution generator, the generated reference distribution is moving close to the “center” of all source domain distributions.
Note that the above alignment process is performed in a class-wise manner by using a one-hot vector (encoding the data label).
Besides, FedADG uses the loss function of a classifier to assist the learning of the feature extractor.
After training, in FedALN, the reference distribution and all the distributions of source domains data are aligned to learn a domain-invariant representation for domain generalization.

It can be seen from the figure that each client’s local model mainly consists of four components, which are described as follows.
<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Feature Extractor.</span>
Feature extractor can extract latent features from the raw data for each client.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Discriminator.</span>
Given features extracted from raw data
(from a source domain) and features generated by distribution
generator, the discriminator is used to distinguish the extracted features and the generated features.
During training, the discriminator gains its ability to distinguish the
above two types of features.
Besides, a Random Projection (RP) layer is pre-pended to the discriminator.
The RP layer is used to stabilize the training of ALN.</p>

During the training process, in Step s2 and Step s3, the server receives and aggregates model parameters from all clients to obtain new parameters.
Then, the server sends the aggregated parameters to the clients.
After multiple rounds of server-client interaction, the model can be well-trained.
Note that the ML model (that is constructed as the series connection of feature extractor and classifier) is applied to target domains.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under the FL settings, FedADG aligns the distributions of all source domains data to learn the domain-invariant features.
In the previous domain generalization techniques, the centralized server can access each client’s local data.
Thus, it can learn a domain-invariant feature via directly minimizing the discrepancy between the source domains using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance metric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
However, in FL, the server can not access each clients’ local data, making it hard to learn the domain-invariant features.
In our proposed Adversarial Learning Network (ALN), the distribution generator is shared among clients, indicating that the reference distribution is identical for all clients.
Thus, once the discriminator is hard to distinguish between the feature extracted from feature extractor and the feature generated from distribution generator, the generated features are considered to be invariant across multi-source domains.
Note that ALN can be trained in a federated manner (i.e., FedALN), which eliminates the requirement for centralized training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are two candidate approaches to obtain the reference distribution in FedADG: pre-selected fixed distribution and adaptively generated distribution.
Using the adaptively generated distribution can increase the performance of FedADG due to the following three reasons.</p>

Gaussian distribution is used as the fixed distribution.
It can be observed that the adaptively generated distribution would locate close to the “center” of the distributions from all the source domain features. Hence, the distances between the adaptively generated distribution and the distributions (of source domain data) are smaller than the distances between the fixed reference distribution and the source domain distributions.
Thus, using the adaptively generated distribution can reduce the distortion of extracted feature representation during alignment.
Less distortion means that the key information of the original source domain data can be largely preserved, resulting in the high generalization performance of FedADG.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Class-Wise Alignment.</span> FedADG uses the label information (encoded in a one-hot vector) in the adversarial training.
Thus, the distribution generator generates features for each class in training.
It means that the distributions of source domains data are aligned in a class-wise manner.
This fine-grained class-wise alignment approach can further improve the performance of FedADG.</p>

The distances between different class clusters in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="Figure 4b ‣ Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 How to Achieve High Performance ‣ 5 FedADG Analysis ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a> are more evident than that in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="Figure 4a ‣ Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 How to Achieve High Performance ‣ 5 FedADG Analysis ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>.
It indicates that FedADG is capable of learning more discriminative features among different classes for different source domains.
Therefore, FedADG has good domain generalization performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of FedADG.
We first compare FedADG with some recent centralized domain generalization solutions on three different datasets.
Then, we have an ablation study of the FedADG scheme.
Afterward, we investigate the in-domain performance of FedADG.
Last, we study the impact of the different reference distributions.</p>

We use four Linux terminals to simulate the deployment of FedADG.
Our server uses Geforce RTX 2080ti GPU with 24G RAM for computing.
Following most of the previous studies on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, we simulate the computation of clients on the Linux server and then measure FedADG performance.
Since the learning process is exactly the same, the performance metrics measured are accurate in our experiments.</p>

All experiments are based on three widely used datasets in DG, i.e., VLCS (Pascal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, LabelMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, Caltech-101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and SUN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>), PACS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> (Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch), and Office-Home <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> (Real-World, Clipart, Product, and Art).
All of them have four sub-datasets, which form distinct domains.
For each dataset, we utilize the leave-one-domain-out validation strategy.
That is, we let one dataset serve as the target domain and use the rest three datasets as source domains.
Like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, each domain is divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) randomly.
The well-trained model is tested on the target domain data.
Besides, we follow the protocol of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to perform experiments on PACS.
For Office-Home, we use the same protocol as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Since Office-Home and PACS have related domain types, conducting experiments on these two datasets can check the scalability of FedADG when the number of categories varies from 7 to 65.
The three used datasets are standard ones used for studying domain generation.
Thus, we can compare our experimental results with prior solutions.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Network Architecture.</span>
We test the performance of FedADG by using three pre-trained network architectures as the feature extractor.
The three network architectures are the main structure of AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, ResNet18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, or ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> without including their last layers.
Besides, the classifier consists of the last layer of these pre-trained network structures and an additional output layer.
For distribution generator and discriminator, both of them have two fully connected layers.
The two layers of distribution generator and the first layer of discriminator have the same size as the hidden representation.
The size of the second layer in discriminator is set to one.</p>

When updating the components’ parameters in FedADG, each client uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to calculate the model gradient.
In order to improve the model expression, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is used as an activation function to produce non-linear units.
From the data aspect, we use the data augmentation protocol from JiGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to improve data quality which can further improve the model expression.

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All prior solutions require centralized data access, whereas FedADG is used for domain generalization in a distributed way.
We also compare it with a recent state-of-the-art DG method: FedDG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which does not centralize the dataset and is also trained in the FL setting.
Besides, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> is used as a baseline.
We do not compare COPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> because of the following reasons.
First, it sacrifices security (refer to Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for more details).
Second, the project codes are not publicly available.
We also do not compare FL optimization methods (e.g., FedProx, FedNova, and MOON) since these papers do not focus on the domain generation problem.
These optimization methods differ from FedADG in the following aspects.
First, the source domain data in FedADG are from different clients with domain discrepancy, instead of different subsets from the same dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
Second, the discrepancy between the test datasets and training datasets in FedADG also makes it more complex than those in federated optimization methods.
Moreover, FedADG requires building a model that has high performance when testing over the related but unseen target dataset rather than seen dataset.
Note that all solutions used in the comparison are constructed using the same pre-trained network as FedADG.</p>

Furthermore, the performance of FedADG is obviously improved compared to FedDG, which is also a distributed DG method.
Besides, we observe that FedDG does not improve performance like FedADG (as the backbone size increases from AlexNet to ResNet18).</p>

These traditional ML approaches are described in Section VI-B.
In these tables, the paradigm of these traditional ML solutions is represented as “centralized w/o privacy concerns”.
That is, these solutions require the centralized server to access source domain data and expose sensitive local information.
In Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we find that the performance of FedADG is comparable to the traditional ML methods.
In particular, the generalization accuracy of the AlexNet-based FedADG on PACS is over 1% higher than the centralized approaches (e.g., MTSSL, Epi-FCR, JiGen).
Besides, Table <a href="#S6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 6.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Domain Generalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows that FedADG performs significantly better than other traditional ML methods on Office-Home dataset.
In summary, our proposed FedADG can achieve good domain generalization capability while still protecting data privacy.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An ablation study investigates the performance of FedADG by removing a certain component to
understand the contribution of the component to the overall FedADG scheme.
We perform ablation experiments on VLCS and PACS datasets using AlexNet.
Specifically, we focus on the distribution generator and discriminator, along with the data label (encoding as a one-hot vector) in these two components.
When we remove the one-hot vectors from both distribution generator and discriminator, the remained FedADG is denoted as “FedADG w/o one-hot”.
We use “FedADG w/o RP” to denote FedADG without the Random Projection (RP) layer.
“FedADG w/o G&amp;D” represents FedADG without distribution generator and discriminator.

The function of random projection is to decrease the dimension of features.
The low-dimension features stabilize the training of ALN and help to do feature alignment.

Especially in the target domains of Cartoon and Sketch, the accuracy of using the adaptively generated distribution in FedADG is about 20% higher than the accuracy of the fixed reference distribution.
The remarkable result of FedADG supports the effectiveness of using adaptively generated distribution.
It proves that the generated adaptive reference distribution can promote the performance of the model for target domains.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7 </span>Limitation</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The major limitation of FedADG is that it requires extra resources consumption in training compared with the traditional FL schemes (e.g., FedAvg).
On the one hand, clients need more computing resources to perform local adversarial training of ALN.
On the other hand, clients have a larger communication overhead since they are required to submit the updates of ALN to the server as well as receive a new global ALN model in federated training.
In a nutshell, FedADG achieves DG at the cost of extra resources consumption.
Note that the extra resources consumption is not very heavy and can be easily handled by the majority of smart devices on the market.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">8 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedADG scheme under the federated learning setting for domain generalization.
The main idea of FedADG is to learn the domain-invariant feature representation in FL while eliminating the requirement for a centralized server to access clients’ local data.
First, we propose the federated adversarial learning approach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains via matching each distribution to the reference distribution.
Specifically, we use the federated adversarial learning technique to adaptively learn a dynamic distribution (by accommodating all source domains) as the reference distribution.
Therefore, the learned feature representation tends to be universal.
Then, our proposed FedADG uses the adaptively generated reference distributions and class-wise alignment technique.
It ensures that FedADG has good generalization performance over the unseen target domains while protecting local data privacy.
Furthermore, we analyze the explainability of FedADG, which helps researchers to optimize the model and make the model more trustworthy.
Finally, the effectiveness of FedADG has been demonstrated by intensive simulations.
Thus, FedADG significantly boosts FL performance.
There are two directions to launch further research.
First, we aim to handle the scenario in which the unseen target domain contains more classes than the seen source domain.
Second, we plan to find an optimization method to automatically balance the classification training epoch and the alignment training epoch to obtain a better federated generalization performance.</p>
