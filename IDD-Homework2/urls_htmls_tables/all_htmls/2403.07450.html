<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In multiple federated learning schemes, a random subset of clients sends in each round their model updates to the server for aggregation.
Although this client selection strategy aims to reduce communication overhead, it remains energy and computationally inefficient, especially when considering resource-constrained devices as clients. This is because conventional random client selection overlooks the content of exchanged information and falls short of providing
a mechanism to reduce the transmission of semantically redundant data. To overcome this challenge, we propose clustering the clients with the aid of similarity metrics, where a single client from each of the formed clusters is selected in each round to participate in the federated training. To evaluate our approach, we perform an extensive feasibility study considering the use of nine statistical metrics in the clustering process. Simulation results reveal that, when considering a scenario with high data heterogeneity of clients, similarity-based clustering can reduce the number of required rounds compared to the baseline random client selection. In addition, energy consumption can be notably reduced from
23.93% to 41.61%, for those similarity metrics with an equivalent number of
clients per round as the baseline random scheme.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The edge computing paradigm has become a breakthrough solution that allows certain processing resources to be allocated close to the data sources rather than relying only on cloud computing centers. However,
edge-computing devices have limited computational and energy resources, which makes training complex machine learning (ML) models challenging. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an alternative for performing ML tasks in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner by having multiple clients collaborate without sharing their data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">1</span></a>]</cite>. This is because local learning clients share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to create a proper global model after a series of rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the privacy and computational sharing benefits of FL across devices, the use of multiple clients can create a communication bottleneck <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">2</span></a>]</cite>.
This may be further exacerbated by
the energy consumption spent training FL models on such resource-constrained devices.
Therefore, several studies have proposed techniques to select, at every round, a subset of clients to participate in training the global model.
However, deciding how many and which clients to choose is not straightforward, therefore a random selection method is usually adopted.
In turn, this may inadvertently
lead to the selection of similar and redundant information for aggregation, which requires a higher commitment of resources to obtain a global model suitable for all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>. Random selection may thus have
a negative impact on learning efficiency, fairness, convergence and, eventually, energy consumption.
Apart from this, data on client devices may not be evenly distributed in
real-world FL tasks,
and non-iid solutions need to be considered. The distribution divergence of non-iid data introduces significant challenges in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>]</cite>
such as lower accuracy, delays in model communication, and slower model convergence.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated
by the
challenges mentioned above, we hereby advocate for
using similarity metrics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">5</span></a>]</cite>
as a means of
grouping FL clients with similar information. To achieve this, we consider scenarios with a skewed label distribution,
and we perform cluster formulation with the aid of the following similarity metrics:
cosine function; mean squared error; Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances; maximum mean discrepancy; Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences; and Wasserstein distance.
The incorporation of such metrics
allows us to
leverage correlations in the local information to
form <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantically informative</span> clusters.
Selecting clients from these clusters minimizes the transmission of redundant information 
by harnessing the underlying heterogeneity of
local training datasets.
Consequently, it accelerates FL training efficiently.
Our twofold contribution
can be summarized
as follows:

Our goal resides in not only reducing
redundancy in the FL training phase, but also in quantifying the potential energy-efficiency gains.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The disadvantages of having all clients participating in the FL training have led several studies to investigate the development and improvement of techniques for selecting a portion of clients to join in the FL training. However, the design of an optimal selection strategy is not a straightforward task, mainly due to the detrimental effects of non-iid data distribution on the behavior of FL training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">6</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>]</cite>. For example, an experimental study is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>]</cite> that investigates six non-iid partitioning strategies for different FL algorithms.
Non-iid distributions are shown to have a significant impact on the accuracy and stability of FL algorithms, and the authors propose the implementation of client subgroups in each FL round to
deal with the instability caused by random sample selection. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>]</cite>, on the other hand, the authors use the distributions of the labels to deal with heterogeneity in a non-iid medical scenario and focus on computing the marginal distribution for each client as an optimization strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In an effort to
optimize the communication between the clients and the server, different client selection strategies have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">10</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">12</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">13</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">14</span></a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">13</span></a>]</cite>, client selection relies on the sample size and various similarity methods. As such, clients with more samples are weighted the most, which, in turn, does not prevent the transmission of redundant information, rendering this approach inefficient. It is also mentioned that measuring client similarity enables better clustering and leads to better performance. The considered similarity refers to the representative gradient, i.e., the difference between the updated model of a client and the global model, and is not extended to cluster similar clients.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">14</span></a>]</cite>, hierarchical clustering is implemented
to group FL clients according to the similarity of their model weight updates compared to the global joint model. The authors apply only distance metrics to compute the similarity between clusters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A contextual client selection framework is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>]</cite> for a vehicle-to-everything scenario. The solution comprises information sharing, traffic topology prediction, and client clustering at both data and network levels. The clients are grouped at the data level
using their gradient as a similarity criterion. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">10</span></a>]</cite>, the authors used a probabilistic deep learning model to create a personalized feature extractor integrated into each client. To estimate client similarity, the server sends the model of all other clients to each client to measure the discrepancy between the two distributions. Based on the resulting discrepancy, the server then
clusters the clients.
The gradient is also used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>]</cite>
as an insight to estimate the skewness of the client, using Hoeffding’s inequality. A dueling bandit is then used to select the clients with the lower skewness based on this estimate.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>, the authors select a subset of active clients in each FL round using the stochastic greedy algorithm, which requires knowing the gradients from these clients. For this reason, a round of local model updates is performed before sharing the updates with the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our study differs substantially from previous approaches. First, rather than focusing on developing a strategy for client selection that needs to be integrated into the training phase, we propose a solution focusing on the client side that can be more easily integrated into a federated system. This is because our solution is centered on providing a client selection strategy before the FL procedure starts.
Second, although some works have used similarity metrics to improve FL client selection, they do not provide a rigorous comparative assessment of the metrics themselves.
As such, this work aims to compare a broad set of similarity metrics to gain in-depth insights into the FL performance under different degrees of skewness in label distributions.
Lastly, it is essential to obtain more efficient and sustainable FL systems (i.e., without requesting more computational, storage, or transmit power) and, at the same time, maintain or reduce energy consumption. Thus, it may not be enough to reduce the number of FL rounds in training, especially when we do not quantify the impact on energy consumption. This is a fundamental aspect that none of the previous studies have addressed. To fill these gaps, in this work we investigate the use of similarity metrics in the optimization of FL training, using the clients’ data distribution to find a trade-off between the number of rounds and the energy consumption during this process. Relevant aspects which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been investigated in a similar study before.

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the data collected by an underlying system are usually non-iid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>]</cite>, we henceforth focus on the use of similarity metrics to capture complex relationships
among local datasets.
These metrics are essential to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between data instances. Although their use is primarily attributed to transfer learning tasks, such information measures could be applied to a wide range of
problems, such as feature extraction, information reuse, and multi-task learning, to name a few.
In our case, these statistical measures are used to form clusters, where
client selection in each round of the federated training
is performed in a way that promotes dissimilarity of selected clients, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III System Model ‣ Measuring Data Similarity for Efficient Federated Learning: A Feasibility Study The present work has been funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska Curie Innovative Training Network Greenedge (GA.

This approach
aims at a more efficient version of FedAvg scheme by avoiding
the transmission of semantically redundant information to the server.
As a result, given a certain accuracy threshold,
the number of required rounds and the energy consumption to train the global model are expected to be reduced. Consequently, the pressure on the underlying
connectivity can be alleviated
by saving network resources such as bandwidth and transmission power. Moreover, non-selected clients at every round <math id="S3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p2.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> may not perform local training, thus saving computing power.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a similarity-based client selection approach to reduce the transmission of semantically redundant data. To this end, we incorporated nine statistical similarity metrics in the FL client clustering process.
Experimental results reveal that the more heterogeneous the local client data are, the more effective our method is, capitalizing on the lower number of required rounds and reduced energy consumption in FL training compared to random selection.
In the path forward, we will direct our efforts towards integrating into our approach the quality of communication links between the participating clients and the server.
