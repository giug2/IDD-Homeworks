<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To exploit unprecedented data generation in mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional centralized machine learning (ML). By collectively training a unified learning model on edge devices, FL bypasses the need of direct data transmission, thereby addressing problems such as latency issues and privacy concerns inherent in centralized ML.
However, FL still faces some critical challenges in deployment.
One major challenge called straggler issue severely limits FL’s coverage where the device with the weakest channel condition becomes the bottleneck of the model aggregation performance.
Besides, the huge uplink communication overhead compromises the effectiveness of FL, which is particularly pronounced in large-scale systems.
To address the straggler issue, we propose the integration of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the parameter server (UAV-PS) to coordinate the FL implementation.
We further employ over-the-air computation technique that leverages the superposition property of wireless channels for efficient uplink communication.
Specifically, in this paper, we develop a novel UAV-enabled over-the-air asynchronous FL (UAV-AFL) framework which supports the UAV-PS in updating the model continuously to enhance the learning performance. Moreover, we introduce a ‘staleness upper bound’ metric to control the asynchronous level in AFL and conduct a convergence analysis to quantitatively capture the impact of model asynchrony, device selection and communication errors on the UAV-AFL learning performance. Based on this, a unified communication-learning problem is formulated to maximize asymptotical learning performance by optimizing the UAV-PS trajectory, device selection and over-the-air transceiver design. Simulation results reveal valuable insights into the UAV-AFL system and demonstrate that the proposed UAV-AFL scheme achieves substantially learning efficiency improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive data available on mobile edge devices have sparked considerable interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as image recognition and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, traditional machine learning (ML) requires the collection of data in a centralized server for model training, which incurs substantial energy and bandwidth costs, significant time delays, and potential privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Federated learning (FL), as a novel ML paradigm, has emerged to tackle these problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In a typical FL framework, each edge device computes local model updates based on its individual dataset and subsequently transmits the model update to a parameter server (PS) for model aggregation. The global model is then updated at the PS and shared with the participating devices. In this way, FL replaces direct data transmission with the model updates (gradients) transmission, which not only alleviates the communication burden but also safeguards the confidentiality of local data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the above advantages, the huge uplink communication overhead incurred in the iterative learning process remains a significant bottleneck of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>
for FL uplink model aggregation is a promising technique to reduce this communication cost. By using the superposition property of electromagnetic waves in wireless channels, edge devices can concurrently transmit their gradients utilizing the same time-frequency resources.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> thus introduce over-the-air model aggregation for FL, and the result demonstrates substantial communication efficiency improvement and latency reduction when compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. This approach is extended to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>
where over-the-air computation is applied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the communication burden, FL also encounters a new design challenge, namely the straggler issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Since the PS needs to aggregate gradients from all participating devices, the devices with poor channel conditions (i.e., stragglers) always introduce huge communication errors into the aggregated results.
This is particularly true when FL is deployed over a wide range of distributed devices where the errors from distant stragglers severely impair the overall aggregation performance.
In this context, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as PS (UAV-PS) is a promising approach to provide FL services. This is because the UAV has the ability to move closer to the stragglers and ensure reliable communication links with them.
The enhanced capabilities, such as superior communication quality and expanded coverage can be attained by utilizing the high mobility and on-demand deployment ability of UAV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
For this reason, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose to deploy a UAV as a network relay, where the UAV collects model updates from devices and then forward them to the model owner for improving the FL coverage. Moreover, in order to minimize a fairness metric regarding device computing time, a UAV-PS trajectory optimization is carried out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Till now, the UAV-assisted FL system using over-the-air computation technique has only been investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In particular, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> introduces a hierarchical aggregation approach where UAV-PS collects gradients from devices at various locations and merges them at the end of each iteration. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> dispatches the UAV-PS to assist with the aggregation of different learning models and determines the transmission scheduling using greedy deflation approach. However, these studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, while successfully integrating UAVs into the FL system to enhance learning performance, have not addressed a pivotal issue:
The synchronous structure of FL is inherently incompatible with the asynchronous nature of UAV-assisted communication systems. Specifically, in the FL system, the model aggregation is only finished when all the gradients of devices are collected.
However, the UAV-PS can only collect the gradients of the nearby devices (i.e., a subset of all devices).
This procedural incompatibility leads to a significant delay in model update until the UAV-PS navigates through the entire service area and collects gradients from all devices, which severely impairs the overall efficiency of the learning process.
A feasible solution to mitigate this incompatibility is to allow the UAV-PS to execute one FL iteration exclusively with the nearby devices. In this approach, the UAV-PS broadcasts the global model to these adjacent devices, and the latter then use the model for gradient computation. Subsequently, the UAV-PS collects the computed gradients and updates the model parameters. After that, the UAV-PS moves to another area and begins new FL iteration with the nearby devices.
However, while this scheme reduces the latency of model updates, it requires the UAV-PS to hover over the serviced devices when they conduct local gradient computation. This time-consuming local computation process<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In the internet of things (IoT) networks, edge devices often require several seconds for completing a single gradient descent (GD) algorithm due to their limited CPU capacity<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which is significantly greater than the gradient transmission time.</span></span></span>
could also adversely impact the overall learning efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fully unleash the system potential and maximize the learning efficiency, we develop a novel UAV-enabled over-the-air asynchronous FL (AFL) scheme. This scheme is generally obtained by further changing the order of
the model aggregation and broadcast steps in the framework of aforementioned solution.
Since the aggregation happens before the broadcast step, some aggregated gradients are computed based on different versions of the global model, which leads to an AFL problem.
Specifically, in the proposed UAV-enabled over-the-air AFL (UAV-AFL) scheme, the UAV-PS selects some devices to communicate with, collects these devices’ gradients over-the-air, updates the model and then performs model broadcasting to these selected devices. After that, these selected devices conduct local computation based on the newly received model while the UAV-PS continues the next round of AFL by selecting new devices without waiting for the local computations of these previously selected devices.
Compared with conventional UAV-assisted FL settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>,

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the conventional UAV-assisted FL literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the system conducts the following steps iteratively: 1) The UAV-PS broadcasts the global model to all devices. 2) All devices conduct local gradient computation based on the received model.
3) The UAV-PS navigates through the entire service area and collects gradients from all devices.
4) The UAV-PS finally aggregates the gradients and use it to update the global model.
Here, the UAV-PS can only update the global model after all devices have completed local computations and the UAV-PS has finalized the gradient collection of all devices (i.e., after step 3 and 4). Hence, this approach needs excessively long time to carry out a single model update, which significantly impairs learning efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address this issue, a straightforward choice is to allow each FL iteration to involve only the devices located near the UAV-PS. In this method, the UAV-PS traverses the entire service area and provides FL service sequentially to the nearby devices. When the UAV-PS approaches some devices, the system conducts the following steps:
1) The UAV-PS broadcasts the global model to the near devices. 2) These devices compute the gradients locally. 3) The UAV-PS collects the newly computed gradients from these devices. 4) The UAV-PS aggregates the gradients and updates the global model.
In this way, the UAV-PS can directly utilize the gradients from near devices to update the global model, thereby enhancing the learning efficiency. However, to collect the gradients (step 4), the UAV-PS in this approach cannot do anything but hover near the devices to wait for them completing local computations, which also compromises the system efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to improve the overall learning efficiency, it is crucial to develop a strategy where the UAV-PS can operate without interruption. This strategy should enable the UAV-PS to collect gradients and update models continuously for ensuring a seamless and efficient learning process.</p>

In this system, at each time slot, the UAV-PS selects a subset of devices to communicate with. Specifically, the UAV-PS collects the gradients of the selected devices, updates the global model, and then broadcast the updated model to these devices. Subsequently, the selected devices initiate computation based on the received model, while the UAV-PS continues to collect gradients from other devices for updating the model at the same time.

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI-B Comparisons Based on Different Staleness Bound ‣ VI Numerical Result ‣ UAV-Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, it is evident that a larger staleness bound provides UAV-PS more time to approach devices for gradient collection. This results in more expansive flight trajectories and reduced communication NMSE, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VI-B Comparisons Based on Different Staleness Bound ‣ VI Numerical Result ‣ UAV-Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. Conversely, with a more stringent staleness constraint, the UAV-PS is compelled to complete a service cycle more rapidly, resulting in narrower trajectories.
In the simulations, we note the UAV-PS stops communicating with devices under suboptimal channel conditions, especially when there is no proximal device. This behavior underscores the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in balancing device selection with communication quality, where the UAV-PS only aggregates the gradients when communication quality is favorable.</p>

It is evident that the proposed UAV-AFL scheme offers a substantial performance enhancement in comparison to the benchmarks, and is similar to the error-free case.
The disparities in learning accuracy across different schemes can be attributed to the characteristics of their service strategies.
Specifically,
although the accuracy of SFHF sees a rapid rise at the beginning (due to the use of all devices’ gradients for updates), it becomes stabilized at a less-than-optimal level (due to the restriction by the poor communication quality).
Moreover, because of the fully asynchronous nature of FAFL, this scheme suffers from a pronounced staleness degree (<math id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\text{MS}=114" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mtext id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2a.cmml">MS</mtext><mo id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">114</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2a.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2"><mtext id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">MS</mtext></ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">114</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.p2.2.m2.1c">\text{MS}=114</annotation></semantics></math>).

Furthermore, the learning accuracy under the HGA method experiences a slowly ascent throughout this period. This is because the hierarchical strategy necessitates the waiting for all devices’ gradient collection, which inevitably impair the learning efficiency. Lastly, the inefficient performance of CF approach highlights the importance of trajectory optimization.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the design of the UAV-AFL system over edge networks. We proposed a novel instant-update service strategy to improve the learning efficiency. We introduced a staleness bound metric to limit the level of AFL model asynchrony and derived an overall convergence bound by capturing the impact of model asynchrony, device selection and communication errors on the UAV-AFL learning performance. This bound represents a systematic endeavor to evaluate AFL performance under the consideration of both communication and learning perspectives. Subsequently, an optimization problem is then formulated to jointly determine UAV-PS trajectory, device selection and over-the-air transceiver design. To address this, we proposed a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging geometric programming (GP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) for efficient problem-solving. Our numerical results demonstrated the superior effectiveness of the proposed UAV-AFL scheme when benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
