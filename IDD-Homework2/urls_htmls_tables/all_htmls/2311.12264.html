<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Improving system-level resiliency of networked microgrids is an important aspect with increased population of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This paper (1) presents resilient control design in presence of adversarial cyber-events, and proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning (Fed-RL) approach to tackle (a) model complexities, unknown dynamical behaviors of IBR devices, (b) privacy issues regarding data sharing in multi-party-owned networked grids, and (2) transfers learned controls from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop test-bed, thereby bridging the gap between simulation and real world. With these multi-prong objectives, first, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) training setup generating episodic trajectories with adversaries (attack signal) injected at the primary controllers of the grid forming (GFM) inverters where RL agents (or controllers) are being trained to mitigate the injected attacks. For networked microgrids, the horizontal Fed-RL method involving distinct independent environments is not appropriate, leading us to develop vertical variant Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FedSAC) algorithm to grasp the interconnected dynamics of networked microgrid. Next, utilizing OpenAI Gym interface, we built a custom simulation set-up in GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform, named <span id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Resilient RL Co-simulation (ResRLCoSIM)</span>, to train the RL agents with IEEE 123-bus benchmark test systems comprising 3 interconnected microgrids. Finally, the learned policies in simulation world are transferred to the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up developed using high-fidelity Hypersim platform.
Experiments show that the simulator-trained RL controllers produce convincing results with the real-time test-bed set-up, validating the minimization of sim-to-real gap.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In achieving the goal of decarbonization and net-zero energy by 2050 as highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the adoption of networked microgrids emerges as a prominent strategy for establishing self-sustaining power grids capable of efficient integration and management of distributed energy resources (DERs). This DERs are commonly interfaced with power-electronic devices, grid-forming/grid-following (GFM/GFLs) inverters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the two basic technologies in present day’s utility-based IBRs. Commonly, GFL inverters incorporate a phase locked loop (PLL)-based design to track the grid frequency, and operates on a given phase angle regulating the active and reactive power injections, whereas GFMs possess the capability to function as controllable voltage sources linked to a coupling impedance, thereby enabling direct control over the voltage and frequency of the microgrid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and becoming a critical assets of the next generation power grid.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements show promising approaches (results) in designing primary controls of GFM technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, but when deployed in a networked microgrid, the control design does not remain limited to the primary level, rather becomes hierarchical with multiple layers spanning from primary to higher-level, as explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. That’s why these IBRs are becoming vulnerable facing various concerns related to resilience, particularly in scenarios where the power electronic interfaces could be targeted by adversarial cyber attacks, thereby destabilizing the entire power grid. Pertinent literature exploring potential cyber events impacting microgrids and resilience considerations can be found in references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, in instances involving multi-party ownership models, distinct segments within a networked microgrid might be under the jurisdiction of various utilities/operators. Such settings often involve limited data exchange and proprietary information sharing during operational phases. Furthermore, due to the growing intricacy of microgrid operations and the presence of modeling uncertainties, gaining precise knowledge about the dynamics becomes a challenging endeavor. All these lead us to pose two pivotal research questions:</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Data-driven solutions are promising avenue to eliminate the need for the exact model knowledge. In particular, Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen considerable progress over last decades solving complex nonlinear dynamic tasks in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and and can tackle uncertainties up to a certain level. RL optimizes the sequential decision making process using direct interactions with the underlying environment (the system model).
Different variants of RL, using value-based or policy gradient-based or a combination of both, can be found in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Additionally, RL problems face challenges optimizing tasks over multiple agents in a coupled dynamic environment with segregated action and state spaces; this led to the researches on multi-agent RL (MARL) such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In power systems, RL has been utilized for short-term transient voltage control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, microgrids energy storage control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, wide-area damping control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, distribution grids volt-VAr control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, load frequency regulation problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the learning framework of generic RL (single agent) and MARL do not ensure privacy regarding raw data; therefore pose challenges in learning problem related to networked microgrid problem having proprietorship data. To tackle this data privacy issues, recent studies on federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which shares model (neural network) parameters and gradients between the zones or entities instead of sharing raw data, is a promising pathway. Inline with this idea, Fed-RL, a combination of federated learning and RL, has become popular in recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Overall, Fed-RL is in early stages of development, and some recent works are found in power systems applications, Among those, utilizing Fed-RL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> solves decentralized volt-var control problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposes privacy preserving wind power forecasting method, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> deploys an energy management system for smart homes, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> introduces a peer-to-peer energy and carbon allowance trading, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> studies physics-informed reward based multimicrogrid energy management.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we primarily focus on the control design problem to improve the overall resilience of a networked microgrid by mitigating the impacts of adversarial actions at the reference signals of primary control loops of the grid-forming inverters (GFM). A recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> studies the destabilizing attacks on the primary control loops of IBRs, and proposed RL based defense design. But this work does not consider the data privacy issues from the viewpoints of a networked microgrid. Also, as reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, limited works can be found on this area. To ensure data privacy in RL, we propose a design architecture of implementing <span id="S1.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vertically</span> federated reinforcement learning framework with the multi-party owned networked (coupled) microgrid. The proposed design architecture is implemented and validated with ResRLCoSIM, developed as a part of this work, for the benchmark system IEEE-123 bus test feeder (modified) with three coupled microgrids. <span id="S1.SS1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> Please note the current work is an extension of our recently published conference paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, where we have shown proof-of-the-concept implementation. In the current work, we improved the modeling of the test systems with more realistic scenarios considering conventional generators, and inverters; most importantly,</span> as a next step, this research investigates the aspect of transferring trained RL policies to real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed simulations, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications. Real-time test-bed simulations allow RL policies to be tested and validated in a controlled environment before deployment in the real world, and provide a safe platform to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, or unintended behaviors of RL policies. This mitigates the risks associated with deploying untested policies directly into operational systems, where failures can have significant consequences. This also helps designers to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, which is the disparity between the performance of policies learned in simulated environments and their effectiveness when deployed in the real world. We have developed the test-bed simulation setup for the same IEEE-123 bus test system in the Hypersim environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, replicating the microgrid model implemented with simulation platform ResRLCoSIM. Finally, the learned control policies are implemented using Python API via the user datagram protocol (UDP) communication architecture.</p>

These device level primary controls make GFM inverters to behave more like a synchronous generator by actively participating in frequency regulation, active power sharing and mitigating problems of circulating reactive power in parallel operation.
Additionally, the underlying networked microgird model has GFL inverters as well; the details are not discussed here, as we are mainly interested in resilient control design for the GFM inverters.</p>

To this end, considering model uncertainties, unknown attack signals, fast computational aspects, data-driven methods are more promising than model-based methods. This motivated us to utilize RL as a solution by casting this resilient control problem in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) setting. RL is sequential decision making process, where an agent (controller) can learn optimal control actions based on the observations generated due to repeated interactions with a given environment.

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our setting, we emulated inverter attack by adding adversaries to a set of GFM set-points, and observe the system behavior. It is observed that the these injected attacks can make the system unstable (see no control cases in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V Experiments in Simulation platform ‣ Resilient Control of Networked Microgrids using Vertical Federated Reinforcement Learning: Designs and Real-Time Test-Bed Validations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) without any remedial actions. Please note that the unknown (or stochastic) nature of the attack signals eliminates the feasibility of any rule-based controllers. Instead, RL-based resilient and adaptive controllers can be deployed to mitigate the effects of the attack signals, but these RL controllers need to be trained. Next, we discuss on the RL-based resilient controller training with the underlying networked microgrid setting.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We simulate the microgrid dynamics using distribution grid simulator GridLAB-D. Current research trends in the RL community use OpenAI Gym platform to train benchmark RL algorithms. In line with that, we developed a simulation set-up for microgrids compatible with OpenAI Gym and suitable to train any standard benchmark RL algorithms. To achieve this, the simulation engine needs to be wrapped under a Python API. Plus, we need to implement control tasks (as a part of resilient control schemes) through GridLAB-D. This made us to utilize GridLAB-D’s subscription/publication architecture by external customized python codes using the HELICS co-simulation platform.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To fill the gap between simulation and hardware-in-the-loop implementation, here we present the architecture to test the performance of the trained resilient RL agents in the real-time simulation platform. For any numerical testing, in this work, we utilize a modified version of IEEE-123 node test systems. Resilient RL agents are trained based on the simulation of this IEEE-123 node test system in ResRLCoSIM platform of Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Software Simulation Platform: ResRLCoSIM ‣ III Translation from theory to practice ‣ Resilient Control of Networked Microgrids using Vertical Federated Reinforcement Learning: Designs and Real-Time Test-Bed Validations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>. Therefore, an equivalent IEEE-123 node test system is developed in Hypersim environment for real-time performance evaluation of the RL-agents. The synchronous generators, GFM inverters, and GFL inverters models and controllers in the GridLAB-D and Hypersim simulation platforms are made identical to ensure that the dynamic performances of the generators and inverters in these two simulation platforms matches appropriately. After verification of the controller responses, a co-simulation platform between Hypersim and Python is developed using the UDP communication protocol. Then the trained RL agent models are inserted into the Python API to monitor the responses of the inverters in Hypersim and take control actions in the presence of any adversarial scenarios.A schematic description of this implementation is provided in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Software Simulation Platform: ResRLCoSIM ‣ III Translation from theory to practice ‣ Resilient Control of Networked Microgrids using Vertical Federated Reinforcement Learning: Designs and Real-Time Test-Bed Validations" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

After this, the local critic models are sent to a centralized coordinator, for instances operator control center. Please note that in this process microgrids are not transferring any raw data, rather only the critic NN parameters are transferred. Any standard encryption/privacy-preserving techniques can be followed to even prevent any model parameter leakage. But, these data are not that sensitive like raw measurement data. Next, the task of the central coordinator is to aggregate the collected critic models infusing the influence of different microgrid’s dynamic behaviors. Like standard federated learning technique, a global (critic) model is initialized and updated using local critic models. To this end, we followed standard federated averaging (FedAvg) technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.

The dynamic simulation is performed using our developed ResRLCoSIM platform. In the RL training and testing process, the control agents send action commands to the grid and utilize the observations as feedback. The customized OpenAI Gym interface is utilized to perform RL training. The modified IEEE 123-bus test network consists of three microgrids (MG) with the coupling via tie-lines. The individual microgrids are equipped with 1 GFM inverter, 1 GFL inverter and 1 synchronous generator with rating 600 kW, 350 kW and 600 kVA, respectively with a total peak load of 3500 kW.

This simulation results clearly demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RL controllers in mitigating the presence of attacks in Microgrid network.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A novel vertical Fed-RL architecture is proposed to mitigate issues of adversarial attacks in networked microgrids. We added a resilient control layer in conjunction with the primary controls of grid-forming inverters, implemented in a multi-agent fashion and trained using novel FedSAC algorithm to recover grid voltage performance within desired bounds. We developed ResRLCoSIM, an OpenAI Gym compatible GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform to conduct the training and testing of the RL agents. After successful training and testing, the learned RL policies are transferred from simulation world to real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up. Extensive experiments have validated the proposed methods both in simulation and test-bed set up. We will continue the development of novel resilient and secured learning algorithms exploring safe RL aspects, secondary level communication failures, and other variations of adversarial attacks.</p>
