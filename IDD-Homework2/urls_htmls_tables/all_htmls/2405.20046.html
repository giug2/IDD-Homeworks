<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning benefits from cross-training strategies, which enables models to train on data from distinct sources to improve the generalization capability. However, the data heterogeneity between sources may lead models to gradually forget previously acquired knowledge when undergoing cross-training to adapt to new tasks or data sources. We argue that integrating personalized and global knowledge to gather information from multiple perspectives could potentially improve performance. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel approach that enhances federated learning through a cross-training scheme incorporating multi-view information. Specifically, the proposed method, termed FedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which enhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient federated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and local views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after model exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global knowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich information to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables the model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT alleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables it outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning aims to address the challenge of data privacy leakage posed by traditional centralized machine learning methods in scenarios where data is distributed across multiple devices or organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

Existing studies leverage model-level interactions and aggregation between participants and the server to achieve updates of the global model, which facilitates each participant to benefit from the training knowledge of others and collectively enhance the generalization of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, recent studies have revealed the fact that federated learning encounters a decline in the performance of the global model when confronted with variations in data distribution among different data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This is because the heterogeneous data distribution leads to different optimization goals in local models, resulting in significant differences in the representation distributions within their learned feature spaces, which causes local model to fit only to its specific data source.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the issue of data distribution heterogeneity, existing methods typically focus on improving the performance of local models on multi-source datasets, rather than on a single data source. They either integrate cross-training strategies to assist local models in training on multi-source datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which can expand the knowledge base that local models can learn from, or use external knowledge to guide the training of local models. This adjustment in their optimization objectives enhances the cooperative modeling capabilities among local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. For example, FedExg is recognized as the first cross-training method, which achieves an impressive performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, FedMe employs mutual learning techniques to enable client models to acquire knowledge from other data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. And PGCT utilizes prototypes to guide local models in learning a consistent feature space across different clients, which alleviates the issue of knowledge forgetting in cross-training processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. They typically only consider whether the knowledge learned by a local model within an exchange group is consistent, that is, focusing on the issue of knowledge forgetting from local view. However, the number of clients within an exchange group is minuscule compared to the entire federated learning system, which is insufficient for them to acquire a comprehensive of global knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-view knowledge-guided cross training method, termed FedCT, which expands the local knowledge base from the local view and enhances the consistency of knowledge among different clients from the global view. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the framework. Specifically, FedCT has three main modules: the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting (CAKB) module, the multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning (MVKGRL) module and the mixup-based feature augmentation (MFA) module. Considering the privacy concerns related to exposing private data, FedCT memorizes a prototypical representation for each class. The CAKB module has developed a local model assignment strategy based on prototypical knowledge consistency, which explores the fitting capability of local models to the prototypes. This can enhance the collaboration benefits between clients. The MVKGRL module enriches the local knowledge base and guides clients in constructing as homogeneous as possible class-level representations in the latent space to alleviate the challenge of knowledge forgetting from multiple views, which facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of global distributions and inter-class relationships. The MFA module focuses on enhancing the decision phase, and it aggregates rich information from both prototypes and features, which increases the diversity of the feature space. This reduces the risk of overfitting and contributes to improving the generalization performance and robustness of local models.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate the issue of dataset biases, extensive efforts have been made in existing studies on the client-side. This line of research includes regularization-based methods and cross-training strategies. These methods both aim to facilitate the learning of consistent knowledge among clients. Regularization-based methods have carefully designed regularizers to regulate local training from three perspectives, including model weights or gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, features space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and model predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. The weight-based regularization is commonly employed to ensure that the parameters of local models do not deviate significantly from the global model, which could prevent weight divergence. For example, FedProx use Euclidean distance as a regularizer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and FedDC introduces a correction term to overcome the gap at the parameter level between local and global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The feature-based regularization focuses on penalizing inconsistencies in feature space. For example, MOON uses a model-contrastive term to maximize the similarity between local and global features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, FedProc leverages class-aware prototypes to design a prototypical contrastive term to guide clients in learning aligned representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The prediction-based regularization utilizes the final predicted probability generated by the global model as supervision i
nformation to guide local training, such as FedNTD conducts distillation only for the not-true classes to mitigate forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. It has been shown that regularization methods offer a means of addressing the challenge of data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, cross-training has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing the problem of dataset bias. It aims to perform model exchange in a privacy-preserving manner to re-train a local model across different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. This expands the training data for local models, which enables them to learn comprehensive knowledge. Notably, the cross-training strategy, as an orthogonal approach to regularization techniques, can be combined with them to further enhance performance gains. For instance, FedExg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and FedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> leverage cross-training strategies to enhance the generalization of the global model and the personalized capabilities of the local models, respectively. PGCT alleviates the problem of local knowledge forgetting due to data heterogeneity and employs prototypes to guide clients in learning similar decision boundaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Despite they all expand the local knowledge base, the consistency of knowledge across clients should be of greater concern, as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A Federated Learning with Non-IID Data ‣ II Related Work ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Research on the aggregation phase is also crucial for federated learning, which is the key steps for model update. Existing methods for enhancing the aggregation efficacy lie in three main categories, which include designing novel rules to replace weighted averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, fine-tuning or retraining model after aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, and clustering-based grouping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Regarding research on designing novel aggregation rules, FedNova employs normalization averaging technique prior to aggregation to eliminate target inconsistencies and maintain rapid error convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, FedBE performs sampling to obtain higher-quality global models, and then leverages Bayesian model averaging to combine global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, PFNM proposes a probabilistic federated neural matching module to assist in constructing the global model without the need for additional supervision information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, fine-tuning or retraining the model after aggregation has also demonstrated improved performance. It aims to integrate knowledge from multiple data sources to construct a stable global model. For example, FedFTG first models the input space of multiple parties to generate pseudo-data, and then utilizes knowledge distillation to correct the biases introduced after model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. CCVR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and CReFF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> believe that the biases in the model primarily stem from the classifier, and therefore, it is not necessary to fully retrain the entire model. CCVR tunes the classifier using virtual representations sampled from an approximate Gaussian mixture model. CReFF re-trains the classifier by utilizing a set of learnable federated features available on the server and optimizes the gradients of these federated features to align with the gradients of real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another commonly used approach is clustering-based client grouping, which aims to group clients into clusters based on their similarities in data or model characteristics to reduce the intra-cluster weight divergences. A straightforward method for clustered federated learning is to group models based on their loss values on local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. However, the significant computational cost hinders the deployment of this method. Some works measure the cosine similarity of local model parameters to form groups, but this approach may be inefficient in large-scale federated settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Recent study has also developed a method to assess the differences in the feature space, which reduces computational costs while improving performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive learning has demonstrated impressive representation learning capabilities in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. Its main idea is to maximize the distance between target samples and their positive samples in the latent space while minimizing the distance between target samples and negative samples. For example, SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and Simsiam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> are two classic self-supervised learning methods. PCL combines contrastive learning and clustering for unsupervised representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. SCL utilizes label information for fully supervised representation learning, enabling advanced classification performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have employed contrastive learning to overcome heterogeneity challenges in federated learning. They typically employ contrastive loss to compare global and local representations, leveraging the comprehensive global information to guide the learning of local models, such as MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> develops a model-level contrastive learning, which maximizes the similarity between the representations of the current round’s local model and the global model’s output while minimizing the similarity with the representations of the previous round’s local model’s output and FedProc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> maximizes the consistency between sample representations and the corresponding prototype. And FedCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> and FedX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> focus on the unsupervised learning cases, they aim to learn unbiased representation from distributed and heterogeneous data.</p>

Notably, it can employ arbitrary client-based method to achieve this goal. Specifically, to assist in developing the local models assignment strategy, FedCT leverages pre-trained local models obtained by local training to extract local features and generate a class-aware prototype in representation space for each class.

It can use arbitrary methods (such as FedAvg and MOON) to optimize local model in phase I, and generate a prototypical representation for each class. FedCT develops a knowledge broadcasting strategy in phase II, which utilizes the consistency of knowledge between clients to determine the path of knowledge broadcast. In phase III, FedCT leverages multi-view knowledge to guide the cross-training process, simultaneously alleviating the problem of knowledge forgetting from both local and global perspectives.

As in the previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, we adjusted the first convolutional kernel size from 7 to 3 for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. For the VireoFood172 dataset, we kept the first convolutional kernel size as 7.</p>

The result is anticipated. This is primarily because the final performance is not only influenced by the number of exchange iterations but also by the frequency of aggregations. With the same number of interaction rounds, an increase in the number of exchange iterations leads to a decrease in the frequency of aggregations, which can affect the final performance.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section delves into a comprehensive investigation of the performance of FedCT and baseline methods in the representation space. As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-E4 Error Analysis of FedCT. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, we use TSNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> technology to visualize representations in the latent space on the CIFAR10 test dataset. We randomly selected results from two training rounds.
<span id="S5.SS5.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Obviously, FedCT outperforms FedExg and PGCT, as the decision boundaries between different class representations learned by FedCT are more distinct.</span> The model trained using the FedExg method exhibit a relatively poorer representation distribution, with overlapping features across multiple classes. PGCT enhances the model’s generalization ability and improves the representation distribution by preserving local knowledge. This result aligns with our expectations. This is primarily due to FedExg experiencing significant knowledge forgetting issues, where it learns while simultaneously forgetting, leading to limitations in its performance.
Although PGCT enforces consistency of knowledge within a single model before and after the exchange, it fails to account for the data variability and differences across various client domains.
FedCT effectively mitigates local and global knowledge forgetting issues by making full use of multi-view knowledge.
It confirms that the Multi-View Knowledge-Guided Representation Learning module contributes to enhancing the model’s generalization capability.</p>

Specifically, when local models are exchanged from client 0 to client 1, the FedExg method struggles to maintain precise recognition of samples belonging to categories 3, 4, and 9 due to their limited sample sizes, as depicted within the red box in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(a). FedCT leverages the prototypical knowledge to enhance the quality of representation learning for corresponding samples, thus significantly improving the local testing accuracy. Similarly, when the local model is exchanged from client 1 to client 0, FedCT exhibits heightened recognition accuracy for categories 1 and 5 in comparison to FedExg, as illustrated within the blue box in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(b). However, both methods faced difficulties with category 0 due to its limited sample size, which hinders the establishment of robust classification boundaries. This demonstrates that even with reliable knowledge guidance, a shortage of sufficient data samples can limit a model’s performance on specific tasks. <span id="S5.SS5.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">It highlights the significance of data quantity, particularly in scenarios requiring the handling of complex patterns and variations.</span> Furthermore, <span id="S5.SS5.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedCT achieves test performance improvements of 12.78% and 5.93% in two local models compared to FedExg.</span> This can be attributed to the cross-training mechanism guided by prototypes, which reinforces the generalization capability of each local model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a qualitative analysis of knowledge preservation and delves into the workings of FedCT from both a local and global view. We analyze the effectiveness of local knowledge distillation (LKD) by comparing the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) representation similarity between models before and after cross-training.

<p id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In general, <span id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">the fused knowledge based distillation method (FKD) combines the strengths of both global and local knowledge, which results in the highest testing accuracy</span>, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-E2 Quantitative Analysis of Knowledge Preservation. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. Specifically, the best local knowledge distillation performance is achieved when solely using LKD, followed by FKD, with GKD performing the worst, as indicated by Figure <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-E2 Quantitative Analysis of Knowledge Preservation. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(a). This is in line with our expectations since the LKD method is designed to specifically address the disparity between model outputs before and after the exchange. Furthermore, GKD employs a consistent knowledge repository to guide all clients in learning discriminative representations, which achieves the optimal preservation of global knowledge. It is worth noting that, despite methods based on FKD not achieving optimal performance from both local and global perspectives, they demonstrated the best performance in terms of testing accuracy. <span id="S5.SS5.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">This fact underscores the importance of effectively expanding the trainable sample set for local models while fostering the acquisition of consistent knowledge between clients.</span> This also emphasizes the necessity of considering both local and global factors comprehensively in federated learning.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section delves into the working of FedCT, with a specific emphasis on feature attention and model outputs. Additionally, we employ GradCAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> to generate attention maps. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-E4 Error Analysis of FedCT. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(a), the model in the first stage is able to focus on the target features. It is worth noting that FedExg, PGCT, and FedCT can all acquire new knowledge during the cross-training phase, which enables them to consistently broaden and reinforce their decision boundaries by harnessing data from diverse sources. Therefore, this further strengthens the predictions for “chair”. Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-E4 Error Analysis of FedCT. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(b) illustrates that when the model in the first phase has difficulty capturing the main features, FedExg fails due to knowledge forgetting, PGCT makes incorrect predictions with the guidence of unreliable knowledge, while FedCT can correct errors and compensate for shortcomings using global knowledge. In Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-E4 Error Analysis of FedCT. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(c), it can be observed that the model exhibits poor attention during the first stage. FedCT does not correct its prediction by cross-training, while PGCT makes the correct decision but seems uncertain. In Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-E4 Error Analysis of FedCT. ‣ V-E Case Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ Cross-Training with Multi-View Knowledge Fusion for Heterogenous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(d), both methods make errors. Especially, FedCT shows better attention to the key region and reduces the prediction discrepancy between ground-truth and the top-1 prediction. These observations provide further validation of the effectiveness of federated classification via cross-training. Furthermore, the balance between global and local knowledge is also highly crucial.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a multi-view knowledge-guided cross-training approach, termed FedCT, to tackle the issue of knowledge forgetting. Specifically, FedCT first introduces a consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting strategy, which is capable of enhancing collaboration between clients. Subsequently, FedCT develops a multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning method to guide client learn comprehensive knowledge, which extends the local training set and builds a unified knowledge base across clients as comprehensively as possible. And FedCT then leverages mixup-based feature augmentation to aggregate information, which increases the diversity of the feature space. Experimental results show that FedCT is capable of effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which leads to FedCT outperforming existing methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite FedCT has achieved impressive improvements, there are still two directions that can be further explored in future work. First, stronger local representation learning methods can guide feature alignment across clients, which can significantly enhance performance. Second, the investigation into more optimal exchange strategies is imperative, as it holds the potential to expedite model convergence.</p>
