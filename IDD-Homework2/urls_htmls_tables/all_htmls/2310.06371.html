<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Private synthetic data sharing is preferred as it keeps the distribution and nuances of original data compared to summary statistics. The state-of-the-art methods adopt a select-measure-generate paradigm, but measuring large domain marginals still results in much error and allocating privacy budget iteratively is still difficult. To address these issues, our method employs a partition-based approach that effectively reduces errors and improves the quality of synthetic data, even with a limited privacy budget. Results from our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches. The synthetic data produced using our approach exhibits improved quality and utility, making it a preferable choice for private synthetic data sharing.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data sharing is crucial for fully utilize data, but it is vital to prioritize user privacy. To protect data privacy, many experts advocate the use of differential privacy, a well-recognized technique that involves introducing noise to statistical results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, summary statistics alone may not suffice for all analysis needs. Synthetic data offers a compelling alternative for data sharing as it preserves the original data’s structure, distribution, and intricacies. It can seamlessly accommodate any analysis task originally intended for the source data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are currently two main categories of methods for generating synthetic data: (1) GAN-based methods that introduce noise to gradients, and (2) marginal-based methods that follow a <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">select-measure-generate</span> paradigm.
Previous research has indicated that marginal-based methods tend to be more accurate for generating synthetic data compared to GAN-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and recent studies have primarily focused on this approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The basic idea of a marginal-based method is to (i) select some low-dimensional marginals, (ii) measure these marginals under DP, and (iii) generate synthetic data that aligns with the noisy measurements. Within the select-measure-generate framework of marginal-based methods, the “generate” step can be effectively accomplished using private-PGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which learns the distribution from the noisy measurements according to Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). Consequently, the quality of the synthetic data heavily depends on the effectiveness of the “select” and “measure” steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The “select” step aims to find some important marginals from the workload, which can represent the entire distribution. The “measure” step aims to add noise to the selected marginals to satisfy DP. Each noisy marginal costs a portion of the privacy budget. Allocating a larger budget results in a reduced level of noise introduced by DP. If the budget is sufficient, we can afford using a large number of marginals to capture the characteristic of the distribution while introducing a small amount of noise to each marginal. Thus, it can approximate the distribution well. However, when the privacy budget is limited, both the “select” and “measure” strategies are non-trivial.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On one hand, selecting marginals that capture important characteristics of the original data within a limited privacy budget is a challenging task.
It is not feasible to use all marginals as measurements since each measurement needs to have noise added to it to protect privacy, and this noise incurs a cost in terms of the privacy budget. Therefore, the “select” part of the process aims to choose marginals that make the maximum contribution in capturing the data distribution while staying within the constraints of the limited privacy budget. Existing methods like AIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and MWEM+PGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> take an iterative approach to select marginals that are poorly approximated by the current distribution. Because these marginals tends to contribute more to learining the distribution. But they may waste some privacy budget on some marginals bringing little contribution without proper privacy allocation methods. Another approach PrivSyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> employs a greedy selection strategy select all the marginals before measuring them. It aims to minimize the error by considering both the noise of the chosen marginals and the correlation score of the unchosen marginals. This approach ensures that the selected marginals not only have low noise but also maintain important correlation of different dimensions. However, since the value of some marginals may be covered by others, PrivSyn may waste some budget for the duplicate marginals.
Thus, we need to select marginals bringing important information of the distribution while requiring little privacy.</p>
</div>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, determining the best strategy for allocating the limited privacy budget while selecting the marginals iteratively is also not straightforward. While it may seem logical to allocate more budget for larger marginals, this approach has its trade-offs. Since the privacy budget is limited, allocating more budget to one task reduces the budget available for others. Consequently, this can impact the number of measurements that can be taken, potentially affecting the overall accuracy of the data analysis. PrivSyn provides a method for privacy allocation for different margnials, but it only works on the selected marginals. Allocating privacy budget iteratively is still difficult, MWEM allocate a uniform budget for each chosen marginal, while AIM starts with a fixed budget and increases it once the current budget is not enough to choose a new marginal that contribute positively to the distribution model. These methods do not guarantee that each marginal contributes sufficiently to learning the data distribution. In scenarios where the total budget is limited, even with optimal budget allocation, each marginal receives only a small portion of the budget, resulting in a significant amount of noise. Therefore, instead of focusing on finding an optimal budget allocation method, we need to fundamentally reduce the privacy budget required for each marginal when the total budget is insufficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the first challenge, for selecting a valuable marginal in each iteration, we propose a method considering the contribution per unit privacy budget as a metric for selecting an appropriate marginal, and it also ensures that the chosen marginal provides a sufficient utility of contribution.
At first glance, it may seem simple to set the privacy budget first and then identify the marginal allocation with the highest potential contribution under that budget. However, it is important to note that the optimal selection may change if the budget is modified, and how to set the budget is not clear. Additionally, following a pre-set privacy budget does not guarantee that the chosen marginal allocation will bring sufficient contribution if all candidate marginals contribute minimally under that budget. To ensure that each noisy marginal brings sufficient contribution, we use a threshold to constrain the impact of noise on the contribution. We then compute the required privacy budget that satisfies this limit.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To address the second challenge, for reducing the error introduced by noisy measurement, we propose an adaptive partitioning approach to reduce the size of each marginal. While adding noise to each cell of the marginals is the standard method to achieve differential privacy, large margnials with a large number of cells bring significant noise error. These large marginals consume a large amount of privacy budget to ensure the untility of measurements, otherwise, they cost privacy budget without contributing much, or even negatively impacting the distribution. Merging uniformly distributed small cells into larger ones is a strategy to reduce the size of each large marginal. The count for each cell in a large partition can be estimated based on the assumption of a uniform distribution. Partition reduce the noise error but introduce the reconstruction error when the uniform distribution assumption is not true. Since our proposed selection strategy limits the utility of contribution, the only remaining task is to find the optimal partition that minimizes the required privacy budget while satisfying this constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a framework shown in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Partition-based differentially private synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which contains five main steps to learn a distribution that best explains the noisy measurements: ① compute a proper partition for each marginal in the workload according to the current distribution approximated by the private-PGM, ② select one partitioned marginal bringing the maximum potential contribution to reducing the approximated distribution error, ③ add noises to the cells of the chosen partitioned marginal, estimate each value of original marginal according to the uniformly distributed assumption and include the noisy marginal in measurements, ④ update the private-PGM model by learning the distribution well explains the measurements, ⑤ adopt the updated model to select a new measurement in the next iteration.
The main concept is to decrease the size of each marginal, thereby reducing the privacy budget required. This approach also ensures that the contribution from each marginal remains valuable even after introducing errors caused by differential privacy and partitioning. By reducing the privacy cost while maintaining similar utility of each marginal, we can allocate more budget for more marginals to capture additional characteristics of the distribution. This leads to an increase in the overall utility of the synthetic data.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, has garnered widespread attention and has now become the de facto notion in privacy protection. Researchers have provided numerous studies and theories about DP algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, but most of them are implemented for specific tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The difference is that synthetic data has a high degree of concern in the field of differential privacy because of its suitable for all data processing workflows designed for raw data. The field of differential privacy synthetic data has contributed a lot of theoretical research work for query release <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
These methods, such as MWEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, although providing theoretically optimal error guarantees, have an exponential dependence on the data demension in terms of computational time overhead. Moreover, this exponential running time is known to be necessary in the worst case. Thus, researchers have made many different attempts.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Marginal-based Methods.</span> These methods aim to derive an approximate distribution of the original data by using low-dimensional marginal information combined with generative modeling methods such as probabilistic graphs. They can be categorized into two types. (1) Workload-based methods: These methods use the workload derived from user-contributed query items to seek a query distribution that preserves statistical characteristics. For example, Gaboardi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced dual representation for optimizing data distribution, and later, Vietri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> further analyzed and solved the optimization problem using integer program solvers. RAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> utilizes a continuous relaxation of the Projection Mechanism and combines existing tools including autodifferentiation to find the best synthetic dataset. (2) Data-based methods: These methods construct low-dimensional noise marginals from data. For instance, PrivBayes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> estimates synthetic data based on measured marginals using Bayesian networks. It selects valuable measured marginals based on mutual information criteria to build the Bayesian networks. PGM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> effectively utilizes graphical models to reveal high-level information about a data distribution through noisy measurements. Many differential privacy synthesis data methods based on PGM have emerged since then. These methods follow a select-measure-generate paradigm but vary in their operation at different stages. PrivMRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> selects reasonable constraints to simplify the graphical model’s size and chooses candidate noisy measurements through Markov Random Field. It also builds a compact representation of reasonable joint probability distributions to avoid non-existent conditional assumptions in the graphical model.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Deep Generative Model Based Methods.</span> To address the need for combining differential privacy (DP) with machine learning, several methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The main idea behind thses methods is to add noise, thereby achieving privacy protection. However, the addition of noise can lead to gradient explosion, which requires gradient clipping to prevent instability. Unfortunately, gradient clipping can negatively impact the accuracy of the model, resulting in reduced performance. As a result, GAN-based methods currently have limitations and may not perform as well as other approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The selection of the ideal set of measurement candidates is crucial for those marginal-based methods. As AIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has done, the ideal joint probability distribution can be well constructed by continuously selecting the marginals that are poorly approximated according to the current model. However, the selected marginals often tend to be small in size, since large marginals containing more cells brings more noise and potentially distort the true distribution.
To overcome these limitations, we propose partition methods that aim to reduce the accumulation of unnecessary noise and improve the selection of measured marginals for learning the distribution. By selecting the marginal costing unit privacy budget that offers the highest benefit, we can prioritize the selection process and improve the overall accuracy of the synthetic data generation, especially when the privacy budget is limited at a low level.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to accurately estimate a distribution that closely resembles the true distribution based on noisy marginals, it is crucial to carefully select the marginals that provide significant value while requiring minimal privacy budget.
We have developed a new method called PPSyn, which is a partition-based private data synthesis approach. Its primary purpose is to decrease the privacy budget needed for each marginal, based on partition techniques. Furthermore we have developed a strategy to allocate the privacy budget based on the positive impact of enhancing the accuracy of estimated distribution per unit budget for each selected marginal. This allows us to make full use of the limited privacy budget, ensuring that it is allocated in the most effective manner.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the limited privacy budget, our method focuses on maximizing information the distribution model learned while minimizing privacy expenditure. To achieve this objective, we employ two steps.
First, we propose partition methods to decrease the number of cells in each marginal. By reducing the number of cells, we effectively reduce the amount of DP noise. Secondly, we prioritize the selection of marginals that provide the highest contribution to improve the model per unit budget. This ensures that our method maximizes the information gained while making efficient use of the limited privacy budget available.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In marginal-based synthetic data generation, multiple marginals are utilized as measurements to estimate the distribution of synthetic data. Each marginal consumes a certain privacy budget, and the amount of noise introduced according to DP is inversely related to the budget but directly related to the size of the marginal. Therefore, in order to capture a noisy marginal with high utility, a larger budget needs to be allocated for larger marginals. However, due to the limited total budget, allocating more to large marginals would result in reducing the number of measurements available, potentially leading to insufficient data to accurately approximating the true distribution. On the other hand, excluding large marginals may result in the loss of important distribution information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We observe that most of the data is concentrated in a small region, meaning that a large number of cells in large marginals have small values that are not crucial for estimating the distribution but contribute to introducing unnecessary noise. To address this, we propose partition-based marginal selection methods to reduce the size of each marginal based on a partition. This allows us to add noise to each interval of the partition instead of each cell of the marginal, effectively reducing the privacy budget required while maintaining similar utility. With this approach, we can capture important information from large marginals without incurring excessive privacy budget expenditure.</p>

Adding noise to each cell in the marginal directly protect the privacy but can lead to significant errors when dealing with a marginal including a large number of elements. In order to reduce the noise error, partition is a strategy. If we divide the data into intervals, we can add noise to each interval instead of each element and estimate the elements within based on the assumption of uniform distribution. Partitioning helps reduce noise error but introduces reconstruction error. We use the follow definition to show the impact of noise on the marginal with partition.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the partition-based marginal selection method that we propose. Our objective is to identify the marginal that contributes the most while utilizing the privacy budget efficiently. The error of each marginal is influenced by two factors: the noise error introduced by DP and the reconstruction error introduced by the partitioning process. Instead of pre-determining the privacy budget for each marginal, we dynamically allocate the privacy budget based on its corresponding partition. Finally, we select the measurement with the highest score in terms of the contribution while costing per unit budget.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We also extend the idea of using partition to reduce the noise error to multidimensional marginals. The size of a multidimensional marginal is typically large, as it is determined by the product of the domain sizes of each dimension. Reducing the size of the multidimensional marginal is significant in order to minimize the noise error, as the noise error is directly related to the size of each marginal.

Partitioning for a multidimensional marginal is more of a trial compared to partitioning for a one-dimensional marginal. This is because determining the optimal partition for even two-dimensional data is an NP-complete problem. It becomes difficult to iteratively merge two multidimensional interval pairs into one. Therefore, a common approach is to initially consider the entire domain as a multidimensional interval and then iteratively split the interval with the highest reconstruction error into two, as this is a more feasible strategy.</p>

The workload is derived from random selection and, similar to AIM, ensures that all chosen marginal combinations do not exceed the predetermined maximum value. (The value indirectly limits the size of the model, preventing it from becoming too large and causing intractability.) We consider that each workload of the three datasets consists of a set of three-way marginal queries, and each attribute is uniformly and randomly selected.
Moreover, the randomness in the workload should be generated using a fixed random seed to ensure consistency of the workload across different datasets and mechanisms.</p>

The 3-dimensional range queries generate all triple combinations from all attributes. Each attribute is assigned a weight sampled from a square exponential distribution. This sampling method is similar to AIM , where the randomness introduced during the construction of the workload is determined by a fixed random seed for different mechanisms. This ensures that the workload remains consistent across different mechanisms’ executions. For all three datasets, we randomly generate 210 attribute combinations to form the final workload used to evaluate the range query accuracy of different mechanisms.
Under the constraint of maximum workload, The 5-dimensional range queries consist of a total of 37 attribute combinations.</p>

In the training task, we employed 5-fold cross-validation. This means that we divided the dataset into 5 subsets, with 20% of the data reserved as the test set and the remaining 80% used as the training set for generating synthetic data for each mechanism.
To train the SVM classifier, we selected attributes of greater interest to users as the target attributes, while the remaining attributes served as features. The synthetic datasets generated by the privacy mechanisms were then used as the training set for the SVM classifier.
To evaluate the performance, we calculated the average misclassification rate across the 5 folds. This rate represents the proportion of misclassified instances in the test set.
We conducted these experiments on the ADULT and BR2000 datasets. However, we excluded the LOANS dataset from the SVM classification testing since it is not suitable for classification. The majority of attributes in the LOANS dataset are not suitable as target classification attributes. This would make it challenging to test whether the privacy mechanisms successfully retain the original features of these attributes during the classification process.</p>

Our method consistently outperforms PrivMRF in terms of classification accuracy, especially when the privacy budget is low. This indicates that our method is more effective in generating synthetic data that is suitable for the SVM classification task. As the privacy budget increases, PrivMRF’s performance in classification accuracy improves gradually. However, our method still maintains its superiority, showing a prominent improvement with increasing privacy budget.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These observations highlight the effectiveness of our method in generating synthetic data that preserves the original features necessary for SVM classification. Our method consistently outperforms other methods in terms of classification accuracy across different privacy budget settings. The reason for our method’s superior performance is that we reduce the required budget of each large marginal, which allows us to allocate more budget to choose high-dimensional marginals that represent correlations among different dimensions. By leveraging these high-dimensional marginals, our method is able to capture and preserve complex relationships between attributes, leading to more accurate classification results.
In contrast, other methods such as PrivMRF may allocate a significant portion of the privacy budget to individual large marginals, limiting its ability to capture and preserve high-dimensional correlations. This can result in lower classification accuracy, especially in scenarios with low privacy budgets.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called PPSyn for generating synthetic data. Our approach focuses on reducing the privacy budget required for each marginal while ensuring its positive contribution to the overall representation of the multidimensional distribution. By leveraging partition methods, we are able to allocate the privacy budget more efficiently, enabling us to incorporate larger marginals into the synthetic data generation process.
Compared to the state-of-the-art workload-based private data synthesis methods, PPSyn demonstrates superior performance when the privacy budget is limited at a lower level. Moving forward, we plan to extend our approach to address synthetic data generation under local differential privacy.</p>
