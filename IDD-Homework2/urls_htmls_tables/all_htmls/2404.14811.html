The key idea is to allow the participating devices to adjust their individual learning rates and local training iterations, adapting to their instantaneous computing powers.
The convergence upper bound of FLARE is established rigorously under a general setting with non-convex models in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets and imbalanced computing powers.
By minimizing the upper bound, we further optimize the scheduling of FLARE to exploit the channel heterogeneity. A nested problem structure is revealed to facilitate iteratively allocating the bandwidth with binary search and selecting devices with a new greedy method. A linear problem structure is also identified and a low-complexity linear programming scheduling policy is designed when training models have large Lipschitz constants.
Experiments demonstrate that FLARE consistently outperforms the baselines in test accuracy, and converges much faster with the proposed scheduling policy.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems will be characterized by pervasive connectivity. The volume of data generated by edge devices—spanning smartphones, wireless sensors, and wearable devices is expected to experience exponential growth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This surge in data production will catalyst widespread adoption and proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and give rise to new federated learning (FL) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In a standard FL algorithm, namely FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a fixed number <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> of local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates are performed at a selected set of devices in each training round before the updated parameters are sent to a server, e.g., a base station (BS), for aggregation. This process repeats until an adequate global model is obtained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an extension of FL, wireless FL (WFL) supports data processing and model training in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and has been applied to, e.g., online path control for massive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, distributed localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and content recommendations for mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
While FedAvg has demonstrated good empirical performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, it requires some desirable conditions as a prerequisite, which is hardly possible in real-world wireless networks.
One challenge for directly applying FedAvg in WFL is
non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) datasets among devices, also known as data heterogeneity. The data heterogeneity tends to induce significant performance degradation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Another challenge is that most FL frameworks only allow the participants to
perform the same number of local SGD iterations per communication round at a consistent training speed.
However, various edge devices may differ substantially in hardware specifications (e.g., CPU, memory, battery, etc.),
resulting in different training speeds and local training iteration numbers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, the transmission capability, such as transmit power, varies among devices in many wireless systems.
FL algorithms, typically developed under the assumption of random uniform device selection, may not be suitable, especially when the system has a limited bandwidth. Devices with poor channel conditions can be prevented from contributing to FL training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent studies have devoted significant attention to the heterogeneity of FL.
As for data heterogeneity,
the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> enhanced the training performance by assigning a globally shared dataset across edge devices.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a variance reduction algorithm called Scaffold was developed with local correction terms appended to mitigate the gradient drift.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> utilized contrastive learning at a model level to rectify local updates.
Yet, these works overlooked the device heterogeneity by assuming a consistent training speed across devices. Moreover, data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and correction terms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> would increase CPU and memory burden, making it hard to deploy FL at low-power edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate device heterogeneity,
FedProx was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> by adding a proximal term to local training, where the weight of the proximal term needs to be carefully tuned for different training tasks.
It was shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that device heterogeneity could cause objective inconsistency. Then, FedNova was designed to alleviate such adverse impacts to some extent.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, FedLin was proposed with correction terms similar to stochastic variance reduction gradient (SVRG); yet, the additional gradient computation and transmission was non-negligible. In general, the above works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> relied on full or uniformly random device selection, and their convergence under arbitrary or unbalanced device selection cannot be guaranteed. This would hinder their application in wireless edge networks, where devices often need to be scheduled based on their instantaneous or statistical channel conditions, as well as computational and communication abilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle channel heterogeneity, efforts have been directed toward achieving efficient aggregation and resource scheduling.
Recently, a new analog aggregation technique named over-the-air computation (OTA) has been utilized in FL to alleviate the bandwidth crunch from orthogonal transmission by exploiting the feature of multiple-access channel superposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, an optimal channel-adaptive power control strategy for OTA-FL was investigated.
For digital schemes, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> minimized the weighted sum of computation delay and energy consumption in each communication round under full device participation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a greedy strategy was studied to schedule as many devices as possible per round. Neither of these policies provided provable convergence.
In the absence of communication resource constraints, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> compared three scheduling policies: random scheduling, round-robin, and proportional fairness. A heuristic scheduling policy was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> with channel and update importance jointly considered.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, a channel- and data-aware scheduling strategy was developed under asynchronous aggregation, where only coarse-grained (e.g., evenly distributed) bandwidth allocation was considered.
Joint device scheduling and resource allocation were studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to improve the trade-off between training rounds and participating devices.
By assuming full gradient descent (GD) at the devices, a joint optimization problem for device selection and bandwidth allocation was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. By contrast, gradient divergence was used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to define the importance of updates and develop a scheduling strategy based on such importance and channel equality.
Considering data and device heterogeneity, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> optimized the sampling strategy in the ideal lossless transmission environments.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.6" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study a generic scenario where heterogeneity prevails in the data, computing and communication conditions of devices.
Specifically, the data may not be i.i.d. among the devices; the devices may have substantially different computing powers and hence train their local models at different paces; and the communication from the devices to the BS is constrained by limited bandwidth and undergoes non-negligible latency.

In other words, resource-constrained devices can conduct a relatively smaller number of local training iterations at faster learning rates. As a result, they can make consistent progress in local training with their more computationally powerful peers, and avoid becoming stragglers, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b).</p>

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve such a convergence rate
under non-i.i.d. data, imbalanced local updates (e.g., in terms of local iteration number per round), and arbitrary device selections in a general non-convex case, thereby validating the effectiveness of FLARE.</p>

In both figures, SPF and SP consistently outperform the benchmarks under both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. datasets.
CM performs the worst, followed by DM in all cases. This is due to their tendency to favor devices with insufficient local updates, thus hindering convergence,
even though DM considers channel states.
Similarly, CP focuses solely on the channel strengths of the devices and
overlooks their different computational abilities and unequal contributions to model updates,
while PS lacks adaptability to time-varying environments due to a persistent number of devices selected per round.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By comparing SPF and SP, it is evident that the inclusion of FLARE consistently improves performance, especially under the non-i.i.d. settings. This can be attributed to the exacerbation of differences between the local models induced by heterogeneous updates in non-i.i.d. distributions, leading to an increased performance gap between SP and SPF.</p>

and maintains a sufficient number of participating devices
in both the cases depicted in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). This indicates that it is crucial to select devices with a larger number of local updates (and hence higher contributions) while ensuring adequate device participation, to accelerate the convergence.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented the FLARE framework specifically designed to address data, device, and channel heterogeneity and expedite WFL training. Our contribution included a comprehensive convergence analysis of FLARE with non-convex loss functions under data and device heterogeneity and arbitrary device scheduling policy.
We optimized the device selection and bandwidth allocation of FLARE in the face of resource constraints by minimizing the convergence upper bound. Efficient solutions were developed by revealing a nested optimization structure of the intended problem, as well as a much simpler linear structure when the neural network models have large Lipschitz constants.
Experiments corroborated the efficacy of FLARE in mitigating heterogeneity across diverse system settings, and that the proposed scheduling policy consistently outperformed the state of the art in test accuracy.</p>
