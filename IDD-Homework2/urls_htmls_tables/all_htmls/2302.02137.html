<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Clustering in graphs has been a well-known research problem, particularly because most Internet and social network data is in the form of graphs. Organizations widely use spectral clustering algorithms to find clustering in graph datasets. However, applying spectral clustering to a large dataset is challenging due to computational overhead. While the distributed spectral clustering algorithm exists, they face the problem of data privacy and increased communication costs between the clients. Thus, in this paper, we propose a spectral clustering algorithm using federated learning (FL) to overcome these issues. FL is a privacy-protecting algorithm that accumulates model parameters from each local learner rather than collecting users’ raw data, thus providing both scalability and data privacy. We developed two approaches: <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral</span> and <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>. <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral</span> is a baseline approach that uses local spectral clustering labels to aggregate the global spectral clustering by creating a similarity graph. <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>, a state-of-the-art approach, uses the power iteration method to learn the global spectral embedding by incorporating the entire graph data without access to the raw information distributed among the clients. We further designed our own similarity metric to check the clustering quality of the distributed approach to that of the original/non-FL clustering. The proposed approach <span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span> obtained a similarity of 98.85% and 99.8%, comparable to that of global clustering on the <span id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ego-Facebook</span> and <span id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">email-Eu-core</span> dataset.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Organizations worldwide actively use graph clustering algorithms to map data into communities to infer their relationships. Particularly, spectral clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ng, Jordan, and Weiss <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Von Luxburg <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite> is one of the widely used algorithms to cluster graphs. It employs graph eigenvector embedding by preserving node relationships in euclidean space. However, applying spectral clustering on a graph with billions of nodes is challenging as it requires lots of computational cost and storage space. Researchers in the past had tried to distribute the graph and train the model in a distributed manner by achieving comparable accuracy. Nevertheless, in this case, the communication cost has increased exponentially <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Macey and Zomaya <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> also developed parallel spectral clustering based on the sparse similarity matrix. However, the major drawback of this work is that it assumes that any data in the parallel system can be accessed by any client. But, this raises concerns for data privacy if we share the information with different clients. In this work, we remove this assumption by only sharing the representations learned in the local client to the global server instead of directly communicating with neighboring clients.

Data privacy in distributed settings was the very reason for the introduction of federated learning. The new machine learning algorithms were becoming complex and required a large amount of data to generalize on a task. However, in reality, data is distributed over many organizations, and sharing them is difficult as it concerns data privacy. Thus, the ‘Federated Learning (FL)’ term coined by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> was the first to propose an algorithm that combines intelligence across the clients without compromising data security. There are two key advantages of using FL over traditional machine learning algorithms. First, it allows training the models on local devices and then sending the trained parameters to the central server; this provides privacy to local learners as there is no exchange of raw data among clients. Secondly, models are trained over different local learners and thus do not need a large dataset to be present in the central cloud.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers around the globe have tried to propose several federated learning algorithms for different machine learning models. They have tried to integrate the differential privacy-based approaches in the distributed setting. Some of the past literature works includes logistic regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen, Rezapour, and Tzeng <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nikolaenko et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, support vector machines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and gradient boosted decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cheng et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li, Wen, and He <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, we propose <span id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>, a novel algorithm for federated spectral clustering. The approach integrates the power iteration method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Booth <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> and federated learning to enhance spectral clustering by decreasing the communication cost between clients and providing data privacy. Our algorithm takes advantage of the FL technique by learning the representations locally and aggregating them over the server. Firstly, the server creates a single matrix and sends it to all the clients parallelly. The clients run power iterations over this matrix using their own data and send them back to the server. This is repeated for a fixed number of rounds till the matrix converges to the global graph embedding. The proposed approach was tested on the <span id="Sx1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ego-facebook</span> and <span id="Sx1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">email-Eu-core</span> datasets.

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of federated learning(FL) has aroused a plethora of interdisciplinary studies, primarily due to its broad applicability in privacy-constrained scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, a simple baseline, which aggregates the local client updates to obtain the global model without exchanging the raw data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lalitha et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed employing peer-to-peer FL for graph-structured data. Further, for the link prediction task, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed FedE to exploit centralized aggregation to utilize FL over knowledge graphs. However, they lack in training the multiple knowledge graphs together. Moreover, several works have also explored the FL on graph neural networks - <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. But, the use of FL in spectral clustering still remains unexplored. The nearest work includes that of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> that proposes parallel spectral clustering, which revolves around the idea of using the sparse similarity matrix. However, the major drawback of this work is that it assumes that any data in the parallel system can be accessed from any node. But, if data is shared among nodes, this compromises individual information, raising concerns about data privacy.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, in this work, we propose <span id="Sx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>, a federated spectral clustering approach that globally clusters the data shared across different clients without sharing raw data. This approach handles the problem of data privacy by using the advantage of the FL technique, which only aggregates the representations learned by the clients and, thus, no direct exchange of raw data between the clients and server. In addition, these federated spectral settings also allow one to use large datasets without worrying about the computational cost, as the data is distributed over several clients.</p>

<div id="Sx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Let there be different social network platforms. Each platform has information about the unique phone number or email address of every person registered in the network, which is the primary key in their database. For every person(represented by a node), there will be a relationship between pair of nodes(represented by an edge) within the master set of nodes. Here, the master set of nodes refers to all the phone numbers/unique ids available worldwide. If a number is not registered on a particular platform, the social network platform still takes it into consideration by making zero edges of that id with other people/ids. Furthermore, we can consider edges to hold the weight equivalent to the amount of interaction between two nodes (number of messages exchanged). There is a possibility that a person interacting with another person on a particular social network might not interact with the same person on another. If a person interacts with a large number of people and has more than average information exchange, capturing that person’s attention to a product can help reduce advertisement costs. It is because if that person likes a product, he/she will do the free advertisement to his/her friends. Each social network platform privately stores the interaction information due to privacy concerns. However, without the knowledge of the entire graph, it will be hard to learn the amount of interaction among individuals over the global graph. Thus, our algorithm solves this problem using the federated learning approach.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Proposed Approach</h2>

<div id="Sx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we eliminate the drawback of privacy concerns in distributed spectral clustering by generating the eigenvector embedding of the global graph without revealing raw data to the server. Our first approach is the baseline - <span id="Sx4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral</span> algorithm. Here, the clients create the spectral clustering labels of the local graph data. The server receives these clustering labels, which further creates the similarity graph by aggregating the clusterings. While there is no exchange of raw information between any clients, the algorithm doesn’t consider the relation of particular pair of nodes within two different clients. Due to this, the output clustering significantly deviates from the global clustering. To overcome this, we proposed the <span id="Sx4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span> approach that uses the power iteration method to generate the client’s eigenvector embeddings, which also considers the information from all other local clients by utilizing the aggregated result of the server.
This global aggregation helps us to learn the overall graph structure. Thus this approach preserves privacy and produces significantly better clustering than the baseline.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Spectral clustering needs the entire graph to be kept in a single memory, which limits the method’s use. However, sharing raw graph data with the global server and other clients raises privacy problems. The baseline - <span id="Sx4.SSx4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral</span> technique ignores the primary idea of spectral clustering that an embedding should be constructed using the knowledge of the entire graph rather than sections of graphs within individual clients. This is because a particular node in two separate client datasets can have a different vector embedding. As a result, we are unable to employ the method of calculating spectral embedding individually for each client. We need to find a way to aggregate the eigenvector embedding of clients to learn the representation of the entire graph. In addition, we also need the approach to achieve the former without sharing information about the presence of an edge within the data of a local client. Therefore, in this approach, we use the power iteration method to iteratively learn the eigenvector embedding of the global graph while preventing the exchange of edge data amongst the clients and server.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this approach, we want to learn the embedding as close as possible to the global embedding. The clients initially learn the local embedding using the power iteration method over their Laplacian matrix and send it to the server. Now, the server aggregates(averages) all the embeddings from the local clients and calls this the approximate embedding. The server then sends this approximate embedding to the clients. The client repeats the power iteration method using this learned approximate embedding to incorporate the local graph structure. Here, each node relates to the neighboring nodes of the other clients using approximate embedding. Thus, it gives the impression that we are learning the embedding by incorporating the features of the entire graph. As the number of aggregation rounds increases, the approximate embedding becomes nearer to the global embedding since the global graph structure gets clearer at every step. In the proposed approach, the only exchange of information includes sending the approximate embedding between the server and the clients. Therefore, there is no direct sharing of raw information about the local graph data, maintaining privacy in our federated approach.

Our metric algorithm penalizes the similarity score for each pair of nodes if the pair lie in the same cluster in global clustering and lie in different clusters in global aggregated clustering. The similarity score ranges from 0 to 1. A higher similarity score represents that both the clustering are more similar.

We can observe that with higher graph overlap, the similarity increases in general. It is because the local embedding becomes more informative because of the availability of more information about the global graph. Therefore, in the aggregation step at the global server, the deviation in the local embeddings from different clients is smaller, resulting in better similarity.

We can see that as the number of clients increases, and if we keep the overlap of graph data within the clients to be fixed, then the similarity drops.

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, in this work, we proposed a state-of-the-art approach - <span id="Sx6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>, a novel algorithm for federated spectral clustering. We used the power iteration method to iteratively learn the eigenvector embedding of the global graph. As there is no exchange of raw data between clients and the server, the proposed approach overcomes the main issue of spectral clustering in the distributed setting by providing data privacy. We also give a detailed analysis of factors impacting the <span id="Sx6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSpectral+</span>. As validated from the experiments, the similarity of clustering obtained using the proposed approach was comparable to that of global clustering. Thus, proving the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The suggested approach was only evaluated for its performance. In the future, we plan to test how resilient our algorithm is against different adversarial attacks, such as inference and poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shen et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. We also intend to assess the possibility of a data breach while transmitting local updates to the server. To further strengthen data privacy, we will improve our method by combining it with differentially private algorithms and secured multiparty computation.</p>
