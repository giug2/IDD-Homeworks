<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">A key aspect of VQA models that are interpretable is their ability to ground their answers to relevant regions in the image. Current approaches with this capability rely on supervised learning and human annotated groundings to train attention mechanisms inside the VQA architecture. Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations specific for visual grounding is difficult and expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that we can effectively train a VQA architecture with grounding supervision that can be automatically obtained from available region descriptions and object annotations. We also show that our model trained with this mined supervision generates visual groundings that achieve a higher correlation with respect to manually-annotated groundings, meanwhile achieving state-of-the-art VQA accuracy.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are interested in the problem of visual question answering (VQA), where an algorithm is presented with an image and a question that is formulated in natural language and relates to the contents of the image. The goal of this task is to get the algorithm to correctly answer the question. The VQA task has recently received significant attention from the computer vision community, in particular because obtaining high accuracies would presumably require precise understanding of both natural language as well as visual stimuli. In addition to serving as a milestone towards visual intelligence, there are practical applications such as development of tools for the visually impaired.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of VQA is challenging due to the complex interplay between the language and visual modalities.
On one hand, VQA algorithms must be able to parse and interpret the input question, which is provided in natural language <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This may potentially involve understanding of nouns, verbs and other linguistic elements, as well as their visual significance. On the other hand, the algorithms must analyze the image to identify and recognize the visual elements relevant to the question. Furthermore, some questions may refer directly to the contents of the image, but may require external, common sense knowledge to be answered correctly.
Finally, the algorithms should generate a textual output in natural language that correctly answers the input visual question.
In spite of the recent research efforts to address these challenges, the problem remains largely unsolved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Interpretable VQA algorithms must ground their answer into image regions that are relevant to the question. In this paper, we aim at providing this ability by leveraging existing region descriptions and object annotations to construct grounding supervision automatically.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We are particularly interested in giving VQA algorithms the ability to identify the visual elements that are relevant to the question. In the VQA literature, such ability has been implemented by <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">attention</em> mechanisms. Such attention mechanisms generate a heatmap over the input image, which highlights the regions of the image that lead to the answer. These heatmaps are interpreted as groundings of the answer to the most relevant areas of the image. Generally, these mechanisms have either been considered as latent variables for which there is no supervision, or have been treated as output variables that receive direct supervision from human annotations. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have disadvantages. First, unsupervised training of attention tends to lead to models that cannot ground their decision in the image in a human interpretable manner. Second, supervised training of attention is difficult and expensive: human annotators may consider different regions to be relevant for the question at hand, which entails ambiguity and increased annotation cost. Our goal is to leverage the best of both worlds by providing VQA algorithms with interpretable grounding of their answers, without the need of direct and explicit manual annotation of attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From a practical point of view, as autonomous machines are increasingly finding real world applications, there is an increasing need to provide them with suitable capabilities to explain their decisions. However, in most applications, including VQA, current state-of-the-art techniques operate as black-box models that are usually trained using a discriminative approach. Similarly to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, in this work we show that, in the context of VQA, such approaches lead to internal representations that do not capture the underlying semantic relations between textual questions and visual information. Consequently, as we show in this work, current state-of-the-art approaches for VQA are not able to support their answers with a suitable interpretable representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce a methodology that provides VQA algorithms with the ability to generate human interpretable attention maps which effectively ground the answer to the relevant image regions.
We accomplish this by leveraging region descriptions and object annotations available in the Visual Genome dataset, and using these to automatically construct attention maps that can be used for attention supervision, instead of requiring human annotators to manually provide grounding labels.
Our framework achieves competitive state-of-the-art VQA performance, while generating visual groundings that outperform other algorithms that use human annotated attention during training.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The contributions of this paper are:
(1) we introduce a mechanism to automatically obtain meaningful attention supervision from both region descriptions and object annotations in the Visual Genome dataset;
(2) we show that by using the prediction of region and object label attention maps as auxiliary tasks in a VQA application, it is possible to obtain more interpretable intermediate representations.
(3) we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performances in VQA benchmarks as well as visual grounding that closely matches human attention annotations.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since its introduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the VQA
problem has attracted an increasing interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Its multimodal
nature and more precise evaluation protocol than alternative multimodal scenarios, such as image
captioning, help to explain this interest. Furthermore, the proliferation of suitable
datasets and potential applications, are also key elements behind this increasing activity. Most state-of-the-art methods follow a joint embedding approach,
where deep models are used to project the textual question and visual input to a joint feature space
that is then used to build the answer. Furthermore, most modern approaches pose VQA as a
classification problem, where classes correspond to a set of pre-defined candidate
answers. As an example, most entries to
the VQA challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> select as output classes the most common 3000 answers in this
dataset, which account for 92% of the instances in the validation set.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The strategy to combine the
textual and visual embeddings and the underlying structure of the deep model are key design aspects that differentiate previous works.
Antol et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> propose an element-wise multiplication between image and
question embeddings to generate spatial attention map. Fukui et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> propose multimodal
compact bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently implement an outer product operator that
combines visual and textual representations. Yu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> extend this pooling scheme by introducing a multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling approach (MFB) that improves the representational capacity of the bilinear operator. They achieve this by adding an initial step that efficiently expands the textual and visual embeddings to a high-dimensional space. In terms of structural innovations, Noh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> embed the textual question as an intermediate dynamic bilinear layer of a ConvNet that processes the visual information. Andreas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> propose a model that learns a set of task-specific neural modules that are jointly trained to answer visual questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Following the successful introduction of soft attention in neural
machine translation applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, most modern VQA methods also incorporate a
similar mechanism. The common approach is to use a one-way attention scheme, where the embedding of
the question is used to generate a set of attention coefficients over a set of predefined image
regions. These coefficients are then used to weight the embedding of the image regions to obtain
a suitable descriptor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. More
elaborated forms of attention has also been proposed. Xu and Saenko <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> suggest use word-level embedding to generate attention. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>
iterates the application of a soft-attention mechanism over the visual input as a way to
progressively refine the location of relevant cues to answer the question. Lu et al.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes a bidirectional co-attention mechanism that
besides the question guided visual attention, also incorporates a visual guided attention over the input question.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In all the previous cases, the attention mechanism is applied using an unsupervised scheme, where
attention coefficients are considered as latent variables. Recently, there have been also interest
on including a supervised attention scheme to the VQA problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Das et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> compare the image areas selected by humans and state-of-the-art VQA techniques to
answer the same visual question. To achieve this, they collect the VQA human attention
dataset (VQA-HAT), a large dataset of human attention maps built by asking humans to select images areas relevant to answer questions from the VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Interestingly, this study
concludes that current machine-generated attention maps exhibit a poor correlation with respect to
the human counterpart, suggesting that humans use different visual cues to answer the questions. At a more fundamental level, this suggests that the discriminative nature of most current VQA
systems does not effectively constraint the attention modules, leading to the encoding of discriminative cues instead of the underlying semantic that relates a given question-answer pair. Our findings in this work support this hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Related to the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Gan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> apply a more
structured approach to identify the image areas used by humans to answer visual questions.
For VQA pairs associated to images in the COCO dataset, they ask humans to select the
segmented areas in COCO images that are relevant to answer each question. Afterwards, they use these
areas as labels to train a deep learning model that is able to identify attention features. By
augmenting a standard VQA technique with these attention features, they are able to achieve a small
boost in performance. Closely related to our approach, Qiao et al.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> use the attention labels in the VQA-HAT dataset to train an
attention proposal network that is able to predict image areas relevant to answer a visual question. This network generates a set of attention proposals for each image in the VQA dataset, which are used as labels to supervise attention in the VQA model.
This strategy results in a small boost in performance compared with a non-attentional strategy. In contrast to our approach, these previous works are based on a supervised attention scheme that does not consider an automatic mechanism to obtain the attention labels. Instead, they rely on human annotated groundings as attention supervision. Furthermore, they differ from our work in the method to integrate attention labels to a VQA model.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Genome (VG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> includes the largest VQA dataset currently available, which consists of 1.7M QA pairs. Furthermore, for each of its more than 100K images, VG also provides
region and object annotations by means of bounding boxes. In terms of visual grounding,
these region and object annotations provide complementary information. As an example, as shown in
Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Mining Attention Supervision from Visual Genome ‣ Interpretable Visual Question Answering by Visual Grounding from Attention Supervision Mining" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, for questions related to interaction between
objects, region annotations result highly relevant. In contrast, for questions related
to properties of specific objects, object annotations result more valuable. Consequently, in this
section we present a method to automatically select region and object annotations from VG that can
be used as labels to implement visual grounding as an auxiliary task for VQA.</p>

<p id="S5.p3.9" class="ltx_p">This is motivated by the fact that the visual grounding labels have some level of subjectivity. As an example, Figure <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 6.2 Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Interpretable Visual Question Answering by Visual Grounding from Attention Supervision Mining" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (second row) shows a case where the learned attention seems more accurate than the VQA-HAT ground truth. Hence, as the model learns suitable parameter values, we gradually loose the penalty on the attention maps to provide more freedom to the model to selectively decide what attention to use. It is important to note that,

VQA-X dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> contains 2000 labeled attention maps in VQA-2.0 validation sets. In contrast to VQA-HAT, VQA-X attention maps are in the form of instance segmentations, where annotators were asked to segment objects and/or regions that most prominently justify the answer. Hence the attentions are more specific and localized.

Specifically, we denote by Attn-* our adaptation of the respective model by including our Attention Supervision Module. We highlight that MCB model is the winner of VQA challenge 2016 and MFH model is the best single model in VQA challenge 2017. In Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 6.2 Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Interpretable Visual Question Answering by Visual Grounding from Attention Supervision Mining" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we can observe that our proposed model achieves a significantly boost on rank-correlation with respect to human attention. Furthermore, our model outperforms alternative state-of-art techniques in terms of accuracy in answer prediction. Specifically, the rank-correlation for MFH model increases by 36.4% when is evaluated in VQA-HAT dataset and 7.7% when is evaluated in VQA-X. This indicates that our proposed methods enable VQA models to provide more meaningful and interpretable results by generating more accurate visual grounding.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we have proposed a new method that is able to slightly outperform current state-of-the-art VQA systems, while also providing interpretable representations in the form of an explicitly trainable visual attention mechanism. Specifically, as a main result, our experiments provide evidence that the generated visual groundings achieve high correlation with respect to human-provided attention annotations, outperforming the correlation scores of previous works by a large margin.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As further contributions, we highlight two relevant insides of the proposed approach. On one side, by using attention labels as an auxiliary task, the proposed approach demonstrates that is able to constraint the internal representation of the model in such a way that it fosters the encoding of interpretable representations of the underlying relations between the textual question and input image. On other side, the proposed approach demonstrates a method to leverage existing datasets with region descriptions and object labels to effectively supervise the attention mechanism in VQA applications, avoiding costly human labeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As future work, we believe that the superior visual grounding provided by the proposed method can play a relevant role to generate natural language explanations to justify the answer to a given visual question. This scenario will help to demonstrate the relevance of our technique as a tool to increase the capabilities of AI based technologies to explain their decisions.</p>
