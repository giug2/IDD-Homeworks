<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and federated learning (FL) in smart transportation has raised critical issues regarding their responsible use. Ensuring responsible AI is paramount for the stability and sustainability of intelligent transportation systems. Despite its importance, research on the responsible application of AI and FL in this domain remains nascent, with a paucity of in-depth investigations into their confluence. Our study analyzes the roles of FL in smart transportation, as well as the promoting effect of responsible AI on distributed smart transportation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges of developing and implementing responsible FL in smart transportation and propose potential solutions. By integrating responsible AI and federated learning, intelligent transportation systems are expected to achieve a higher degree of intelligence, personalization, safety, and transparency.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the 2016 paper “Concrete Problems in AI Safety,” Dario Amodei raised concerns about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These concerns were later reflected in Google’s 2018 AI Principles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which aimed to promote ethical practices in the field of AI. However, as AI becomes more widely used, its ethical, legal, and social implications have become a more pressing concern for a wide range of stakeholders, including technicians, policymakers, ethicists, and the general public.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The advent of responsible AI responds to these issues, striving to align AI’s development and deployment with ethical and legal tenets. This paradigm extends beyond technicalities to encompass ethical considerations and the human element in AI’s decision-making, with an overarching intent to enhance human welfare. Microsoft’s 2022 Responsible AI Standard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> epitomizes this ethos, offering a framework rooted in six fundamental tenets: fairness, reliability, security, privacy, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability, guiding AI’s evolution towards ethical congruence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Achieving responsible AI requires collaborative efforts of various stakeholders. Ethicists play a crucial role in formulating ethical principles and guidelines to guide the development and use of AI. Policymakers must establish appropriate regulations and policies that govern the use of AI technologies. Technicians should develop AI systems that are transparent, fair, and explainable. Most importantly, the public must be informed and involved in the decision-making processes surrounding AI technologies to ensure that the technology aligns with community interests and dignity.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a trusted AI paradigm that enables secure and efficient collaborative computation among multiple participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This approach allows multiple participants to train AI models collectively without sharing their raw data, thereby safeguarding data privacy and confidentiality. Each participant in FL retains ownership of its dataset and conducts local model training. The results of the local training are then uploaded to a central server, which performs model aggregation and updating. FL enables vehicles to train models without compromising data privacy while improving the accuracy and generalization of smart transportation models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There is a growing need for responsible AI and FL in smart transportation.
