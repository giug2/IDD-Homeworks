<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">With the ever increasing data deluge and the success of deep neural networks, the research of distributed deep learning has become pronounced. Two common approaches to achieve this distributed learning is synchronous and asynchronous weight update. In this manuscript, we have explored very simplistic synchronous weight update mechanisms. Our motivation is that when multiple models in the nodes are trained on different parts of the data, and the aggregated weight update is performed in the main parameter server, it behaves like an ensemble system or a social learning system. Such a combination of multiple classifiers can handle data complexity very well and supersede a single sophisticated classifier. However, it has been observed that in a parallel setting, this fact is falsified if one uses a synchronous weight update mechanism with simple averaging at the parameter server. It has been seen that with an increasing number of worker nodes, the performance degrades drastically. This effect has been studied in the context of extreme imbalanced classification (e.g. outlier detection). For most distributed DL methods, it is assumed that the worker servers (or local servers) hold independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. However, in practical cases, the conditions of i.i.d. may not be fulfilled. There may also arise global class imbalance situations like that of outlier detection where the local servers receive severely imbalanced data and may not get any samples from the minority class. In that case, the DNNs in the local servers will get completely biased towards the majority class that they receive. This would highly impact the learning at the parameter server (which practically does not see any data). It has been observed that in a parallel setting if one uses the existing federated weight update mechanisms at the parameter server, the performance degrades drastically with the increasing number of worker nodes. This is mainly because, with the increasing number of nodes, there is a high chance that one worker node gets a very small portion of the data, either not enough to train the model without overfitting or having a highly imbalanced class distribution. The chapter, hence, proposes a workaround to this problem by introducing the concept of adaptive cost-sensitive momentum averaging. It is seen that for the proposed system, there was no to minimal degradation in performance while most of the other methods hit their bottom performance before that.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is witnessed that AEs have been useful in extracting meaningful feature representations for datasets with imbalanced class distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Thus, it is intriguing to study how the problem extends to decentralised data settings. AEs have an innate ability to capture the outlier features. Now, the question arises whether the AE pre-initialisation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> given to a DNN adds any further improvement to the capability of learning from imbalanced datasets. DNNs are inherently biased by the majority class and often fail to give good performance if the classes are severely imbalanced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This problem is a big limitation when it comes to achieving high classification performances as compared to balanced classification tasks where DL thrives. DL in distributed setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a boon for the current times when we are facing the data deluge. Reports show that human beings have generated more data in just the last decade than have been produced over the last hundred years. This astonishing fact is seen as the foundation for several experiments of concurrent and distributed computation and distributed methodologies in computer science education. Distributed computation is a necessity of this age and it is the pinnacle of this area of science to combine it with sophisticated learning approaches such as DL (neural nets). However, distributed DL in an imbalanced scenario is a big gap that needs to be addressed. If the distributed model uses non-independent and non-identical (or simply non-i.i.d) chunks of data in each local computation server, the imbalance becomes critical and often too overwhelming for a DNN to handle. This is, however, a paradox as multiple experts are being used to model the classification boundary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This may be viewed as an extension of the concepts of using multiple classifiers to obtain a better classification performance. Such a setting is often regarded as Social Learning System (SLS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> or an Ensemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> or a Multi-Classifier System (MCS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. This is due to the complementary nature of each of the classifier in the SLS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This diversity is usually achieved either through diversity in data or diversity in models. Deep neural networks under such ensemble setting have been proven to give better performance than their single model counterparts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Perceiving that every independent classifier may make complementary errors, we can merge together the decisions from all classifiers to build a composite framework that outperforms any single classifier. Such a combination of multiple classifiers can handle data complexity very well and supersede a single sophisticated classifier. Owing to the training on different inputs, the pool of predictors is ensured to be highly diverse and mutually complementary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Borrowing the idea of these SLSs, it is expected that a distributed DL model should give better performance than their single model analogy. We can view this particular setting as an ensemble or a social learning system where multiple models in the nodes are trained on different parts of the data, and the aggregated weight update is performed in the main parameter server, it behaves like an SLS. This is also known as federated learning (FL). In the parameter server version of the distributed setting the data samples are spread through a variety of processing nodes and each node has one deep network. There is a parameter server that receives all the parameters (weights and biases) after each communication round, aggregates it and sends the updated aggregated weights to all the worker nodes for the next communication round to begin [Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>]. This method of weight update often results in decreased performance as the number of predictors increase. This is mostly due to the fact that the data distribution across the worker nodes are do not have identical distributions and might also have local class imbalance issues. DNNs being just and extension of the traditional neural networks suffer from masking and swamping effects. However, DNNs are state-of-the-art models for most classification tasks. This problem is aggravated if the actual data has an inherent global imbalance (as in case of outlier detection where the class imbalance is severe) and is so big that it needs a distributed processing. As DNNs are inherently unsuitable for the problem of such outlier detection, distributed models fail. However, as identified by many researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, AEs are better suited as outlier detection models. Thus, it would be interesting to see how the AE pre-initialised DNNs perform for outlier detection tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is even more intriguing to study how an AE pre-initialised distributed architecture of DNNs using a global weight update mechanism at the parameter server would handle the severely imbalanced datasets as with the outlier detection problem. The global data is itself severely imbalanced (outlier class constitute &lt;10% of the total samples) and thus the local datasets might be critically imbalanced (some may have negligible percentage or completely losing samples from the minority class). Here arises the Hace’s theorem of Big Data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> when the data is not globally available to all the worker nodes, each of the nodes train independently over any arbitrary portion of the data and make predictions on that.</p>

The parameter server does not contain any data for training. Training is only done in the worker nodes. Each worker node has one deep neural network (DNN) model and a portion of the entire dataset and all the neural networks of each worker node have identical architectures. The idea of FL is that each of the worker nodes do not reveal their local datasets to each other. This property is quite useful in scenarios where data privacy preservation is important among collaborating nodes. The parameter server has as an identical deep neural network only for storing the final updated parameters after each communication round. The basic assumption for such FL implementations are that the data division across the worker nodes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional method, known as federated averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> works simply by averaging all the respective parameters from the worker nodes. This method works well in cases of i.i.d data sample division across worker nodes and is highly scalable. However, for non-i.i.d setting, this method fails as the number of worker nodes increase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Moreover, scenarios of class imbalance introduce saturation problem for neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The non-i.i.d nature of data sample distribution and class imbalance across worker nodes are practical issues and may arise if the local datasets at each worker node come from mostly (or completely) one particular class.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In that case, that particular local model never sees the samples from the minority class. The proposed method handles this intriguing situations when the data is distributed across the local workers such that, the total data is severely imbalanced (in case of under-represented class &lt;10%) and some of the local workers may not get any samples of the under-represented class. The present manuscript proposes an alternative by introducing a cost-sensitive momentum averaging scheme. The proposed method has been shown to handle these two problems better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The total size of the actual global dataset is constant. In order to get a severely imbalanced global data, we used some datasets with outliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> (one class had &lt;10% of the total samples). The number of samples each worker node receives is chosen carefully by clustering (details in section <a href="#S4" title="4 Proposed Method ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) to avoid human bias. Under such conditions, it has been seen that with increasing number of worker nodes, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods degrades drastically. This degradation is more pronounced when the data is already globally imbalanced. It has been observed that the proposed method is robust in handling the scenario. The manuscript, hence, proposes a workaround by introducing the concept of local cost-sensitive momentum averaging. It is seen that for the proposed system, there was minimal degradation in performance and was robust than the other methods.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, it is shown that AE pre-initialisation strategy works best for outlier detection tasks using a neural network when retraining is done by the focal loss function. Further, this article proposes an adaptive focal loss for learning from severely imbalanced datasets in distributed deep learning setting. In this context, critical class imbalance is explored. We argue that standard methods for federated learning fail to learn from severely imbalanced data and hence face a criticality issue. This is mostly due to either lesser number of samples at the local worker (which makes the local model overfit) or severely imbalanced partitions at the local worker such that most of the workers do not get a single sample from the minority class. We have shown that as the number of workers are increased, the homogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> of the local datasets also increase and tend to 1. If all the local datasets contain only a single class’ samples, then the homogeneity becomes 1. If the local datasets have perfectly identical representations of the classes as the global dataset then the homogeneity becomes zero. For any severely imbalanced dataset, the homogeneity is seen to increase with the number of workers. So, the assumption, that increasing number of workers result in situations where one or more local datasets have no samples from the minority class (or classes), holds true. So, the major contribution of this work is as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of critical class imbalance in federated deep learning has not been explored or handled in the literature to the best knowledge of the authors. This problem is inherently unique due to its complex nature and resembles a very practical situation (described in section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Division of Data Across Worker Nodes ‣ 4 Proposed Method ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>). The basic assumption of i.i.d data distribution across workers is violated in such cases and along with that, the severe class imbalance also affects the performance of the local model at each worker. Related studies have either assumed the data across workers to be i.i.d sampled or having imbalanced class. However, no method has handled the two issues simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There may be a criticism of the assumption that the number of samples in the global dataset is constant and that doesn’t make the comparison fair on the grounds of unequal number of samples for different number of nodes. Under that light, it needs to be explained that the aim of the experiment is to study a practical situation occurs where small chunks of data are generated by a number of remote devices and data privacy is a concern. The aim was to use the entire training data each time without making any inherent assumption of a local data chunk being more important than the other. This study is different than all the existing studies in this aspect too. The following section describes the related state-of-the art literature around FL.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The manuscript deals with the concepts of FL for classification using pre-trained fully connected deep neural networks. FL in DL is still in its pristine state. The collaborative learning mechanism is perfect for reaping the benefits of DL in distributed data settings. The era of Big Data and the expertise of DL algorithms have forced the researchers to devise novel ways to develop deep distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The solutions, however, are problem specific. In cases where the data is too big to be contained in a single machine, but the DL model can be trained in a single machine, the data is distributed and the model is replicated across different machines. Each of these machines perform local computations on the models and interact with each other directly or through a server to understand a global view of the data without transferring the data as a whole. This is called data-distribution architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In cases where the data is not so big, but the DL model has so many parameters that it cannot be trained in a single machine, the model is distributed and the data is replicated across different machines. This is called model-distribution architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In cases where both the data as well as the DL model is too big for a single machine, both the data as well as the model are distributed. This is known as hybrid-distribution architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

Each of the worker nodes train a local model on the local dataset that they contain and send the updates (change in weights of the local models) to the parameter server.

<p id="S3.p5.15" class="ltx_p">However, even though the method of FedAdp was capable of handling non-i.i.d data setting, it did not take into account cases of extreme imbalance. Moreover, for non-i.i.d data, the number of rounds needed to achieve a desired performance for 10 participating worker nodes were in the order of hundreds.</p>

<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another method of aggregation was introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> which could improve the performance of the worker models by allowing them to explore and fluctuate from the parameter’s center variables. They argued that since it is a collaborative learning strategy, there might be numerous local optima. The method is called Elastic Averaging (EASGD). In this method, the aggregated weight is a moving average of the local weights.</p>

<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">A detailed study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> on some of the methods for selecting some well-learnt workers to update the global model has been done in the context of imbalanced class distribution. However, such methods aim at discarding a number of workers which are supposedly not good-enough to contribute to the global model. In doing so, they are rejecting the data that the rejected workers hold and the global model does not get to learn from that particular portion of the data.</p>

<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have focussed on the problem with data imbalance across worker nodes and have proposed methods to overcome the challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. A self-balancing methodology known as Astraea is adapted such that the local datasets in each node is rebalanced by augmentation. However, such methods often work on augmenting the local datasets on workers with the minority class. Thus, have an inherent assumption that the local models have seen atleast some actual samples of the minority class. In cases when one or more local models are completely deprived of one or more classes, the problem cannot be handled by minority class data augmentation. Resampling is a popular method to alleviate the imbalance problem by undersampling or over-sampling. However, over-sampling usually is susceptible to errors owing to excess or additional noise, while undersampling lowers the volume of training data from which the model can learn. This makes the above two approaches useless.</p>

Focal loss has been directly applied to the federated learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. However, the method again focused more on selecting well learnt worker nodes rather than handling the imbalance in a direct fashion. A similar loss function called GHMC loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> (Gradient Harmonizing Mechanism Classification loss) is also proposed to handle outliers in a non-distributed setting. These methods can be straight-forwardly applied to federated learning setting as they consider imbalance of the current worker model. MFE loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is another cost-sensitive method that requires knowledge about the minority classes. It generates a modified form of loss using the false positives and false negatives. However, such a prior knowledge is impractical in FL. A new loss function called the Ratio Loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> has been proposed recently. The method incorporates a monitoring scheme at each communication round and keeps track of the local imbalance in the training data. However, this loss function again needs to identify the minority class in the global dataset as an added burden. Moreover, it is stated by the authors that as the global imbalance increases, the effective performance of the ratio loss degrades. If the global dataset itself poses an outlier detection problem (where the imbalance is severe i.e. the minority class is only 10% of the dataset), it will fail. Thus, a new loss function is proposed which would modify the local weights in such a manner that even critical imbalance is handled.</p>

<div id="S3.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, there is a dire need of an efficient method to handle extreme class imbalance in local nodes. Moreover, the exiting methods on handling class imbalance mostly use pre-trained models. Hence, it has never been studied how the pre-initialisation strategy would affect the learning process in such imbalanced data setting. Because the training data is consolidated in a centralised setting in typical training situations, there is no differentiation between local and global imbalance values. Thus, minimising the negative impact of imbalance is considerably easier than in the cases of decentralised data. It should be noted that in federated learning, each local model training might be considered as a regular centralised training. Intuitively, we might use the existing approaches to handle the local imbalance problem at each round. However, local models exist only momentarily on the local worker nodes and are replaced by the most recent global model after each training cycle. As a result, fixing local imbalances may have little influence. Furthermore, because of the misalignment between local and global imbalances, just implementing known procedures at local devices is often ineffective and may even have a detrimental influence on the global model. Thus, there needs to be a mechanism which can handle each of these local imbalances and the training would work on resolving the global imbalance. The proposed method aims to handle the afore-mentioned issues and also provides a boost in performance. The following section describes the proposed method in detail.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The manuscript studies situations where imbalanced data portions may degrade the individual classification ability of the worker nodes. A deep neural network is inherently unsuitable for imbalanced classification due to masking and swamping effects. Thus, researchers have proposed many methods to train a neural network using cost-sensitive backpropagation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. As the data is distributed across worker nodes, it becomes relatively difficult to handle the class imbalance. This work does not use any freely available pre-trained models. The local models are first pre-trained using an autoencoder and are then re-trained with class labels. So, each of the local models train over the data in two phases. Autoencoder pre-training is useful for class imbalance situation because the network gets biased towards learning the majority class’ features efficiently. So, any data that doesn’t fit into the description of the majority class may be picked up as an outlier easily <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The re-training is just done to learn the classification between the majority and minority classes.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The data is arbitrarily distributed and resembles a practical scenario where a user has no control over the number of samples each node gets. In both the cases, the datasets were partitioned and given to each worker node. Partitioning the data into non-overlapping portions makes the data across local workers ‘non-independent’. To remove the ‘identically-distributed’ assumption of i.i.d, the global data clustered and each cluster represented a partition of the dataset. For this, we used <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-means clustering where <math id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> is equal to the number of worker nodes. Thus, it was ensured that the local datasets that the worker nodes get are non-i.i.d. As the number of clusters grow (which is same as increasing the number of local workers), the probability of each cluster having samples from only a single class increases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Thus, as the number of local workers grow, there is an increased chance that the local datasets are mostly of a single class only. This method of data division is merely mimicking a practical data distribution scenario across the workers which assumes that the data generated at each local worker is mostly similar.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To understand the practical implication of this assumption, let us consider an example where there are two branches of a company located across two different locations in the world. It may happen that for one of the locations, the workers mostly relatively younger and for the other location the workers are mostly older. Thus, the first company can produce goods at a much faster rate with less errors while the second company produces goods at a slower pace and more errors than the first one. Thus, the data obtained from the first location will have more samples and majority of the samples will pass the quality check. On the other hand, the data from other location will have lesser samples and majority of the samples will not pass the quality check. So, if one attempts to learn the model of quality check from both the companies, he or she needs to learn in an imbalanced and distributed setting simultaneously.</p>

This would imply that more severe the imbalance a local model would face, the lesser it would deviate from the last global update, but the information would not be completely lost. This would help the global weights to not drift randomly. It can be proved that there would always atleast be one local data portion that will not have the severity in imbalance, and the model trained on that particular data would always govern the global weights. However, that model alone is not enough to learn the entire data space. So, the other models which are inflicted with severe imbalance would add the fine tuning to the global weights accordingly.</p>

It induces an elastic force that does not allow the local model’s weight matrix to deviate too much from the global weight matrix whereas also allowing some independence. The proposed method incorporates the concept of EASGD with the proposed adaptive focal loss [equation <a href="#S4.E15" title="In 4.2 Cost-sensitive Neural Network Training ‣ 4 Proposed Method ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>].

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While pre-training the network, since there are no class labels involved, and the models merely learn to reconstruct the input, the unnecessary involvement of the adaptive cost-sensitive loss function is not needed. So, the autoencoders are trained by the standard EASGD (equation <a href="#S3.E12" title="In 3 Related Works ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>) to minimise the reconstructional mean squared error loss. Now, for the retraining, the model must learn the discrimination between classes even in presence of severe class imbalance. So, retraining needs the cost-sensitive loss function along with EASGD. The cost-sensitive adaptive focal loss function determines how much independence the individual local model would get in determining the optimum weights depending on the class imbalance they witness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The pre-training without cost-sensitivity allows the autoencoders to distinguish between the majority and the minority classes. It has been proven that autoencoders map similar values to similar ranges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and thus for classification in such severe imbalanced datasets, they are very useful. Autoencoders are extensively employed in outlier identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where an input with a substantial reconstruction error is identified as out-of-distribution, as the quality of reconstruction is expected to decrease for inputs that are considerably different from majority of the training data. The traditional AE-based pre-training is also favoured since it is highly stable and simple, as well as providing a decent initialisation to begin with. So, the retraining is to just fine tune the local models according to the proportion of the different classes present in the local dataset.</p>

We have chosen eight binary-class outlier detection datasets for this purpose which had the outlier class samples representing less than 10% of the total dataset. The description of the datasets are provided in table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5 Experiments and Results ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>].</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The initialization phase is essential to the model’s eventual output and mandates an effective approach. Traditionally, weight initialization entailed employing smaller random values (close to zero). However, over the last decade, better explicit heuristics that utilise network architecture information, for example, the type of activation being utilised or the number of inputs to the network, have been developed. These rather specific strategies can lead to more successful neural network model construction when using the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. This optimization procedure necessitates a starting point in the universe of possible weight values wherein the optimization may commence. Deep model training is a challenging enough process that the initialization method used has a significant impact on most techniques. The starting point can decide whether or not the process converges at all, with certain initial values being so unstable that the algorithm runs into numerical challenges and fails entirely. Many initialisation strategies are gradually developed. Some popular methods used these days are Random Normal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Random Uniform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Xavier-Glorot Normal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Xavier-Glorot Uniform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, He Normal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and He Uniform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. AEs were also proposed as a pre-initialisation strategy to avoid the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. While techniques like AE pre-training certainly laid the groundwork for many essential principles in today’s deep learning methodologies, the compelling necessity for pre-training neural networks has waned in recent times. This was largely due to various advancements in regularisation, network architectures, and enhanced optimization methods. Despite these advancements, training deep neural networks to generalise well to a wide range of complicated tasks remains a major issue. One of these is the issue of imbalanced datasets. Neural networks get biased towards the majority class. However, AEs are well suited for outlier detection tasks. Hence, in order to strengthen the position of AE pre-training in outlier detection tasks, it was compared with the popular initialisation strategies. The models use various initialisation schemes and the training for classification is done using the focal loss function [equation <a href="#S3.E13" title="In 3 Related Works ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>] (because for a single model, the equations <a href="#S3.E13" title="In 3 Related Works ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> and <a href="#S4.E15" title="In 4.2 Cost-sensitive Neural Network Training ‣ 4 Proposed Method ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a> are identical). Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 How Pre-initialisation affects Outlier Detection? ‣ 5 Experiments and Results ‣ Improving the Robustness of Federated Learning for Severely Imbalanced Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> gives a comparison of how the various initialisations perform for severely imbalanced datasets (where the minority class has less than 10% representation) with respect to all the four metrics namely ROC-AUC (Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, F-Score <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, DR (Detection Rate) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and G-Mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. It can be seen that AE pre-training added an advantage to the performance of a deep neural network for all the eight datasets under consideration.</p>

It can be seen that several models were not performing well in the initial rounds. Models 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 were only capable of detecting the samples from the majority class after the first round. However, due to the learning obtained from the other well performing models, they gradually shifted to a better performance in classifying the samples. This clearly indicates that even though there are some under-performing models in the learner pool, the global model will not be so severely affected by it and there will be a gradual learning eventually.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under the above conditions, another important aspect is to study how the increasing number of worker nodes affect the overall performance of the global model. In the case presented, the total data is always constant and each worker gets a unique partition of the dataset. Thus, as the number of worker nodes increase, the number of samples in each worker node will decrease. So, increasing the number of workers above a certain limit is not possible so as to prevent the unlikely condition of models getting insufficient samples for training. It has been seen that all the existing methods tend to be biased towards the majority class as the number of workers grow. It is noteworthy that increasing the number of workers in the present assumption of experiments that the data samples are partitioned (i.e. increasing the number of workers would decrease the number of samples in each partition), not having an enough quantity of the data in each worker node will be an inevitable cause of performance degradation. Hence, the study mainly shows that the proposed method yields a consistent performance with increasing worker nodes while the existing methods hit a saturation point after a certain limit. The proposed method has been compared with the existing methods used for outlier detection in federated learning: EASGD (with cross-entropy loss) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, Astraea<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FedFocal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and Ratio Loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As observed from the above experiments, the outlier detection abilities of EASGD (with cross-entropy loss) suffers a fast degradation with increasing number of nodes. Astraea improved on the detection abilities but with increasing number of nodes, showed incompetence. The Ratio Loss method and the method FedFocal were more or less similar in performance and were able to detect outliers fairly upto an appreciable number of nodes before suffering failure. The proposed method had the best performance among all the methods and the performance was more or less steady with increasing number of nodes and was still able to detect outliers while all the detection abilities of the other existing methods already collapsed. There was a gradual decrease in the performance of the proposed method for some datasets due to the lack of enough training samples in each local partition with the increasing number of nodes. This is an expected consequence of our assumption that the total number of samples in the global dataset is constant.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article it has been shown that AE pre-training is better for outlier detection tasks. The study is then extended to the use of AE pre-training in distributed setting. In this context an adaptive version of focal loss function is introduced to handle the critical imbalance in the distributed data setting. The main assumptions in the experiments were that the data available at each local node is mutually exclusive. If one local node fails, it is assumed that there is a backup node for each local node which would continue with the learning process. Under such assumptions, it has been observed that the proposed method can handle the critical imbalance better than the existing methods. The experiments show that even when some local datasets did not have any samples from the outlier class, the proposed method drove the global model and each of the local models to similar performance on the test data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, there might arise an extreme case of imbalance where one local model may contain a lot of outlier samples such that the outlier class becomes the majority for that particular local dataset and all the other local datasets do not contain any outlier sample at all. In that case, the present solution might not work as it relies on the outlier ratio. Such an extreme case would practically imply that all the anomalies are generated at the same location while others do not generate any at all. This problem needs to be handled in a different light and has been set aside as a direction of future research. The research may also be extended to handle multiple classes where the local imbalance is critical and the global imbalance may or may not be present.</p>
