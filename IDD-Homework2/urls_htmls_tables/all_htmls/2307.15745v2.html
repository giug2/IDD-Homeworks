<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) has the potential to make the Internet more accessible in an interactive way, allowing people who cannot see images to ask questions about them. However, multiple studies have shown that people who are blind or have low-vision prefer image explanations that incorporate the context in which an image appears, yet current VQA datasets focus on images in isolation. We argue that VQA models will not fully succeed at meeting people’s needs unless they take context into account. To further motivate and analyze the distinction between different contexts, we introduce Context-VQA<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>More details about the dataset and code are available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nnaik39/context-vqa" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/nnaik39/context-vqa</a>.</span></span></span>, a VQA dataset that pairs images with contexts, specifically types of websites (e.g., a shopping website). We find that the types of questions vary systematically across contexts. For example, images presented in a travel context garner 2 times more “Where?” questions, and images on social media and news garner 2.8 and 1.8 times more “Who?” questions than the average. We also find that context effects are especially important when participants can’t see the image. These results demonstrate that context affects the types of questions asked and that VQA models should be context-sensitive to better meet people’s needs, especially in accessibility settings.</p>

On a social media website, the details about people within the image are more relevant, while in the context of a shopping website, people will want to know more specific details about the suitcase.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Images are omnipresent on the Web, appearing in various contexts—for example, news websites, shopping websites, or social media <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. This poses an issue for nonvisual accessibility: How will people who cannot see the image (e.g., due to image loading issues or a visual impairment) understand the content that is presented? In this case, a textual interpretation of the image is needed.
While much recent work has focused on leveraging AI to generate image descriptions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, being able to inquire about specific details gives the user agency over obtaining information that is specifically suited to their needs (which is, for example, leveraged in interactive accessibility studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>).
Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are a promising tool for providing image-based information on the fly. However, most VQA efforts are focused on evaluating machine “understanding,” an abstract task which seeks to test the spatial or object reasoning of machine learning models.
The resulting systems aren’t easily extendable to an accessibility application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The VizWiz dataset is an exception, where image–question pairs are obtained from the actual use case of blind and low-vision people asking questions about information in the visual world they’re taking pictures of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to traditional machine understanding VQA datasets, we propose Context-VQA, a dataset which recenters the focus on the use case of image accessibility and the changing information needs for images occurring in various sources online. Context-VQA complements VizWiz but is distinct from it, since the images are part of the general public discourse and not directly conditioned on a question.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Current VQA tasks assume a one-size-fits-all approach, where each image is associated with a fixed set of questions.
However, recent work suggests that different pieces of information become relevant depending on the particular context in which people encountered the image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Consider the question and answer provided in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Context-VQA: Towards Context-Aware and Purposeful Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. It is difficult to infer the context from the image itself, yet the meaning of the image changes depending on the context. Our Context-VQA dataset presents images in distinct contexts to elicit more naturalistic question distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of the Context-VQA dataset is to align previous VQA efforts with an explicit accessibility goal, and to situate questions and answers within diverse Web contexts
to more closely reflect user needs.
Each entry consists of a question, image, answer, and context, where the question and answer are both conditioned upon the context. We find that context shapes which questions become informative and that this contextual sensitivity is even more pronounced when participants are prompted to ask questions based on a description of the image and not the ground-truth image itself. This suggests that specifically in cases of image inaccessibility, the context plays a major role for VQA tasks.</p>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Making image content accessible through textual descriptions and explanations requires selecting pieces of visual information that appear most relevant.
This has been a focus of investigation specifically for the usefulness of image descriptions.
Traditionally, generating image descriptions takes a one-size-fits-all approach, where a single description is used across many different contexts. However, there is a growing consensus that people’s information needs for the same image changes depending on the context where the image appears <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For example, while people prefer details about the color and attributes of the clothing on shopping websites, information about the relationships between people depicted in the image become more relevant in the context of social media. Furthermore, users also want image descriptions to clarify why the image appears on a site <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In an interactive image accessibility study between a BLV and a sighted user, this context dependence was also observable from the specific questions the BLV participant asked about the images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, suggesting that context needs to play a role not just for image descriptions but also VQA systems.</p>

Similarly, the questions in Context-VQA were generated from giving study participants image descriptions and asking them to write follow-up questions. Where Context-VQA diverges from Visual Dialog, however, is the incorporation of context into the dataset, which moves away from a one-size-fits-all approach
and towards reflecting the variety of questions asked for contextually situated images.</p>

All the images and the questions in VizWiz come from blind people who had a question about something in their environment, took a picture, and uploaded it to the VizWiz app along with their question, where crowdsourced human workers then provided an answer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For instance, someone might take an image of the error message on their rebooting computer screen or a clothing item of which they want to know the color.
In VizWiz, the images are taken to explicitly answer a single question. However, the images that need to be made accessible online are often intended to meet multiple information needs in varied contexts.
Thus,
Context-VQA addresses a separate image accessibility purpose than VizWiz and complements that effort.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal for the Context-VQA dataset is to allow for a direct comparison of how questions for images change based on
image context.
To do so, we collected naturalistic images from six different types of websites, which were selected based on prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
In a norming study, participants were presented with an image and, for each of the six contexts, rated how likely it was that the image appeared in the given context. We used this study to select plausible image-context pairs that were further annotated with questions (Experiment 1) and answers (Experiment 2). All human-subject experiments were run on the crowdsourcing platform Prolific
under an IRB protocol.</p>

There were two versions of the question generation task: description-only and image+description.
In the description-only task, participants were given a context and an image description generated by BLIP-2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In the image+description version, participants were additionally shown the image itself. As an annotation quality check, we first asked them to write a justification for why the image might appear in the given context—low-effort or incomprehensible justifications resulted in data exclusion. They were then asked to suggest two follow-up questions that a person who only had access to the image description would ask. Prior work has noted that having the questioner not see the image could help remove visual priming bias–for example, questioners will often write, “Is there a dog in this image?” only if there is a dog in the image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

These results can help provide insight into where a model must be especially robust, and they highlight the importance of systems that can adjust to contextually changing user needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While some context effects are reflected in the image+description study (e.g., in the <em id="S4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">where</em> and <em id="S4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how</em> distributions), they are overall less pronounced than in the description-only study.
We hypothesize this is because the questioners have less information in the description-only study to inform their questions. These results suggest that context-sensitivity in VQA needs to play an especially important role when the image itself isn’t visible to the end user, and is therefore particularly relevant for the image accessibility setting. Image+description VQA study setups might provide misleading results, since the presence of the image dampens the context effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Prior work suggests that when questioners don’t see the image, they ask longer and more open-ended questions, which necessitates more detailed answers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The average response length for our answers, across question types and study conditions, ended up being 11.03 words. This shows that the answers in our dataset are meaningful and not restricted to binary responses. This is an uncommonly long average response length for VQA datasets–for a point of comparison, Visual Dialog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> reported an average answer length of 2.9 words, which was still higher than VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> (1.1 words), and Visual 7W <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> (2.0 words). We hypothesize the main contributors to answer length are expressions of uncertainty or additional details.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present the Context-VQA dataset and use it to show how context changes the distribution of question types for VQA models. Unlike previous VQA datasets, Context-VQA is context-sensitive and reflects the distribution of question types that people will ask in different contexts. We also show initial evidence that the questions vary across contexts, especially when the image can’t be seen.</p>
