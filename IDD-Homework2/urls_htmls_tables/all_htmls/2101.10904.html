<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm in Machine Learning (ML) that addresses data privacy, security, access rights and access to heterogeneous information issues by training a global model using distributed nodes. Despite its advantages, there is an increased potential for cyberattacks on FL-based ML techniques that can undermine the benefits. Model-poisoning attacks on FL target the availability of the model. The adversarial objective is to disrupt the training. We propose attestedFL, a defense mechanism that monitors the training of individual nodes through state persistence in order to detect a malicious <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span>. A fine-grained assessment of the history of the <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> permits the evaluation of its behavior in time and results in innovative detection strategies. We present three lines of defense that aim at assessing if the <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> is reliable by observing if the node is truly training, while advancing towards a goal. Our defense exposes an attacker’s malicious behavior and removes unreliable nodes from the aggregation process so that the FL process converge faster.
attestedFL increased the accuracy of the model in different FL settings, under different attacking patterns, and scenarios e.g., attacks performed at different stages of the convergence, colluding attackers, and continuous attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has started to transform a number of industries. This new paradigm in Machine Learning (ML) addresses critical issues such as data privacy, access rights, security, and access to heterogeneous information by training a global model using distributed nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The approach stands in contrast to the traditional centralized ML techniques, where all data samples are uploaded to a single server, as well as to more classical decentralized approaches, the local data samples are assumed to be identically distributed. Without the need for data sharing, FL trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized nodes that hold their local data samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advantages and successful application of FL in certain industry-based cases, there is an increased potential for cyberattacks on this ML technique, which can seriously undermine its benefits. In fact, by design, FL requires frequent communication between nodes during the learning process to be able to exchange the parameters of the ML model. This represents an attack surface from which an attacker can exploit system vulnerabilities to gain access to the learning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the cybersecurity of FL, the poisoning attack is an attack type that takes advantage of the ML model during training. Some poisoning attacks target the model integrity (backdoor attacks), while others target the ML model availability. In the first category, also known as targeted attacks, a backdoor is inserted so that the model’s boundary shifts in some way as to include the malicious training data, thus compromising the integrity of the model. In fact, FL raises the challenge that hiding training data allows the attackers to inject backdoors into the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For instance, the attacks can modify an image classifier so that it assigns an attacker-chosen label to images with certain features, or force a word predictor to complete certain sentences with an attacker-chosen word <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the category of poisoning attacks that target the ML model availability also known as untargeted attacks, the aim is to generate poisoned local model updates to inject into the system so that the parameters that the global model learns become essentially useless. Model poisoning exploits the fact that FL gives malicious nodes direct and unrestricted influence over the global model. In fact, each round of the iterative process consists of training local models on local nodes to produce a set of potential model updates at each node. Thus, an attacker can impact the weights in the global model so that the new learned model never converges on the federated learning task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the gamification process of attacks and defenses against untargeted attacks, many known defenses have shown that robust aggregators are provably effective under appropriate assumptions at mitigating untargeted attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, Fang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a directed deviation attack that multiple aggregators did little to defend against. The existing defenses leave a margin for poisoning since the theoretical guarantees of these defenses may only hold under assumptions on the learning problem that are often not met <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Pan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a defense where a reinforcement learning agent learns, from the updates provided by <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> and the relative decrease of loss as its reward, to propose the weight update of the global model at each iteration. In the approach, each coordinate of the learned policy is interpreted as the current credit on the corresponding node and attests to the reliability of the <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span>. The authors proposed a detection technique, which consists in removing unreliable nodes at every iteration based only on the credits in the learned policy sequence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the open challenge to protect against untargeted attacks, in this work, we conduct an extensive detection and behavioral pattern analysis and propose <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">attestedFL</em>, a defense mechanism that protects the system and can restore robustness in adversarial settings. While the untargeted attack tries to decrease the convergence of the model, attestedFL studies the behavior of the <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> over time through state persistence and removes unreliable nodes from the aggregation process so that the FL process converge faster. This results in innovative detection strategies.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on the most common implementation of federated learning algorithms i.e. the data-parallel distributed learning system with one node acting as the <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> and a set of nodes acting as <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span>. Although federated learning enables nodes to construct a machine learning model without sharing their private training data with each other, the fact that the <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> has no visibility into how the model updates are generated represents a major vulnerability in the process. Attacks exploit this vulnerability and when the adversarial goal is to ensure that the distributed implementation of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm converges to sub-optimal models, we consider that those model-poisoning attacks target the availability. The aim of the defense in this case is to ensure convergence to the true optima.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of defending against Byzantine adversaries, approaches have been proposed to ensure the robust aggregation of distributed SGD against adversarial <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> sending poisoned gradients during the training phase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. A very commonly used aggregation rule is averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Byzantine <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> propose vectors farther away from the correct area of search. They can force the <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> to choose a vector that is too large in amplitude or too far in direction from the other vectors. Thus, the linear combinations give the adversary full control of the aggregated gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Hence, Byzantine-resilient gradient aggregation rule techniques have been proposed to guarantee the production of gradients that will make the SGD process converge despite the presence of a minority of adversarial <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Among the Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule techniques, considering that the geometric median of means of independent and identically random gradients converges to the underlying gradient function, Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed an approach to select among the proposed vectors, the vector closest to a center. They take the vectors that minimize the sum of the squared distances to every other vector. This goes from linear to squared-distance-based aggregation rule. However, two Byzantine <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> can collude, one helping the other to be selected, by moving the center of all the vectors farther from the ”correct area”. The majority-based approach considers every subset of vectors, and identifies the subset with the smallest diameter. Combining the intuitions of the majority-based and the squared-distance-based methods, Blanchard et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed to choose the vector that is the closest to its neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, Mhamdi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> discovered a hidden vulnerability of distributed learning in Byzantium. They put forward that convergence is not enough and that in high number of dimensions, an adversary can build on the loss function’s non-convexity to make SGD converge to ineffective models. Precisely, they prove that existing Byzantine-resilient schemes leave a margin of poisoning. This is due to the fact that each gradient aggregation rule technique performs a linear combination of the selected gradients. Thus, the final aggregated gradient might have one unexpectedly high coordinate. Depending on the learning rate, updating the model with such gradient may push and keep the parameter vector in a sub–space rarely reached with the usual, Byzantine–free distributed setup, thus offering sub–optimal models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the assumptions made in the techniques for Byzantine-tolerant distributed learning are explicitly false for federated learning with adversarial nodes. Particularly, they assume that the nodes’ training data are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed), unmodified, and equally distributed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In reality, participants’ local training datasets in federated learning are relatively small and drawn from different distributions. Since non-i.i.d. data are used in FL, each local model may be quite different from the global model. Thus, there are significant differences between the weights of individual models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Clustering techniques aim to detect model updates that are very different from what they should be. However, the attacker might generate poisoning models that are very similar to the true distribution (called “inliers”), but that can still successfully mislead the model. Anomaly detectors consider the magnitudes of model weights (e.g., Euclidean distances between them) or measure cosine similarity between submitted models and the joint model. However, in federated learning, local training datasets on different devices may not be independently and identically distributed (i.e., non-IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Since FL take advantage of the diversity of participants with non-i.i.d. training data, including unusual or low-quality local data and by design, the <span id="S2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> should accept even local models that have low accuracy and significantly diverge from the current global model. As the local training datasets on different <span id="S2.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> devices are more non-IID, the local models are more diverse, leaving more room for attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of the attacks, back-gradient optimization based attack is the state-of-the-art untargeted data poisoning attack for multiclass classifiers. The Gaussian attack randomly crafts the local models on the compromised <span id="S2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> devices. It was demonstrates that both attacks cannot effectively attack Byzantine-robust aggregation rules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, Fang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a directed deviation attack and applied it to four Byzantine-robust federated learning methods. Their attack was successful and increased the error rates of the models although they were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures. They craft local models for the compromised <span id="S2.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> to deviate a global model parameter the most towards the inverse of the direction along which the global model parameter would change without attacks. They proposed updates to make the <span id="S2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">j<sup id="S2.p7.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">th</sup></span> global model parameter change direction (increases or decreases) upon the previous iteration. They also present two defenses to defend against their directed deviation attack. One generalized defense removes the local models that have large negative impact on the error rate of the global model (inspired by Reject on Negative Impact (RONI) that removes training examples that have large negative impact on the error rate of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>), while the other defense removes the local models that result in large loss (inspired by TRIM that removes the training examples that have large negative impact on the loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>). However, their results show that the defenses are not effective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against their directed deviation attack. Since their attack manipulates the local models in each iteration not for the purpose of training, this behavior can be detected by our approach because we aim at detecting unreliable nodes that are not training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Attackers craft local model updates by looking at the cross-sectional status of local model updates at each iteration. No detection strategy thus far forced the attackers to consider their behavior over time before crafting their attack. Our detection performs a longitudinal status monitoring of the actions of all nodes and thus forces attackers to craft models that have to be undetected from this perspective too. The attacker thus faces two challenges. First, the aggregation rules where the detection monitors each iteration at a time to exclude malicious updates by comparing <span id="S2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> to each other, and second, our detection aims at further monitoring the history of a <span id="S2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker’s</span> local model updates to reject the <span id="S2.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> if it is not training.</p>

<div id="S2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The challenge still remains to defend against untargeted model poisoning attacks and reduce the adversarial leeway that causes drift to sub–optimal models. Existing defense mechanisms omit inspecting the behavior in time of a particular node during its training process in order to detect an anomaly and reject poisonous model updates. Without temporal and dynamic monitoring methods, the <span id="S2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> cannot detect and remove malicious or unreliable <span id="S2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> from the system.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attacker’s Knowledge and Capability.</span> Among all nodes, we assume that the attacker controls the entire training process for one or a few compromised <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> and cannot observe the local data samples of other <span id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span>. The attacker does not control the aggregation algorithm used to combine <span id="S3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span>’ updates into the joint model, nor any aspects of the benign participants’ training. We assume that benign nodes create their local models by correctly applying the training algorithm prescribed by federated learning to their local data. (1) The attacker controls the training dataset of any compromised <span id="S3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span>; (2) it controls the local training process and the hyperparameters; (3) it can modify the weights of the local model update and relay false information on behalf of the <span id="S3.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> when communicating with the <span id="S3.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> node; and, (4) it can change its local training from round to round.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the type of attack, the attacker may or may not need to access the local data samples depending on how the local models sent from the compromised <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> devices are crafted. We consider two cases depending on whether the attacker needs the local training datasets on the compromised <span id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> in order to fabricate the malicious local model update. If the attacker can craft the local models on the compromised <span id="S3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> devices by directly modifying the weights in the local model updates sent back to the <span id="S3.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> such that the global model deviates the most towards the inverse of the direction along which the before-attack global model would change, then in this untargeted attack, the attacker didn’t need to observe the local data samples of the compromised <span id="S3.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span>. Untargeted attacks make the learnt model unusable and eventually lead to denial-of-service attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The attacker was able to target the availability and the aim of the defenses in this case is to ensure convergence.</p>

<p id="S3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">In targeted attacks, as time advances attackers are training, meaning that they are advancing towards the same goal. Whereas, in untargeted attacks, as time advances attackers are not training, they are not advancing towards a goal. Red arrows highlight this behavior. Targeted attacks are more costly for the attacker because the attacker will have to participate in the FL process at every iteration by locally training the model with its poison set. The steps of fabricating a poison set and training locally a model are not required in an untargeted attack. Although untargeted attacks are simpler to perform than targeted attacks, defense techniques against targeted attacks based on resilient gradient aggregation rules and clustering techniques do not remediate the untargeted scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our defense protects against untargeted attacks by reducing the drift towards sub-optimal models that they cause. Attackers in this context represent unreliable <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> that are not training and must be neutralized. During the training process of a <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span>, there exists a complicated probabilistic dependency among the iterates. Such dependency cannot be specified from the distributed computing point of view. Since non-i.i.d. data is used in FL, each local model may be quite different from the global model. Thus, there are significant differences between the weights of individual models. However, a fine-grained assessment of the history of the <span id="S4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> permits the evaluation of its behavior in time and results in innovative detection strategies.</p>

Malicious nodes are not concerned in truly training their local model, but rather fabricating update values, thus they are considered unreliable. attestedFL removes the local models that are unreliable before computing the global model in each iteration of federated learning.</p>

The idea of the mechanisms is to compare the Euclidean distance between model updates sent by different workers so that the chosen vector becomes the result of a distance minimization scheme. However, our reason for using Euclidean distance is to compare the Euclidean distance of consecutive model updates sent by the same worker. By doing so, we are able to examine the behaviour of the worker throughout the training in order to remove abnormal training behavior. By monitoring the history of each worker, we can remove the local models of workers that appear to be not training.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The second defense, attestedFL-2, monitors the angular distance of successive local model updates throughout the training of a node to remove abnormal training behavior. Some defense mechanisms in the literature also use the cosine similarity metric to detect malicious workers. For instance, the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> uses the cosine similarity between, again, model updates sent by different workers to adapt the learning rate per client based on the update similarity among indicative features in any given iteration. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, they highlight a defense that computes the pairwise cosine similarity between the different workers of the FL process hoping that the attacker’s malicious model update will stand out. While previous defenses compute a vertical examination of the workers between each other, we propose a horizontal examination and combine the use of Euclidean distance and cosine similarity between models sent by the same worker in order to monitor the behaviour of the worker in time and detect a malicious behaviour.</p>

<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The last defense, attestedFL-3, removes local model updates of <span id="S4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> when their performance doesn’t improve compared to their own previous performance on the same small validation dataset that the <span id="S4.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> holds. We use different metrics in order to account for different lines of defense to protect against the attacks. attestedFL-1 observes the Euclidean distance of the local model towards the global model. When the attacker is able to manipulate the magnitude of the weights of the local model updates in order to bypass the first line of defense, attestedFL-2 monitors the cosine similarity by providing a second line of defense. When observing the angular distance of successive local model updates throughout the training of a node, we are able to detect the malicious workers that weren’t flagged by attestedFL-1 because the direction of a local model update cannot be manipulated without reducing attack effectiveness.</p>

This adds an additional challenge for the attacker to choose from iteration to iteration weights inline with the training process expected at the local node, thus becoming less focused towards the poisoning objective. We note that if the attacker “always” agrees with the global model, this behavior, although not desirable since the local data is not useful, does not make the global model converge on the FL task. In other words, this behavior will not lead to a successful attack. We do not detect this type of attacker as here we only address the model-poisoning attacks that target the model availability by disrupting the training on the FL task.</p>

In attestedFL-2, we measure the cosine similarity of successive local model updates, and observe how the angular distance is behaving throughout the training of a node. Although, the model updates from different nodes are almost orthogonal to each other with very low variance, this is not the case for model updates provided by the same node as training advances. Iteration after iteration the same node is sending local model updates that are more correlated between each other than with model updates of other nodes. A node that is not exhibiting some type of correlation over time between its local model updates may be considered as unreliable.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning explicitly assumes that participants’ local training datasets are relatively small and drawn from different distributions. Since non-i.i.d. data are used in FL, each local model may be quite different from the global model. Thus, there are significant differences between the weights of individual models. FL takes advantage of the diversity of participants with non-i.i.d. training data, including unusual or low-quality local data, and by design, the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> should accept even local models that have low accuracy and significantly diverge from the current global model.</p>

This will highlight if the node appears to be learning.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the untargeted attack, we implement three different federated learning settings each using a different dataset. The first two settings are for different benchmark systems for text and image classification. The text use case consists in training a fully connected neural network for the hand-written digital classification task on the MNIST dataset. This public dataset contains 60,000 28×28 images of 10 digits for training and 10,000 for testing. The model consists of 784 inputs, 10 outputs with soft-max activation and one hidden layer with 30 ReLu units. The dimension of parameters is 25,450. The image use case is training a ResNet-18 model for the image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset contains 60,000 28×28×3 images of 10 classes of objects for training and 10,000 for testing. The standard model ResNet-18 has 18 end-to-end layers and 11,173,962 learnable parameters in total. In all use cases, each <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> shares a copy of the training set. We simulate the federated learning setting by sequential computation of gradients on randomly sampled mini-batches.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Since untargeted attacks reduce the overall performance of the primary task, they are easier to detect.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that when all defense layers are activated, attestedFL is able to protect against the targeted attack because we notice that the accuracy increased compared to the under attack scenario. Particularly, attestedFL-1 increased the accuracy of only 1%. Attackers were able to evade detection by attestedFL-1 because in the targeted scenario, as time advances, attackers are training, meaning that they are advancing towards the same goal. The flags of attestedFL aim at detecting workers that are not training, thus the attackers were not flagged. On the other hand, attestedFL-2 performed better in this scenario. As training advanced, the attacker was sending local model updates that were less and less correlated between each other. Since the attacker was not able to maintain cosine similarity of successive local model updates throughout the training, the attacker was flagged by attestedFL-2. attestedFL-3 also enabled the detection of the attacker at every iteration because the performance on the quasi-validation set at the chief node decreased over time. However, an attacker that has access to the validation set can train on it locally and evade detection by attestedFL-3.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented attestedFL, a defense against untargeted model poisoning attacks in federated learning that proved to reduce the attack effectiveness by monitoring through state persistence if the <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> in the model are training. While the attacks tried to decrease the accuracy, attestedFL increased it, showing the efficiency and security of our proposed defense. Our defense looks at a pattern in the training of the <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">worker</span> in its subset of previously uploaded consecutive local model updates. attestedFL would force an attacker to choose from iteration to iteration weights inline with the training process expected at the local node, thus becoming less focused towards the poisoning objective.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our defense is mostly effective if staged by the <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chief</span> at every iteration. However, since the intuition is that for poisoning to take effect, recent local model updates of <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> have a higher weight on the global model, the assumption can be relaxed. In future work, we will explore such optimizations of our defense and evaluate it under different architectures and topologies (vertical FL, decentralized FL). We will also investigate subversion strategies. Given bounds on how much a deviation in a local model update can influence the output of the global model, an investigation is required into the relationships between the number of single shot attacks that must be done, the time to launch the attack, the size of the network and the impact required for a stealthy attack to succeed and circumvent attestedFL.</p>
