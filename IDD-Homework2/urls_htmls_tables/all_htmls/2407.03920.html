<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various domains, from cybersecurity to industrial systems. However, traditional centralized approaches often encounter challenges related to data privacy. In this context, Federated Learning emerges as a promising solution. This work introduces two innovative algorithms—Ensemble SVDD and Support Vector Election—that leverage Support Vector Machines for anomaly detection in a federated setting. In comparison with the Neural Networks typically used in within Federated Learning, these new algorithms emerge as potential alternatives, as they can operate effectively with small datasets and incur lower computational costs. The novel algorithms are tested in various distributed system configurations, yielding promising initial results that pave the way for further investigation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) has become increasingly pervasive in contemporary life, manifesting in diverse applications within business and consumer products. A plethora of algorithms exist, tailored to specific tasks. Among these tasks, Anomaly Detection (AD) received particular attention during the past few decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Initially conceived to spot low-quality measurements in experimental outcomes, AD swiftly found broader applications due to the intrinsic value of anomalies, events characterized by unexpected and abrupt occurrences. Anomalies, by their nature, are infrequent and often entail significant costs when they do transpire. Consider for instance continuous systems: being able to detect anomalous behaviors as they develop, for instance, within a piece of industrial equipment, or in the human body, enables engineers, in the first case, and physicians, in the second one, to act proactively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By their nature, anomalies escape formal definitions (excluding, of course, that of not behaving as in normal conditions), therefore it is very difficult to find them by using traditional algorithmic methods. Indeed, AD is typically rooted in statistical techniques: notably, ML proved to be effective in detecting or foreseeing them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, the classical supervised approach in ML is not well suited to tackle the problem: this is because data describing anomalies are typically scarce, resulting in a strong class imbalance. This makes AD different from binary classification, and thus requiring different approaches. The more obvious option is that of unsupervised ML techniques: various algorithms have been proposed, as extensively detailed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, a significant drawback pervades the existing paradigm of AD when the objects to be analyzed live in a distributed world. Conventional algorithms require the centralization of all available data to derive a model able to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. Besides the obvious logistical challenges posed by the transmission and storage of substantial data volumes, this centralization introduces serious privacy concerns. The potential leakage of the collected data, either during transmission or as the effect of cyber attacks to the server, raises severe business issues, particularly concerning sensitive domains like those involving medical records, culminating in costly fines, such as the ones regulated by the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given the practical benefits of ML in our society, the imperative arises to derive equivalent value from data involving AD, yet removing privacy concerns from the equation. Enter Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. FL is defined as a loose federation of devices (clients) participating in a ML process, under the coordination of a central server. FL adopts a protocol ensuring that the dataset of each client remains completely undisclosed, even to the server itself. Indeed, clients share with the central server only model updates computed via training on their local observations. The server simply receives these updates and aggregates them to build a global update which is subsequently distributed to all clients, so that they can enrich their performances without compromising privacy.
Within the FL domain, all challenges in the realm of distributed systems related to handling device federations over the Internet are addressed at a lower layer of abstraction. This abstraction is provided by the platform executing the decentralized learning process, enabling developers to focus on devising algorithms that perform comparably to their centralized counterparts within the federated framework.
One of the first studies in which FL was introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> also proposed the first federated algorithm, called <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</em>, devoted to training Neural Networks and applied to the problem of predicting the next word which will be typed using smart keyboards in mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, Neural Networks are at the forefront of contemporary ML models, being able to capture complex and nonlinear relations among data. They have been extensively applied also to the AD domain (see, for instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> for a recent review).
As highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the privacy concerns inherent in FL do not guarantee the availability of sufficient data to effectively train neural models on every single device. A trending solution in the literature is leveraging transfer learning. This involves training a general-purpose model on the central server and then fine-tuning it locally to provide a tailored model to each client, thereby protecting privacy and ensuring good personalized performance.
However, this solution still necessitates data availability on a central server, which is not always guaranteed in privacy-sensitive environments.
Training Neural Networks is computationally expensive, and while high-end smartphones currently available in the market are equipped with processors expressly designed for neural operations, they are more suited for querying complex networks, or fine-tuning them, rather than for a full training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This gap is further pronounced when considering the broader realm of IoT and edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
These challenges leave room to explore alternative methodologies. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have long been used as a valid computational counterpart w.r.t. Neural Networks, because of their ability to generalize without overfitting data, in the meanwhile possibly compressing the dataset onto a small set of <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">support vectors</em> (SVs) that fully describe a learnt model. SVMs have been successfully applied to anomaly detection, modeling the region containing normal observations in two different ways: respectively, learning a hyperplane separating normal data and outliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, or building a small hypersphere enclosing normal observations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The two approaches are equivalent under specific choices for the related hyper parameters, as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This work aims to integrate FL and the Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD) technique introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, proposing two possible strategies for solving the AD problem in the federated context: Support Vector Election and Ensemble SVDD, sketched here below.</p>

Functioning as a relay, the server distributes the incoming models to all clients. The classification of new observations is done via ensemble voting, using all models. When at least one of them predicts that the observation is an inlier, it is classified as such. When all models detect an outlier, the observation is classified as anomalous. To ensure privacy, before transmitting the model, each client generates a synthetic dataset, and trains SVDD a second time on this dataset, to derive SVs that do not originate from the client’s data.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is a well-studied problem in ML and, more in general, in data mining. The goal of anomaly detection is to identify data points that behave in a significantly different way w.r.t. the distribution modeling the usual behavior of a system. Detecting such points is important to spot malfunctions (such as damages in a mechanical system, or bugs in software), to notice illicit use of resources (e.g., frauds in financial transactions of healthcare), or to get aware of the emergence of novel phenomena.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.3" class="ltx_p">One of the fundamental algorithms addressing AD

Points having a high LOF score are therefore considered local outliers. The effectiveness of this approach has been experimentally established, although its sensitivity to parameter selection and its high computational complexity have also been pointed out <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Analogous drawbacks are suffered by CBLOF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, originally introduced to outperform LOF and based on a more refined clustering procedure.
Statistical approaches, such as that adopted by HBOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, evaluate anomalies by separately analyzing the various data features (typically via histogram analysis), subsequently aggregating the results into an outlier score.

The core idea is to keep data on the devices and leverage their computing power to locally train a model. The involved devices can subsequently transmit their model updates to a central server. This server is in charge of aggregating these updates into a global model that is broadcast to all clients.

The proposed algorithms are Ensemble SVDD (ESVDD), in which each client locally runs SVDD and the resulting models are used from the central server to obtain an ensemble learner, and Support Vector Election (SVE), whose clients select representative points via SVDD, to be sent to the server for a second-round learning phase, still using SVDD. The proposed algorithms are built upon the foundation established by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, though using most of the notation from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which fits better the proposed learning algorithms.</p>

Note that outputting a prediction in the learnt model is related to the computation of (<a href="#S2.E1" title="In 2 Anomaly Detection ‣ Support Vector Based Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), which involves all SVs, that is points from the training set. This means that clients cannot directly send their models to the central server without contradicting the FL principle prohibiting data from leaving the client’s domain. To avoid this, ESVDD relies on a noise addition mechanism: after the local training, each client generates a synthetic dataset by drawing a sample from the input space and isolating the points within the learnt sphere<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>More precisely, sampling is based on a mixture of a normal distribution fitted to the dataset and several normal distributions of small variance, centered around SVs. The latter distributions are introduced to avoid that sampling be focused only on the densest regions of the dataset.</span></span></span>.
This process yields a new set of inliers on which SVDD is rerun, resulting in a new model with synthetic SVs not originating from the initial training set. This model can be therefore transmitted to the central server. The server redistributes the received models to all the clients (including the ones not participating in training) as an ensemble, which will classify a new point as normal if and only if it is predicted as such by at least one among the sent models.
As argued in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, it is better to address the prediction problem by assigning a score to the data points rather than a binary “inlier”/“outlier” label, as some of the outliers might be more critical than others.
This is already done by each model in the ensemble. Thus the overall score is computed as follows:
if a point is predicted as an inlier, ESVDD returns the maximum score among all clients’ score assignments; conversely, it returns the sum of scores from all clients. The latter strategy heavily penalizes points that deviate significantly from many clients.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Both ESVDD and SVE score the test data, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of the point being an inlier. This score is converted into a crisp classification via a threshold, and the evaluation of performances is done using the Area Under the Receiving Operator Curve (AUC). All experiments were conducted on the datasets Breast Cancer, Pen Global, Letter and Satellite introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, employing min-max normalization to all features.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.12" class="ltx_p">The first part of the experiments concerns the ability of the proposed algorithms to be able to suitably adapt the learnt model to the provided dataset. In other words, the research question is: “does FL preserve the ability of SVM methods for AD to avoid underfitting the data they process?”. As the experiments are not aimed at evaluating generalization ability (see Sect. <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Evaluating generalization ability ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Support Vector Based Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a> for this part), there is no separation between training and test set, meaning the whole dataset is used for training and evaluating a model.
To answer the research question, a comparison is made with two baselines:

<span id="S5.I1" class="ltx_inline-enumerate">
<span id="S5.I1.i1" class="ltx_inline-item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_inline-item">(i)</span> <span id="S5.I1.i1.1" class="ltx_text">OC-SVM and

<span id="S5.I1.i2" class="ltx_inline-item"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_inline-item">(ii)</span> <span id="S5.I1.i2.1" class="ltx_text">SVDD
</span></span>
</span>
(both the algorithms are described in the Introduction).
Note that the considered baselines likely represent an upper bound to the performance achievable with federated techniques, as centralizing all data should provide them an unfair advantage w.r.t. FL. Following the methodology adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the hyper parameter space is sampled, running each time the learning process and reporting the results in terms of mean and standard deviation of the AUC.

It is evident that SVE can match the performance of the baseline under optimal conditions (highlighted in bold in the table), although its performances w.r.t. the centralized counterparts significantly decrease under less favorable conditions. Similar considerations apply to ESVDD, with a remarkable difference: unexpectedly, this algorithm even outperforms the baseline under optimal conditions. Recall that the analyzed conditions refer to the following variables: degree of bias in the data distribution, client fraction, and total number of clients.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of this study is to adapt SV-based learning algorithms for AD to the FL context, proposing two novel algorithms named ESVDD and SVE. In both cases, the privacy requirements set by FL are addressed using special anonymisation techniques. A first comparison with state-of-the-art (that is, centralized) methods is conducted focusing on the total number of clients available for training, the fraction of clients actually participating in the learning process, and the degree of bias among client data. While centralized approaches generally exhibit the highest performance across datasets, the FL results are closest to this baseline when mimicking a centralized setting, i.e., all clients are used and data are split in an i.i.d. fashion. A trade-off emerges between split bias and fraction of clients, indicating that higher client fractions are needed for optimal performance in high bias scenarios. In some instances, the decentralized approach of FL even outperforms the centralized algorithms; this could be attributed to hyper parameter choices: ESVDD may be less affected by the adopted kernel width, and the use of <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">C</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐶</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">C</annotation></semantics></math> in SVE differs from the centralized version, potentially justifying these differences in results. While no clear winner emerges between the two proposed algorithms, evidence suggests that the anonymisation technique performs better on SVE. In conclusion, while both proposed approaches are valid federated algorithms for AD, SVE stands out as a preferable choice, also in view of the fact that ESVDD increases its model size proportionally to the number of participating clients, making it impractical for massively distributed settings.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Further experiments are crucial to confirm and extend these preliminary results. The algorithms should be tested on additional datasets, using a more realistic data split design and a sensibly higher number of clients, to better fit the FL context. In addition to that, the experiments done so far only perform a simple hyper parameter optimization: allowing the kernel width to be fine-tuned might enhance the overall performance, especially in high-bias settings; analogously, ESVDD could benefit from allowing each client to freely choose its hyper parameters, meanwhile filtering out or merging the models it receives in order to bar its inherent space complexity. Moreover, SVE might entail several training rounds, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, in which clients collectively collaborate in finding the best hyper parameters. Finally, from a theoretical standpoint SVE lends itself to a formal Differential Privacy proof, a necessary step for comparing it with other privacy-preserving algorithms.</p>
