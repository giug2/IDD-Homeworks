<p id="id9.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients cooperatively train models without disclosing local data.
However, the existing works fail to address all these practical concerns in FL: limited communication resources, dynamic network conditions and heterogeneous client properties, which slow down the convergence of FL.
To tackle the above challenges, we propose a heterogeneity-aware FL framework, called FedCG, with adaptive client selection and gradient compression.
Specifically, the parameter server (PS) selects a representative client subset considering statistical heterogeneity and sends the global model to them.
After local training, these selected clients upload compressed model updates matching their capabilities to the PS for aggregation, which significantly alleviates the communication load and mitigates the straggler effect.
We theoretically analyze the impact of both client selection and gradient compression on convergence performance.
Guided by the derived convergence rate, we develop an iteration-based algorithm to jointly optimize client selection and compression ratio decision using submodular maximization and linear programming.
Extensive experiments on both real-world prototypes and simulations show that FedCG can provide up to 5.3<math id="id9.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id9.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id9.1.m1.1.1" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id9.1.m1.1b"><times id="id9.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id9.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> speedup compared to other methods.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as a novel distributed machine learning paradigm has attracted a lot of attention.
In FL, training data are distributed across a large number of edge devices, such as mobile phones, personal computers, or smart home devices.
Under the orchestration of the parameter server (PS), these devices (<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, clients) cooperatively train a global inference model without sharing raw data, which efficiently leverages local computing resources of edge devices and addresses data privacy concerns.
With the technical advantages and implemental feasibilities, FL has been applied in a variety of applications, such as next word prediction, extended reality, and smart manufacturing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its practical effectiveness, there are several key challenges unique to the FL setting that make it difficult to train high-quality models.
<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(1) Limited communication resources.</span>
Since the clients participating in FL need to communicate with the PS iteratively over bandwidth-limited networks, the communication cost is prohibitive and forms a huge impediment to FL’s viability, especially when training modern models with millions of parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(2) Dynamic network conditions.</span> Owing to link instability and bandwidth competition, the communication conditions of wireless channels may fluctuate over time, resulting in dynamics of available bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For example, a user’s smartphone may be allocated higher bandwidth when transmitting model updates at night than during the day.
<span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(3) Heterogeneous client properties.</span> The heterogeneity of the clients usually includes capability heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity.
The clients may be equipped with different computing chips and located in diverse regions, thus their capabilities vary significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The stragglers will delay the aggregation step and make the training process inefficient.
Besides, due to different user preferences and contexts, local data on each client are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID).
For instance, the images collected by the cameras reflect the demographics of each camera’s location.
Heterogeneous statistical data will bring the biases in training and eventually cause an accuracy degradation of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To improve communication efficiency of FL, a natural solution is to reduce the size of transmitted payload or select only a fraction of clients participating in training.
The existing works have adopted quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> techniques to relax the communication load.
But these compression algorithms often assign fixed or identical compression ratios to all clients, which are agnostic to the capability heterogeneity and thereby result in considerable completion time lags.
Besides, these compression schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> do not take statistical heterogeneity into account, deteriorating training efficiency in the presence of non-IID data.
Another line of studies aims to design client selection (or client sampling) schemes based on heterogeneous client properties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, most of which lack joint consideration of capability and statistical heterogeneity.
Although some works take two types of heterogeneity into account <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the derived client selection probabilities are fixed during the training process, which cannot adapt to network dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, most prior works fail to address all the aforementioned challenges, thereby hindering efficient FL.
This motivates us to study the following question: <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to enhance FL by simultaneously addressing the challenges of communication efficiency, network dynamics and client heterogeneity?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle this problem, we propose a heterogeneity-aware FL framework, called FedCG (Federated Learning with <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>lient selection and <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">G</span>radient compression).
At each round, the PS selects a diverse subset of clients that carry representative gradient information and then sends the global model to the selected clients.
After local training, these clients adopt gradient compression to further boost communication efficiency.
FedCG adaptively assigns appropriate compression ratios to selected clients based on their heterogeneous and time-varying capabilities.
In this way, each client uploads compressed model updates matching its capabilities to the PS.
Finally, the PS aggregates the model updates to obtain the latest global model.
Under this framework, our advantages are reflected in two aspects.
On one hand, we select a representative client subset such that their aggregated model updates approximate full client aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
By encouraging diversity in client selection, FedCG can effectively reduce redundant communication and promote fairness, which modulates the skew introduced by non-IID data.
On the other hand, different compression ratios will adapt to dynamic network conditions and heterogeneous capabilities, which contributes to mitigating the straggler effect and thus accelerates the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">More importantly, instead of directly combining client selection and gradient compression, we highlight that their decisions are interacted and demonstrate the need for joint optimization.
Specifically, the compression ratios should be adapted to the heterogeneous capabilities of the selected clients.
Correspondingly, client selection is also bound up with the degree of gradient compression. Selecting clients with over-compressed gradients will impede convergence.
As a result, the naive combination of existing client selection and gradient compression schemes cannot adequately address the key challenges of FL and may degrade training performance, which is empirically verified in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, jointly optimizing client selection and compression ratio is non-trivial for the following reasons.
<span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Firstly</span>, the quantitative relationship between client selection, gradient compression and model convergence is unclear.
<span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Secondly</span>, it is difficult to determine the proper compression ratios to achieve a delicate trade-off between resource overhead and model accuracy. Things will get even worse while considering the capability heterogeneity across different clients.
<span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Thirdly</span>, the tightly coupled problem of client selection and compression ratio decision adds additional challenges to algorithm design.
In light of the above discussion, we state the key contributions of this paper as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the iterative communication between the PS and clients will incur considerable costs, particularly when the underlying model is of high complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
To this end, various works have been devoted to improving communication efficiency by reducing the size of transmitted models/gradients or selecting a subset of clients.
On one hand, compression techniques have been adopted to alleviate the transmission burden, including quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The quantization based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> aim to represent each element with fewer bits, such as QSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and signSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Optimal compression ratio allocation for quantization is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Other studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> apply sparsification to transmit a small subset of gradients so that the communication overhead can be reduced dramatically.
However, the aforementioned works assign identical compression ratios to heterogeneous clients and thus the stragglers with poor channel conditions will become the bottleneck of model training.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> provide client-specific compression schemes according to communication heterogeneity. However, they do not consider statistical heterogeneity and thus exhibit poor performance in the presence of non-IID data, in terms of model accuracy and convergence rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, client selection plays a critical role in FL and has been extensively studied in previous works.
In the common implementation, clients are selected uniformly at random or proportional to local dataset size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which results in poor training performance and long latency due to non-IID data and capability heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Considering the statistical property, some sampling methods have investigated different criteria to evaluate the importance of clients, such as local loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, test accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, client correlations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and local data variability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
However, the above strategies ignore the heterogeneity of clients’ capabilities and may suffer from the straggler effect.

A very recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> optimizes client selection probabilities while accounting for both data and capability heterogeneity.
In this solution, the exchange of complete models incurs exorbitant communication cost and the obtained probabilities cannot be adaptively adjusted as training progresses, which ignores time-varying network conditions and thus exhibits less flexibility.
Compared with the prior works, FedCG can <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">simultaneously</span> cope with the challenges of communication efficiency, network dynamics and client heterogeneity by joint optimization of client selection and gradient compression.</p>

Considering limited communication bandwidth and client availability, we select a fraction of clients to participate in training, which effectively reduces communication overhead.
However, the clients located in geographically distinct regions generate data from different distributions (<span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, non-IID) in practice.
Many clients may provide similar and redundant gradient information for aggregation, which cannot reflect the true data distribution in the global view.
Selecting such clients will waste resources and cause the global model to be biased towards certain clients, thus exacerbating the negative impact of non-IID data on training performance.
To this end, we introduce diversity to client selection and select representative clients out of the whole while adhering to resource constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

By encouraging diversity in model updates, we reduce redundant communication and increase the impact of under-represented clients that contribute different information, thereby promoting fairness.
In this way, FedCG will counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and speed up convergence.</p>

Gradient compression is another commonly adopted solution to alleviate network pressure due to its practicality and substantial bandwidth efficiency.
Among previous gradient compression techniques, Top-k is a promising compression operator with empirical and theoretical studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Only the gradients with larger absolute values are required to transmit for global aggregation, which can sparsify the local gradients to only 0.1% density without impairing model convergence or accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, we adopt Top-k sparsification in this paper due to its efficiency and simplicity.
It is worth mentioning that other compression operators (<span id="S3.SS2.p3.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, Random-k sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>) can also be compatible with our framework.

Specifically, the clients with excellent capabilities (<span id="S3.SS2.p4.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, short completion time) are expected to adopt slight gradient compression, while the others with poor capabilities (<span id="S3.SS2.p4.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, long completion time) should compress the gradients more aggressively. As a result, the selected clients will achieve approximately identical per-round completion time.
Adaptive gradient sparsification dramatically saves the communication cost and mitigates the impact of stragglers, which provides substantial benefits in improving training efficiency, particularly in the resource-limited and heterogeneous wireless environments envisioned for FL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key insight behind FedCG is that client selection and compression ratio decision interact with each other.
We cannot reach the optimal state by independently determining the client subset and compression ratios.
Therefore, this coupled property raises the necessity for joint optimization.
However, it is usually difficult to optimize both at the same time.
While if we fix one decision and then optimize the other, both of which are greatly simplified.
To this end, we propose an iteration-based algorithm to jointly optimize client selection and compression ratio decision for the tightly coupled problem.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.5" class="ltx_p">As shown in Alg. <a href="#alg2" title="In V-A Joint Optimization Process ‣ V Algorithm Design ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, in each iteration, we first apply submodular maximization in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Client Selection Strategy ‣ V Algorithm Design ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a> to select a diverse subset from candidate clients, thereby minimizing the approximation error (Line 4). The aggregated gradients of selected clients are a good approximation of the full gradients from all clients.
Then we determine appropriate compression ratios for these clients by solving the optimization problem (<a href="#S5.E17" title="In V-C Compression Ratio Decision Strategy ‣ V Algorithm Design ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="V-C Compression Ratio Decision Strategy ‣ V Algorithm Design ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-C</span></span></a> (Line 5).
If the derived solution contributes to the reduction of compression error, we update the current client subset and compression ratios (Lines 6-8).
Then, we find the client with the smallest compression ratio in the subset, and remove it from the candidate clients of the next iteration (Lines 9-10).
This design prevents the client with over-compressed gradients from participating in FL and affecting model accuracy.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.10" class="ltx_p">Based on theoretical analysis, we aim to select a subset of clients to minimize approximation error under resource constraints, thereby improving convergence performance.
The approximation error reflects how well the aggregated gradients of the selected clients approximate the gradients from all clients.
To this end, we introduce diversity to client selection so that the selected clients can be representative of all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

Consequently, the algorithm overhead can be negligible compared to the massive overhead for model training and transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, which is empirically verified in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.
Besides, it is infeasible for the PS to collect the gradients from all clients for marginal gain calculation.
For the clients whose gradients have not been collected at the current round, we estimate the marginal gain with their historical gradient information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
In a nutshell, we relate the gradient approximation to submodular maximization.
According to the marginal gain of the submodular function, we select the diverse subset of clients to minimize the approximation error between the estimated and the full gradients.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The compression ratio has two contrasting effects on the training process.
The larger compression ratio can preserve more information from the original gradients, which reduces the compression error and thus ensures the model accuracy.
However, the communication overhead is still high under these circumstances.
Conversely, the smaller compression ratio will contribute to reducing communication overhead, but it leads to higher compression error and is more likely to deteriorate the model accuracy.
To strike a judicious trade-off between resource overhead and model accuracy, we aim to minimize the compression error under given resource constraints.</p>

Unfortunately, the communication conditions of wireless links are usually time-varying due to network bandwidth reallocation and clients’ mobility, and it is usually impossible to obtain this information in advance.
To overcome the unavailability of future information, we divide the long-term optimization problem into a series of one-shot problems. Given the remaining resources, we online determine the compression ratios for the current round.
Thus, the compression ratios can be continuously adjusted to accommodate system dynamics without requiring future network conditions as prior knowledge.

Consequently, these clients adaptively compress and upload the gradients under resource constraints, preventing the ones with poor capabilities from becoming the bottleneck of FL.</p>

The prototype system helps us capture real-world resource overhead (<span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, time and traffic consumption) and the simulation system is used to evaluate larger-scale FL scenarios with manipulative parameters.
<span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(1) Testbed settings:</span> The hardware prototype system consists of an AMAX deep learning workstation as the PS and 30 commercial embedded devices as the clients. Specifically, the workstation is carrying one 8-core Intel Xeon
CPU and 4 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPUs. The clients include 10 NVIDIA Jetson AGX devices, 10 NVIDIA Jetson NX devices, and 10 NVIDIA Jetson TX2 devices<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/support-resources</span></span></span>, which reflect capability heterogeneity of clients. All devices are interconnected via a commercial WiFi router and we develop a TCP-based socket interface for communication between the PS and clients.
<span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(2) Simulation settings:</span> We simulate an FL system with 100 virtual clients (each is implemented as a process in the system). To reflect heterogeneous and dynamic network conditions, we fluctuate each client’s inbound bandwidth between 10Mb/s and 20Mb/s. Considering that the outbound bandwidth is typically smaller than the inbound bandwidth in a typical WAN, we set it to fluctuate between 1Mb/s and 5Mb/s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and randomly change it every round. For computation heterogeneity, the time of one local iteration follows a Gaussian distribution whose mean and variance are from the measurements of the prototype.</p>

We observe that FedCG achieves a comparable accuracy and converges much faster than the other methods for all four datasets.

Furthermore, the accuracy of FedCG always surpasses the other benchmarks after a given time.
In particular, our framework achieves 74.94% accuracy after training AlexNet over CIFAR-10 for 10,000s while that of FedAvg, OptRate, FlexCom and AdaSample is 72.49%, 74.01%, 74.83% and 74.81%, respectively.
These results demonstrate the advantages of FedCG for both convex and non-convex learning tasks.</p>

To validate the efficiency of FedCG, we record the resource overhead of different methods when they attain the target accuracy in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, including completion time and traffic consumption. Note that the target accuracy is set as the accuracy that all methods can achieve.
As summarized in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, compared with the benchmarks, FedCG reduces the training time by 55.4% and network traffic by 50.3% on average for reaching the same accuracy.
The reasons for such superior performance are as follows.
Compared to FedAvg and AdaSample, the solutions with model compression (<span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, OptRate, FlexCom and FedCG) can save much more network traffic. However, OptRate assigns identical compression ratios to heterogeneous clients, which exacerbates the straggler effect.
Although FlexCom and FedCG achieve similar traffic consumption by assigning different compression ratios to clients, FlexCom still produces a long training completion time without considering the computation heterogeneity.
In addition, we note that optimizing sampling probabilities like AdaSample can improve training efficiency to a certain extent, but cannot essentially address heterogeneity challenges since the clients with large capability gaps may participate in FL at the same round.
By contrast, with the assistance of adaptive client selection and gradient compression, FedCG brings significant savings in both time and traffic consumption, thereby effectively accelerating the training process of FL.</p>

We proceed to investigate how our proposed framework performs under statistical heterogeneity.
Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> depicts the required time for FedCG and benchmarks to reach the target accuracy under different levels of non-IID data.
We set the target accuracy of LR, AlexNet, ResNet9 and ResNet18 as 90%, 67%, 51% and 33%, respectively.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, all methods suffer from performance degradation with the increasing skewness of data distribution.
Nevertheless, FedCG only has the slightest increase in completion time compared to the other benchmarks and exhibits robustness to non-IID data.
The advantage of FedCG is attributed to diverse client selection which increases the impact of under-represented clients, thereby promoting fairness and reducing the bias introduced by non-IID data.
In addition, the savings of resource overhead in FedCG further enlarge the performance gap as the non-IID level increases.

To evaluate the performance of FedCG in large-scale FL scenarios, we conduct our experiments by simulations with 100 clients.
Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> plots the accuracy curve of different methods in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.
We find that our proposed framework still substantially outperforms the other benchmarks in large-scale FL scenarios and exhibits faster convergence without sacrificing accuracy.
For instance, FedCG takes 5,170s to achieve 70% accuracy for AlexNet over CIFAR-10, while the completion time of FedAvg, OptRate, FlexCom and AdaSample are 22,009s, 14,225s, 11,129s and 10,392s, respectively.

Such performance gain of FedCG is rooted in appropriate client selection strategy and different compression ratios. This not only excludes the clients with poor capabilities from training but also allows each selected client to transmit compressed gradients fitting its capabilities.
Moreover, the decisions including client subset and compression ratio are continuously adjusted during training to adapt to the time-varying capabilities of clients.
The above simulation results strongly verify the usability of our design in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments.</p>

We further conduct the simulation experiments to analyze the influence of the number of selected clients (<span id="S6.SS3.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, <math id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math>) on the training efficiency.
Firstly, we compare the traffic consumption of different methods for achieving the target accuracy (<span id="S6.SS3.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, 90%) when the number of selected clients increases from 10 to 30.
The results for LR over MNIST are shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a>.
Apparently, network traffic of all methods increases gradually with <math id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> ranging from 10 to 30.
This is expected because more clients participate in training at each round, which will consume more communication resources to transmit model updates.
Nevertheless, FedCG outperforms other methods under different numbers of selected clients and reduces network traffic consumption by about 11.2-82.4% compared with the four benchmarks.
Secondly, we measure the decision overhead of the proposed joint optimization algorithm with various numbers of selected clients, which is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Testbed Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>.
Although the algorithm overhead becomes larger as <math id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p2.3.m3.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> increases, the maximum overhead is only 1.2s, which is much smaller than the FL training and transmission time (<span id="S6.SS3.p2.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, hundreds of seconds) and thus can be ignored.
These results suggest that the iterative optimization process of the proposed algorithm incurs a small decision overhead and will not hinder the practical deployment of FedCG in FL.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p3.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Necessity of Joint Optimization.</span>
Instead of simple combination, FedCG aims to achieve efficient FL by joint optimization of client selection and gradient compression.
To indicate the importance of the proposed joint optimization algorithm, we compare the training performance of independent decision, naive combination and FedCG.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-C Simulation Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Adaptive Control of Client Selection and Gradient Compression for Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, it is clear that FedCG consistently converges faster than the other three methods without loss of accuracy.

The explanation for this phenomenon is that client selection and compression ratio decision are tightly coupled. Consequently, neither independent decision nor naive combination can handle network dynamics and client heterogeneity well, thus negatively affecting the convergence performance.
FedCG overcomes this issue by proposing an iteration-based algorithm and demonstrates impressive performance improvement, which emphasizes the necessity of joint optimization process.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called FedCG, to achieve efficient FL with adaptive client selection and gradient compression.
Specifically, FedCG selects a diverse set of clients and assigns different compression ratios to selected clients considering their heterogeneous and time-varying capabilities.
We jointly optimize client selection and compression ratio decision, which address the challenges of FL on communication efficiency, network dynamics and client heterogeneity.
Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>
