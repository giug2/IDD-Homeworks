<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning (FL), a global statistical model is developed by encouraging mobile users to perform the model training on their local data and aggregating the output local model parameters in an iterative manner. However, due to limited energy and computation capability at the mobile devices, the performance of the model training is always at stake to meet the objective of local energy minimization. In this regard, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC)-enabled FL addresses the tradeoff between the model performance and the energy consumption of the mobile devices by allowing users to offload a portion of their local dataset to an edge server for the model training. Since the edge server has high computation capability, the time consumption of the model training at the edge server is insignificant. However, the time consumption for dataset offloading from mobile users to the edge server has a significant impact on the total time consumed to complete a single round of FL process. Thus, resource management in MEC-enabled FL is challenging, where the objective is to reduce the total time consumption while saving the energy consumption of the mobile devices. In this paper, we formulate an energy-aware resource management for MEC-enabled FL in which the model training loss and the total time consumption are jointly minimized, while considering the energy limitation of mobile devices. In addition, we recast the formulated problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) to capture the coupling constraints between the radio resource management and dataset offloading. To that end, we analyze the impact of the dataset offloading and computing resource allocation on the model training loss, time, and the energy consumption. Finally, we present the convergence analysis of the proposed solution, and evaluate its performance against the traditional FL approach. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) builds a statistical model by allowing mobile users to train local models on datasets residing at their mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The users only share the trained local model parameters to a central server for model aggregation; thus, the local datasets’ privacy is preserved. In recent years, several works study FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. These works are motivated by the possibility of leveraging existing cellular infrastructure for offering learning services to the users via distributed model training approach, such as FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, most of the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> highlight the implication of wireless resource optimization, convergence analysis, and training-time minimization when performing distributed model training over dynamic wireless conditions. Moreover, there are several other overlooked challenges and open problems for the direct implementation of FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. On the one hand, the model training’s performance is significantly influenced by local datasets and computing resources used for the training. On the other hand, the subset of mobile devices selected in each round of model training affects the time required to reach a global model’s desired accuracy level. This situation gets exacerbated when we have dynamic wireless conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The trade-off between the model performance, energy and time consumption can be resolved by enabling Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In particular, MEC brings the high computing servers closer to the mobile users so that users with low computing and energy capability are able to offload their latency and computing-intensive tasks to the edge server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Therefore, mobile users are able to offload a selected portion of local dataset to the edge server where a statistical model is trained by the edge server simultaneously with several mobile devices in hands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Even though FL is intended for the privacy preserving application, a portion of local dataset which are not privacy-sensitive can be offloaded to the MEC for further computation. Then, the MEC server can perform the model training on all the datasets offloaded by the mobile users, simultaneously, and perform averaging of local model parameters and the obtained model to build a single global model. Besides, the users can determine the offloaded data samples based on the freshness of the collected data. Thus, this approach is more practical as it should be up to the users to decide the kind of data they want to share and further improve the model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the performance of the global model in FL is highly affected by the heterogeneity in computing resources of the mobile device for training the local model. Besides, due to the energy limitation of the mobile devices, the user may use less amount of local dataset and computing resource for the model training, which would result in lower model performance. Thus, the trade-off between the energy consumption of mobile devices and performance of the training model is required to be addressed in FL. In this regard, the edge server is a powerful computing device; hence, the time and energy consumption of the model training at the edge server is negligible. Therefore, it is intuitive to leverage the MEC infrastructure for sharing computation burden of resource constrained mobile devices during the model training process in FL. By allowing the mobile users to offload a portion of their local datasets to the edge server, the performance of the global model can be preserved while saving the energy consumption of the mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Inline with this idea, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed the local data sharing mechanism for FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors mitigated the non-i.i.d. data problem by allowing a limited number of users to upload their local data to a server; and thus, the server trains a model on the uploaded data to support the FL process during model aggregation. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a distributed data augmentation algorithm in which users share a fraction of their local dataset to confront the lack of on-device data samples. Similar to these approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, we give users the ultimate power to decide the dataset offloading. On the other hand, as a ML developer, the global model gets benefited with our proposed scheme, wherein we balance between the high accuracy obtained in a centralized setting and the distributed privacy preserving model training framework, such as FL. The proposed mechanism is practical and can be applied to real-time applications such as autonomous driving and mobile surveillance, where the privacy of the data collected from the devices is not a major concern.</p>

Moreover, the synchronous update model for FL is considered in this paper. The mobile devices participating in FL train their local model with datasets residing at the mobile devices and transmit the weights of the model to the edge server in the traditional FL approach. In our proposed MEC-enabled FL model, the mobile devices simultaneously offload a portion of their datasets to the edge server and train their local model with the remaining portion. After all the offloaded datasets are received by the edge server, the edge training is performed. The model aggregation is carried out after the edge training and the weight transmission of all mobile devices.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The energy-aware resource management algorithm is proposed for the joint learning, dataset offloading, computing, and uplink resource management for the MEC-enabled FL which works as follows. First, the initial value for the Lagrange multipliers, dataset offloading, computing and uplink resource allocation are chosen. Users offload a portion of their local dataset to the edge server as stated at line <a href="#alg1.l4" title="In Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-E Energy-aware Resource Management Algorithm ‣ IV Energy-aware Resource Management For MEC-enabled FL ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Users and the edge server perform the model training simultaneously as defined at line <a href="#alg1.l5" title="In Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-E Energy-aware Resource Management Algorithm ‣ IV Energy-aware Resource Management For MEC-enabled FL ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Once the weight update of the all users is received at the edge server, the model aggregation is performed as stated at line <a href="#alg1.l7" title="In Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-E Energy-aware Resource Management Algorithm ‣ IV Energy-aware Resource Management For MEC-enabled FL ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The Lagrange multipliers, the dataset offloading, computing and uplink resource allocation are then updated. In addition, the edge server and the users perform the model training and the updated weights are aggregated. This process is repeated until convergence as defined in lines <a href="#alg1.l9" title="In Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-E Energy-aware Resource Management Algorithm ‣ IV Energy-aware Resource Management For MEC-enabled FL ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>-<a href="#alg1.l21" title="In Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-E Energy-aware Resource Management Algorithm ‣ IV Energy-aware Resource Management For MEC-enabled FL ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a>. Since all mobile users and the edge server implement the best response strategy, the proposed algorithm will converge to a stationary point.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a single-cell macro base station deployed together with an edge server for the model training and aggregation. MINIST dataset is used for the model training where the logistic regression is performed on 50 mobile users. The data samples in the whole dataset are randomly shuffled and distributed among users where each user has approximately 1,200 data samples. The total available uplink bandwidth is considered as 20 MHz. The edge server is equipped with 16 GHz CPU. We consider the system heterogeneity in the simulation where the mobile users have different CPU frequency and energy limitation where the CPU frequency of the mobile users follows a uniform distribution of [1.2, 1.5] GHz. The energy limit of the mobile users is considered to follow a uniform distribution as well which is [45, 60] watt. We compare the traditional FL and proposed MEC-enabled FL where the dataset offloading for the edge training is not allowed in the traditional FL which uses all the data samples in the local dataset for the training. The loss value in the figures is the testing loss on the final model. For the proposed energy-aware resource management algorithm, the initial points for the dataset offloading and computing resource allocation are chosen randomly while the uniform allocation is performed on the uplink bandwidth resources. To compare the traditional and proposed MEC-enabled FL in terms of the size of offloaded dataset and computing resource, the uniform allocation is used for the uplink bandwidth resource management.</p>

Since the dataset offloading is not allowed in the traditional FL, the loss and total time consumption are constant across the size of the offloaded dataset. The proposed MEC-enabled FL can achieve the better model performance by offloading the portion of local dataset where the edge server performs the model training on all the local dataset offloaded from the user. The proposed MEC-enabled FL is same as the traditional FL when the fraction of the offloaded data is zero which means the mobile users use all the dataset for the local training. When the fraction is 1, the proposed FL is same as the centralized model training where all the local datasets are used for the model training at edge server. Since the users need to upload the local datasets to the edge server, the total time consumption of the proposed model is higher than the traditional FL but it can be minimized by the decent resource management approach.</p>

As more computing resources are used for the local model training, the loss and time consumption is decreased. However, the energy consumption of the mobile device will increase with the computing resource allocation. As for the amount of offloaded dataset, the loss and energy decreases as the size of offloaded dataset increases since the energy consumption of the model training is much higher than that of transmissions. But, the total time consumption is increased with respect to the offloaded dataset due to the time taken for dataset offloading. The total time taken for the cell-center user is much lower than that of the cell-edge user. Since the synchronous update is used for the model aggregation, the cell-edge user has the high impact on the total time consumption.</p>

Due to the poor channel condition of the cell-edge user, less local dataset is offloaded to the edge server while more uplink resource is required for the dataset offloading than the cell-center user in order to minimize the total time consumption. Similar to the uplink resource allocation for the dataset offloading, the cell-edge user require more uplink bandwidth for the weight transmission than the cell-center user to reduce the total time consumption. Since the cell-edge user offload a small portion of its local datasets to the edge server, the higher amount of computing resource is required for the local training than that of the cell-center user which is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Energy-aware Resource Management for Federated Learning in Multi-access Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the energy-aware resource management for the MEC-enabled FL is proposed. In particular, the mobile users are allowed to offload a portion of their local dataset to the MEC server; and hence, the tradeoff between the performance of the training model and the energy consumption at user devices with respect to the amount of data samples used for the local training is handled. To that end, an energy-aware resource management problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the training loss and time consumption, while satisfying the device’s energy constraints. The formulated problem is decoupled into multiple sub-problems due to the coupling between the decision variables. Then, the solution for the computing resource management is derived by ensuring the energy budget of the mobile users. Moreover, the problem of dataset offloading and uplink resource management is formulated as a GNEP, and the existence of a GNE is derived. The solution to the dataset offloading and uplink bandwidth allocation is derived to minimize the total time consumption. To that end, the energy-aware resource management algorithm is proposed. Finally, extensive simulations are performed which show that the total time consumption of the proposed MEC-enabled FL model is competitively lower than the traditional FL approach when adopting the proposed resource management algorithm.</p>
