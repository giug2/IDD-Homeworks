<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates federated learning in a wireless communication system, where random device selection is employed with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The analysis indicates that while training deep learning networks using federated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) on non-IID datasets, device selection can generate gradient errors that accumulate, leading to potential weight divergence. To mitigate training divergence, we design an age-weighted FedSGD to scale local gradients according to the previous state of devices. To further improve learning performance by increasing device participation under the maximum time consumption constraint, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by including resource allocation and sub-channel assignment. By transforming the resource allocation problem into convex and utilizing KKT conditions, we derived the optimal resource allocation solution. Moreover, this paper develops a matching based algorithm to generate the enhanced sub-channel assignment. Simulation results indicate that i) age-weighted FedSGD is able to outperform conventional FedSGD in terms of convergence rate and achievable accuracy, and ii) the proposed resource allocation and sub-channel assignment strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption and improve learning performance by increasing the number of selected devices.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the spread of computer chips, powerful computational capabilities become available at edge nodes, and therefore, the collected data can be directly utilized for learning tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In this context, federated learning, as a promising technology for distributed learning, has attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry. In federated learning, a neural network is constructed by a central server and shared among all participating devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. At each device, the received neural network is trained with local data and transmitted to the server for aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Compared with centralized learning that requires offloading raw data to the server, in federated learning, learning tasks are executed collaboratively without data sharing, and hence, privacy security can be improved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, since the size of the transmitted neural network is generally smaller than the size of original data, communication efficiency can be achieved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, since federated learning relies on periodic transmission, its performance is affected by wireless networks, and hence, the optimization of communications is recognized as an important research direction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the fact that federated learning usually involves a large number of devices for multiple rounds of training and transmission, device selection/sampling becomes a common method to implement this algorithm under limited bandwidth resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Some existing works focused on addressing system heterogeneity by selecting devices based on hardware specifications and communication environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, device selection and beamforming design were jointly considered in an over-the-air computation (AirComp) based federated learning framework, where an optimization problem was formulated to maximize the number of selected devices. By revealing the interaction between global loss and packet error rates, device selection was included to cope with the limited number of resource blocks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Particularly, in this work, a device can be selected only if the latency and energy consumption constraints can be satisfied. Since the transmitted models can be severely damaged by noise in AirComp based federated learning, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, devices with weak channel conditions were ignored for aggregation as the transmit power is not sufficient to compensate for the effects of wireless communications. Recognizing the degradation of learning performance caused by low device availability, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a device selection strategy based on achievable long-term participation rates to mitigate the impact of device selection variance on global model convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In realistic scenarios of federated learning, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data is unevenly distributed among devices, which brings challenges to device selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in system based device selection, the server tends to select devices with better channel conditions and/or powerful computational capacities, which may lead to a decline in learning performance on non-IID datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. To this end, by selecting devices that provide more contributions in the aggregation, some works jointly considered system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, channel conditions and local model updates were studied, and four device selection polices were proposed based on different priorities. Simulation results demonstrated that jointly including both metrics can provide better learning performance than using either metric separately. In order to achieve the target global loss within less time consumption, the selection probabilities of devices in the classic random device selection scheme were optimized based on latency and gradient norms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Considering that the device contribution is not only related to dataset size, a biased device selection scheme was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, in which the server transmits the global model to a set of candidate devices for evaluation, and then selects devices with larger local losses. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, age-of-information (AoI) was considered as a metric to improve the fairness of device selection. It was indicated that by minimizing the overall AoI of all devices, both learning performance and time consumption can be improved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Since learning based device selection is performed on a set of available devices, its performance can be further improved by increasing device availability, which is determined by channel conditions, computational capacities, battery levels, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the optimal resource allocation based on these factors. Energy consumption, as an important criterion that can directly limit device participation, has been extensively researched in existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a comprehensive energy consumption minimization problem was investigated in federated learning systems, where monotonicity analysis was utilized to obtain solutions. Wireless federated learning was also studied in eavesdropping scenarios, in which idle devices transmit jamming signals to improve the secrecy rate of the transmitting device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, energy harvesting and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) were exploited to provide computing energy and facilitate uplink transmission, respectively. In these works, the bisection method was utilized for algorithm design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> focused on studying long-term energy consumption minimization, where deep reinforcement learning was employed. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, NOMA schemes were adopted in a clustered federated learning system, where sub-channel assignment and power allocation were studied to further enhance device availability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As aforementioned, with non-IID data, system based device selection leads to a decline in learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, while learning based device selection requires additional transmission and analysis for local models or gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. A novel method, namely age-weighted FedSGD, is proposed to mitigate the learning performance degradation caused by implementing device selection on non-IID datasets. This scheme can be employed in a variety of existing device selection strategies without extra information transmission and model/data analysis, and hence, it will not increase system overhead or cause privacy leakage. Compared to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> which exploits AoI to guide device selection, in this work, the number of idle communication rounds serves as a weighting factor to directly regulate the update of global models. Moreover, to further increase device availability, an energy consumption minimization problem is jointly addressed through a low-complexity solution, thus avoiding the loss of optimality in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since device selection is implemented in a federated learning algorithm using non-IID datasets, the data distribution of the selected devices may be different from the global data distribution, and therefore, the weight divergence issue may occur <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. That is, the divergence between the weights obtained from the considered federated learning framework and the desired weights obtained from centralized learning increases with training. To evaluate weight divergence, complete device selection is included as the baseline, where all devices are selected in each communication round.

It can be observed that on non-IID datasets, weight divergence in conventional FedSGD increases with training, while age-weighted FedSGD can efficiently reduce weight divergence and control it to a certain level. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that age-weighted FedSGD is still valid with IID data, although the weight divergence issue is not severe in this case.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, the formulated sub-channel assignment problem in (<a href="#Sx3.EGx5" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Exploring Age-of-Information Weighting in Federated Learning under Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">31</span></a>) is solved with the given resource allocation solutions. Specifically, the optimal resource allocation for all devices assigned to all sub-channels can be obtained in Section IV, and therefore, this solution is treated as a preference list to construct a matching based sub-channel assignment algorithm. Note that some combinations of devices and sub-channels may not be feasible due to inability to satisfy the maximum time consumption constraint, and the proposed algorithm may tend to assign devices to the corresponding infeasible sub-channels to achieve lower energy consumption. In order to avoid this case, a large value is assigned as the energy consumption of these infeasible combinations, and any combination with this energy consumption will be removed from the final matching.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.10" class="ltx_p">Due to the fact that the device and sub-channel in a combination have the same utility, the intent of sub-channels can be omitted. Moreover, since each device is assigned to one sub-channel and each sub-channel is occupied by one device, if a device tends to establish a new matching, it needs to exchange with another device instead of joining the combination directly. That is, the considered matching is a swap matching, defined as follows:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the definition of the swap-blocking pair, a matching based sub-channel assignment algorithm is presented in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V-A Design of Matching based Algorithm ‣ V Matching based Sub-Channel Assignment ‣ Exploring Age-of-Information Weighting in Federated Learning under Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In this algorithm, an initial matching is firstly obtained by randomly assigning all devices into all sub-channels. Afterwards, each device in turn operates on the remaining devices in order to find the swap-blocking pair. If any two devices can form a swap-blocking pair, their sub-channels are exchanged and the new matching is recorded. This algorithm is repeated until no new swap-blocking pair can be found in a complete cycle. Based on the finial matching provided by Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V-A Design of Matching based Algorithm ‣ V Matching based Sub-Channel Assignment ‣ Exploring Age-of-Information Weighting in Federated Learning under Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the solution of sub-channel assignment problem (<a href="#Sx3.EGx5" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Exploring Age-of-Information Weighting in Federated Learning under Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">31</span></a>) can be obtained by removing all infeasible combinations.</p>

Based on the definition of a swap-blocking pair, it indicates that the utility of at least one device is strictly reduced while the utility of the other device is not increased. Moreover, for the devices that are not involved, their utility remains the same. As a result, the sum utility, or sum energy consumption, is strictly decreased with this transformation. With the given devices and sub-channels, there is a lower bound on the energy consumption, and therefore, the proposed algorithm can always converge to a final matching.</p>

It demonstrates that with the same device selection results, the proposed age-weighted FedSGD is able to outperform conventional FedSGD with any sub-channel assignment and resource allocation schemes. Compared to RSA and FRA, MSA and KRA can also improve the performance of federated learning. Moreover, since the number of selected devices in each communication round is obviously reduced with FRA, there exist a large gap between FRA and KRA in achievable test accuracy.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates a wireless federated learning framework on non-IID datasets, where random device selection is exploited due to the limited number of sub-channels. By exploring the issue of conventional FedSGD in weight divergence, age-weighted FedSGD is designed to adjust the proportion of local gradients according to the previous state of devices. To further improve the learning performance, an energy consumption minimization problem is formulated, where the resource allocation solution and the sub-channel assignment algorithm are developed based on KKT conditions and matching theory, respectively. The superiority of designed age-weighted FedSGD and the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation and sub-channel assignment strategies are demonstrated in the simulation results.</p>
