<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the development of 3D and 2D data acquisition techniques, it has become easy to obtain point clouds and images of scenes simultaneously, which further facilitates dual-modal semantic segmentation.
Most existing methods for simultaneously segmenting point clouds and images rely heavily on the quantity and quality of the labeled training data.
However, massive point-wise and pixel-wise labeling procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive.
To address this issue, we propose a parallel dual-stream network to handle the semi-supervised dual-modal semantic segmentation task, called PD-Net, by jointly utilizing a small number of labeled point clouds, a large number of unlabeled point clouds, and unlabeled images.
The proposed PD-Net consists of two parallel streams (called original stream and pseudo-label prediction stream).
The pseudo-label prediction stream predicts the pseudo labels of unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images.
Then, the unlabeled data is sent to the original stream for self-training.
Each stream contains two encoder-decoder branches for 3D and 2D data respectively.
In each stream, multiple dual-modal fusion modules are explored for fusing the dual-modal features.
In addition, a pseudo-label optimization module is explored to optimize the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream.
Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PD-Net not only outperforms the comparative semi-supervised methods but also achieves competitive performances with some fully-supervised methods in most cases.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of both 3D and 2D data acquisition techniques, the 3D point clouds and images of scenes could be easily acquired together by jointly utilizing 3D and 2D sensors.
And the correspondences between 3D points and image pixels could be easily calculated with the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the sensors.
Accordingly, unlike the existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> that only segment uni-modal data, many segmentation

However, these fully-supervised dual-modal segmentation methods generally require a time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling procedure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to alleviate the above data annotation problem, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> focus on semi-supervised semantic segmentation for either 3D point clouds or 2D images, where a small proportion of the training data is labeled.
And the general diagram of these methods is shown in the bottom-left part of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Semi-supervised Dual-modal Semantic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
However, these semi-supervised methods only use uni-modal data, which could not make the most of the collected dual-modal data.
Thus, how to utilize the complementary information in point clouds and images to solve the semi-supervised dual-modal segmentation problem remains to be investigated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a parallel dual-stream network to simultaneously handle the semi-supervised semantic segmentation tasks for both point clouds and images, called PD-Net.
It contains two parallel streams with the same architecture: an original stream, and a pseudo-label prediction stream whose parameters are updated by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Each stream in PD-Net contains a 3D encoder-decoder branch, a 2D encoder-decoder branch, and multiple dual-modal fusion modules.
The 3D and 2D branches are utilized to extract 3D and 2D features respectively.
Intuitively, jointly leveraging dual-modal features could improve the segmentation performance, considering the complementarity of 3D features and 2D features (i.e., the 3D features contain rich geometric information but lack textural information, while the 2D features are enriched with color and textural information but are short of depth information).
However, direct fusion may dilute the inter-modal attentive weights, which could undermine the performance instead.
To fully exploit the complementary information in dual-modal data, we propose the dual-modal fusion module, which fuses the 3D and 2D latent features via a multi-head attention-based mechanism.
Besides, a consistency loss term is designed to constrain the semantic consistency between the 3D and 2D features.
The general diagram of the proposed PD-Net is illustrated in the right part of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Semi-supervised Dual-modal Semantic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
it utilizes a small number of labeled point clouds, a large number of unlabeled point clouds, and unlabeled images for training.
The labeled point clouds and their corresponding images are only trained in the original stream, and the labels of the images are projected from the point clouds according to the sensor parameters.
The unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images are trained in both two streams.
Specifically, the output of the original stream is supervised by the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream.
To improve the quality of the pseudo labels generated by the pseudo-label prediction stream so that the effectiveness of the self-training strategy for the unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images is guaranteed, we propose the pseudo-label optimization module to leverages pseudo labels of one modality to improve the quality of pseudo labels of another modality based on a voting mechanism.
The pseudo-label optimization module is non-parametric, thus it is free from inductive bias and performance degeneration due to the domain gap between different modalities.

As seen from this figure, PD-Net employs a parallel two-stream structure: an original stream and a pseudo-label prediction stream.
The original stream is utilized to simultaneously segment the point clouds and images.
The pseudo-label prediction stream is utilized to predict pseudo labels for the unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images for self-training in the original stream.

We evaluate these semi-supervised learning methods based on MinkowskiNet18A and ResNet34 while retaining their other experimental settings for a fair comparison.
All these comparative methods utilize the same labeled set and unlabeled set.

As seen from this table, in two different labeled-ratio settings, the proposed PD-Net outperforms all the comparative methods in point cloud segmentation and image segmentation tasks.

As seen from this table, Model A performs better than the Baseline, indicating that the coarse pseudo labels generated by the pseudo-label prediction stream could supervise the unlabeled data to some extent.
Model B makes further progress based on Model A, demonstrating that using the historical information to update the parameters of the pseudo-label prediction stream is superior to the common updating strategy.
The performances of Model C are promoted based on Model B, which is attributed to the consistency constraints between the 3D and 2D output features and the optimization of the pseudo labels.
The whole PD-Net achieves the best results in most cases, probably because the DMF module could effectively fuse the dual-modal latent features.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To further verify the superiority of the DMF module, we replace the DMF module with a similar module for dual-modal feature fusion, while keeping the experimental settings and other modules unchanged.

As seen from this table, the model with DMF module achieves better segmentation performances, indicating that the multi-head attention-based mechanism has stronger fusion ability than the view fusion strategy in the BP module which simply learns the impact factors for each view at every point.</p>

However, as revealed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, the majority of attention heads can be removed without deviating too much from the original performance and most heads are redundant given the rest of the model at test time.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a parallel dual-stream network, called PD-Net, to handle the semi-supervised dual-modal semantic segmentation task.
The proposed PD-Net consists of two parallel streams (i.e., original stream and pseudo-label prediction stream), in which the 3D and 2D encoder-decoder branches are used to extract 3D and 2D features respectively, and multiple dual-modal fusion modules are used to fuse the multi-scale dual-modal latent features.
The pseudo-label optimization module is explored to improve the quality of the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PD-Net not only outperforms the comparative semi-supervised methods but also achieves competitive performances with some fully-supervised methods in most cases.
