<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes to improve visual question answering (VQA) with structured representations of both scene contents and questions. A key challenge in VQA is to require joint reasoning over the visual and text domains. The predominant CNN/LSTM-based approach to VQA is limited by monolithic vector representations that largely ignore structure in the scene and in the question. CNN feature vectors cannot effectively capture situations as simple as multiple object instances, and LSTMs process questions as series of words, which do not reflect the true complexity of language structure. We instead propose to build graphs over the scene objects and over the question words, and we describe a deep neural network that exploits the structure in these representations. We show that this approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy from 71.2% to 74.4% on the “abstract scenes” multiple-choice benchmark, and from 34.7% to 39.1% for the more challenging “balanced” scenes, <em id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> image pairs with fine-grained differences and opposite yes/no answers to a same question.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of Visual Question Answering has received growing interest in the recent years (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> for example). One of the more interesting aspects of the problem is that it combines computer vision, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. In its <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">open-ended</span> form, a question is provided as text in natural language together with an image, and a correct answer must be predicted, typically in the form of a single word or a short phrase. In the <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple-choice</span> variant, an answer is selected from a provided set of candidates, alleviating evaluation issues related to synonyms and paraphrasing.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>We encode the input scene as a graph representing the objects and their spatial arrangement, and the input question as a graph representing words and their syntactic dependencies. A neural network is trained to reason over these representations, and to produce a suitable answer as a prediction over an output vocabulary.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multiple datasets for VQA have been introduced with either real <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> or synthetic images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Our experiments uses the latter, being based on clip art or “cartoon” images created by humans to depict realistic scenes (they are usually referred to as “abstract scenes”, despite this being a misnomer). Our experiments focus on this dataset of clip art scenes as they allow to focus on semantic reasoning and vision-language interactions, in isolation from the performance of visual recognition (see examples in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Evaluation on the “abstract scenes” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).
They also allow the manipulation of the image data so as to better illuminate algorithm performance. A particularly attractive VQA dataset was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> by selecting only the questions with binary answers (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> yes/no) and pairing each (synthetic) image with a minimally-different complementary version that elicits the opposite (no/yes) answer (see examples in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Evaluation on the “abstract scenes” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, bottom rows). This strongly contrasts with other VQA datasets of real images, where a correct answer is often obvious without looking at the image, by relying on systematic regularities of frequent questions and answers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Performance improvements reported on such datasets are difficult to interpret as actual progress in scene understanding and reasoning as they might similarly be taken to represent a better modeling of the language prior of the dataset.
This hampers, or at best obscures, progress toward the greater goal of general VQA. In our view, and despite obvious limitations of synthetic images, improvements on the aforementioned “balanced” dataset constitute an illuminating measure of progress in scene-understanding, because a language model alone cannot perform better than chance on this data.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Challenges</h4>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The questions in the clip-art dataset vary greatly in their complexity. Some can be directly answered from observations of visual elements, <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is there a dog in the room ?</span>, or <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is the weather good ?</span>. Others require relating multiple facts or understanding complex actions, <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text"></span> <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is the boy going to catch the ball?</span>, or <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is it winter?</span>. An additional challenge, which affects all VQA datasets, is the sparsity of the training data. Even a large number of training questions (almost 25,000 for the clip art scenes of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>) cannot possibly cover the combinatorial diversity of possible objects and concepts. Adding to this challenge, most methods for VQA process the question through a recurrent neural network (such as an LSTM) trained from scratch solely on the training questions.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Language representation</h4>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The above reasons motivate us to take advantage of the extensive existing work in the natural language community to aid processing the questions. First, we identify the syntactic structure of the question using a dependency parser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This produces a graph representation of the question in which each node represents a word and each edge a particular type of dependency (<em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">determiner</span>, <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nominal subject</span>, <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">direct object</span>, <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc</em>.<span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text"></span>). Second, we associate each word (node) with a vector embedding pretrained on large corpora of text data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. This embedding maps the words to a space in which distances are semantically meaningful. Consequently, this essentially regularizes the remainder of the network to share learned concepts among related words and synonyms. This particularly helps in dealing with rare words, and also allows questions to include words absent from the training questions/answers. Note that this pretraining and <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ad hoc</span> processing of the language part mimics a practice common for the image part, in which visual features are usually obtained from a fixed CNN, itself pretrained on a larger dataset and with a different (supervised classification) objective.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Applying Neural Networks to graphs</h4>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The two graph representations feed into a deep neural network that we will describe in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Processing graphs with neural networks ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The advantage of this approach with text- and scene-graphs, rather than more typical representations, is that the graphs can capture relationships between words and between objects which are of semantic significance. This enables the GNN to exploit (1) the <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unordered</span> nature of scene elements (the objects in particular) and (2) the <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">semantic relationships</em> between elements (and the grammatical relationships between words in particular). This contrasts with the typical approach of representing the image with CNN activations (which are sensitive to individual object locations but less so to relative position) and the processing words of the question serially with an RNN (despite the fact that grammatical structure is very non-linear). The graph representation ignores the order in which elements are processed, but instead represents the relationships between different elements using different edge types. Our network uses multiple layers that iterate over the features associated with every node, then ultimately identifies a soft matching between nodes from the two graphs. This matching reflects the correspondences between the words in the question and the objects in the image. The features of the matched nodes then feed into a classifier to infer the answer to the question (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>Architecture of the proposed neural network. The input is provided as a description of the scene (a list of objects with their visual characteristics) and a parsed question (words with their syntactic relations). The scene-graph contains a node with a feature vector for each object, and edge features that represent their spatial relationships. The question-graph reflects the parse tree of the question, with a word embedding for each node, and a vector embedding of types of syntactic dependencies for edges. A recurrent unit (GRU) is associated with each node of both graphs. Over multiple iterations, the GRU updates a representation of each node that integrates context from its neighbours within the graph. Features of all objects and all words are combined (concatenated) pairwise, and they are weighted with a form of attention. That effectively matches elements between the question and the scene. The weighted sum of features is passed through a final classifier that predicts scores over a fixed set of candidate answers.</figcaption>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of visual question answering has received increasing interest since the seminal paper of Antol <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Most recent methods are based on the idea of a <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">joint embedding</span> of the image and the question using a deep neural network. The image is passed through a convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained for image classification, from which intermediate features are extracted to describe the image. The question is typically passed through a recurrent neural network (RNN) such as an LSTM, which produces a fixed-size vector representing the sequence of words. These two representations are mapped to a joint space by one or several non-linear layers. They can then be fed into a classifier over an output vocabulary, predicting the final answer. Most recent papers on VQA propose improvements and variations on this basic idea. Consult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> for a survey.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A major improvement to the basic method is to use an <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">attention mechanism</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. It models interactions between specific parts of the inputs (image and question) depending on their actual contents. The visual input is then typically represented a spatial feature map, instead of holistic, image-wide features. The feature map is used with the question to determine spatial weights that reflect the most relevant regions of the image. Our approach uses a similar weighting operation, which, with our graph representation, we equate to a subgraph matching. Graph nodes representing question words are associated with graph nodes representing scene objects and vice versa. Similarly, the co-attention model of Lu <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> determines attention weights on both image regions and question words. Their best-performing approach proceeds in a sequential manner, starting with question-guided visual attention followed by image-guided question attention. In our case, we found that a joint, one-pass version performs better.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A major contribution of our model is to use <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">structured representations</span> of the input scene and the question. This contrasts with typical CNN and RNN models which are limited to spatial feature maps and sequences of words respectively. The dynamic memory networks (DMN), applied to VQA in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> also maintain a set-like representation of the input. As in our model, the DMN models interactions between different parts of the input. Our method can additionally take, as input, features characterizing arbitrary relations between parts of the input (the edge features in our graphs). This specifically allows making use of syntactic dependencies between words after pre-parsing the question.</p>

The approach most similar to ours is the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which associate a gated recurrent unit (GRU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>) to each node, and updates the feature vector of each node by iteratively passing messages between neighbours. Also related is the work of Vinyals <em id="S2.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> for embedding a set into fixed-size vector, invariant to the order of its elements. They do so by feeding the entire set through a recurrent unit multiple times. Each iteration uses an attention mechanism to focus on different parts of the set. Our formulation similarly incorporates information from neighbours into each node feature over multiple iterations, but we did not find any advantage in using an attention mechanism within the recurrent unit.</p>

In our implementation, we found the best performance with the average function, taking care of averaging over the variable number of connected neighbours. An intuitive interpretation of the recurrent processing is to progressively integrate context information from connected neighbours into each node’s own representation.
A node corresponding to the word ’ball’, for instance, might thus incorporate the fact that the associated adjective is ’red’. Our formulation is similar but slightly different from the gated graph networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, as the propagation of information in our model is limited to the first order.
Note that our graphs are typically densely connected.</p>

The pairs of complementary scenes also typically differ by only one or two objects being displaced, removed, or slightly modified (see examples in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Evaluation on the “abstract scenes” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, bottom rows).

<p id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It has been argued that the “balanced” dataset can better evaluate a method’s level of visual understanding than other datasets, because it is less susceptible to the use of language priors and dataset regularities (<em id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> guessing from the question<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>). Our initial experiments confirmed that the performances of various algorithms on the balanced dataset were indeed better separated, and we used it for our ablative analysis. We also focus on the hardest evaluation setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which measures the accuracy over <em id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">pairs</em> of complementary scenes. This is the only metric in which blind models (guessing from the question) obtain null accuracy. This setting also does not consider pairs of test scenes deemed ambiguous because of disagreement between annotators. Each test scene is still evaluated independently however, so the model is unable to increase performance by forcing opposite answers to pairs of questions.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our method against the three models proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. They all use an ensemble of models exploiting either an LSTM for processing the question, or an elaborate set of hand-designed rules to identify two objects as the focus of the question. The visual features in the three models are respectively empty (blind model), global (scene-wide), or focused on the two objects identified from the question. These models are specifically designed for binary questions, whereas ours is generally applicable. Nevertheless, we obtain significantly better accuracy than all three (Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Ablative evaluation ‣ 5.1 Evaluation on the “balanced” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Differences in performance are mostly visible in the “pairs” setting, which we believe is more reliable as it discards ambiguous test questions on which human annotators disagreed.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.3" class="ltx_p">During training, we take care to keep pairs of complementary scenes together when forming mini-batches. This has a significant positive effect on the stability of the optimization. Interestingly, we did not notice any tendency toward overfitting when training on balanced scenes.

Most existing VQA methods treat the answering as a hard classification over candidate answers, and almost all reported results consist of a single accuracy metric. To provide more insight, we produce precision/recall curves for predicted answers.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We compare models trained with either a softmax or a sigmoid as the final non-linearity (Eq. <a href="#S4.E9" title="In 4 Processing graphs with neural networks ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>). The common practice is to train the softmax for a hard classification objective, using a cross-entropy loss and the answer of highest ground truth score as the target. In an attempt to make better use of the multiple human-provided answers, we propose to use the <em id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">soft</em> ground truth scores as the target with a logarithmic loss. This shows an advantage on the “abstract scenes” dataset (Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Metrics ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, left and middle). In that dataset, the soft target scores reflect frequent ambiguities in the questions and the scenes, and when synonyms constitute multiple acceptable answers. In those cases, we can avoid the potential confusion induced by a hard classification for one specific answer. The “balanced” dataset, by nature, contains almost no such ambiguities, and there is no significant difference between the different training objectives (Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Metrics ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, right).</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our motivation for introducing language parsing and pretrained word embeddings is to better generalize the concepts learned from the limited training examples. Words representing semantically close concepts ideally get assigned close word embeddings. Similarly, paraphrases of similar questions should produce parse graphs with more similarities than a simple concatenation of words would reveal (as in the input to traditional LSTMs).</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We trained our model with limited subsets of the training data (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Ablative evaluation ‣ 5.1 Evaluation on the “balanced” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). Unsurprisingly, the performance grows steadily with the amount of training data, which suggests that larger datasets would improve performance. In our opinion however, it seems unlikely that sufficient data, covering all possible concepts, could be collected in the form of question/answer examples. More data can however be brought in with other sources of information and supervision. Our use of parsing and word embeddings is a small step in that direction. Both techniques clearly improve generalization (Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Ablative evaluation ‣ 5.1 Evaluation on the “balanced” dataset ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). The effect may be particularly visible in our case because of the relatively small number of training examples (about <math id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">20</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1.1">20</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1.m1.1c">20</annotation></semantics></math>k questions in the “balanced” dataset).

Anecdotally, performance on the validation set corroborates all findings presented above, in particular the strong benefit of pre-parsing, pretrained word embeddings, and graph processing with a GRU. At the time of our submission, our method occupies the top place on the leader board in both the open-ended and multiple choice settings. The advantage over existing method is most pronounced on the binary and the counting questions.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a deep neural network for visual question answering that processes graph-structured representations of scenes and questions. This enables leveraging existing natural language processing tools, in particular pretrained word embeddings and syntactic parsing. The latter showed significant advantage over a traditional sequential processing of the questions, <em id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> with LSTMs. In our opinion, VQA systems are unlikely to learn everything from question/answer examples alone. We believe that any significant improvement in performance will require additional sources of information and supervision. Our explicit processing of the language part is a small step in that direction. It has clearly shown to improve generalization without resting entirely on VQA-specific annotations. We have so far applied our method to datasets of clip art scenes. Its direct extension to real images will be addressed in future work, by replacing nodes in the input scene graph with proposals from pretrained object detectors.</p>

<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The balanced dataset of abstract scenes was the only one allowing evaluation free from dataset biases. Abstract scenes also enabled removing confounding factors (visual recognition). It is not unreasonable to view the scene descriptions (provided with abstract scenes) as the output of a “perfect” vision system. The proposel model could be extended to real images by building graphs of the images where scene nodes are candidates from an object detection algorithm.</p>
