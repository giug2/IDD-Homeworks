<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning (BFL) enables mobile devices to collaboratively train neural network models required by a Machine Learning Model Owner (MLMO) while keeping data on the mobile devices. Then, the model updates are stored in the blockchain in a decentralized and reliable manner. However, the issue of BFL is that the mobile devices have energy and CPU constraints that may reduce the system lifetime and training efficiency. The other issue is that the training latency may increase due to the blockchain mining process. To address these issues, the MLMO needs to (i) decide how much data and energy that the mobile devices use for the training and (ii) determine the block generation rate to minimize the system latency, energy consumption, and incentive cost while achieving the target accuracy for the model. Under the uncertainty of the BFL environment, it is challenging for the MLMO to determine the optimal decisions. We propose to use the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to derive the optimal decisions for the MLMO.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the privacy issue of the traditional machine learning, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has recently been proposed as an efficient solution that allows mobile devices to cooperatively train a Neural Network (NN) model required by the Machine Learning Model Owner (MLMO), e.g., a server. In particular, the MLMO first transmits the NN model, i.e., global model, to the mobile devices. The mobile devices use their local data to train the model. They then transmit the trained NN models, i.e., the local models, to the MLMO. The MLMO aggregates the local models to the new global model. The MLMO can send the new global model back to the mobile devices for the training. The above steps can be repeated until the global model achieves a certain accuracy. The MLMO pays rewards to the mobile devices for their contributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since FL communicates the NN model updates, i.e., model’s weights, while keeping the data on the mobile devices, it addresses the privacy issue of the traditional machine learning. However, the model updates from the mobile devices and the payment records are still centralized at the MLMO. Therefore, FL faces issues related to the malfunction and the unreliability of the MLMO. In particular, any fault or malfunction of the MLMO, e.g., due to hardware failure or attack, can break the model update communications between the MLMO and the mobile devices. Also, payment records as a financial evidence may be lost or damaged. As a result, the training process needs to be re-initialized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This calls for a reliable and secure data management scheme for the model updates and the payment records in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, blockchain has been proposed as an efficient data management approach in FL. Blockchain is used to store and secure reputations of the mobile devices in FL as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Moreover, it can be used to prevent malicious mobile devices in FL as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Especically, blockchain is introduced to store the model updates of FL as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Indeed, blockchain is considered to be a decentralized database, i.e., a ledger in which transactions are recorded and processed by a number of blockchain nodes, i.e., miners, over the whole network. Such a decentralized database structure addresses the malfunction issue of the MLMO, and it also allows the mobile devices and the MLMO to easily upload and download the model updates. Moreover, blockchain enhances the security and guarantees the data integrity since the transactions must be agreed and verified by the nodes before they are recorded. As such, blockchain can be combined with FL, called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning (BFL)</span>, for efficiently and securely storing the model updates and the payment records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, BFL has two major limitations. First, the training latency may increase due to the mining process of the miners in blockchain. The latency increase significantly as the block generation rate decreases. Second, the mobile devices in FL have energy and CPU constraints that may reduce the network lifetime and efficiency of training tasks. To overcome these limitations, the MLMO should decide (i) appropriate amounts of data and energy that the mobile devices use for the training and (ii) the block generation rate in the blockchain
system to minimize the system latency and energy consumption
while achieving the certain model accuracy. However, it is challenging for the MLMO to determine the optimal decisions because the BFL environment, i.e., including the mobile and blockchain environments, are dynamic and uncertain. In this paper, we develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based scheme to derive optimal decisions for the MLMO without any prior knowledge
of the network. For this, we first describe the BFL system in which the blockchain system is modeled as an M/M/1 queue system. We then formulate the BFL’s problem as a stochastic optimization problem. To solve the problem, we adopt the DRL with Deep Q-Network (DQN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL scheme outperforms the baseline schemes
in terms of energy consumption, training latency, and cost.</p>

The use of the orthogonal channels is to guarantee that there is no interference among the devices. The MLMO first sends a request to the devices through the BS (Step 1 in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II System Model ‣ Resource Management for Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The request includes an initial global model for training and a record of payments. The payments are monetary rewards as incentives paid to the devices and the miners for their contributions. The payments imply how much resource, i.e., energy and data units, should be used by the devices and what value of blockchain mining/generation rate is used by the miners. Then, each device uses its local dataset, energy and CPU resources to train the global model (Step 2).
After finishing the training, the device generates a transaction that includes the local model update and the record of payments made by the MLMO in the Step 1. The device sends the transaction to its associated miner (Step 3).
The miner that receives the transactions from their associated devices broadcasts the transactions to the other miners. All the transactions are stored in the miners’ queues for being added into blocks. This process is called <span id="S2.SS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-verification</span> (Step 4) which enables the transactions to be synchronized among miners. Next, the miners start mining (Step 5) by using their computation power to solve a cryptographic puzzle as Proof of Work (PoW). The first miner that finds the solution is the mining winner and is authorized to generate a new block.
The mining winner then adds a certain amount of transactions into the newly generated block and propagates the block to other miners (Step 6). Other miners receive the block, verify the transactions and add the block to their local blockchain.
Finally, the MLMO aggregates the transactions from the blockchain and generates a new global model (Step 7). The above steps can be repeated in the next iteration until the global model achieves a certain accuracy. Note that before each iteration, the mobile devices communicate their availability of resources, i.e., energy, with the MLMO.</p>

The transactions are stored in the memory of the miners before being added into the next blocks. The blockchain blocks that are generated by the mining is also modeled by a Poisson process.

Meanwhile, the MLMO needs to determine an appropriate block generation rate of the blockchain. A low block generation rate can decrease the cost paid to the miners, but the system latency is high. In contrast, the high block generation rate decreases the latency, but the cost paid to the miners may be high since the miners consume more computing power to complete the mining process.</p>

However, the Q-learning may not be efficient to find an optimal policy when the state and action spaces are large.
Thus, we propose to use the DQN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a combination of Q-learning and deep learning, to find the optimal policy for the MLMO.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented the DRL scheme for the resource management in the BFL system. We have first described the BFL system in which the blockchain network is modeled as an M/M/1 queue. Then, we have formulated the stochastic optimization problem for the resource management of the MLMO. We have developed a DRL scheme to solve the problem. Simulation results show that the DRL scheme outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of energy consumption and training latency with reasonable cost.</p>
