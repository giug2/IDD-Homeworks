<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The metaverse, envisioned as the next digital frontier for avatar-based virtual interaction, involves high-performance models. In this dynamic environment, users’ tasks frequently shift, requiring fast model personalization despite limited data. This evolution consumes extensive resources and requires vast data volumes. To address this, meta-learning emerges as an invaluable tool for metaverse users, with federated meta-learning (FML), offering even more tailored solutions owing to its adaptive capabilities. However, the metaverse is characterized by users heterogeneity with diverse data structures, varied tasks, and uneven sample sizes, potentially undermining global training outcomes due to statistical difference. Given this, an urgent need arises for smart coalition formation that accounts for these disparities. This paper introduces a dual game-theoretic framework for metaverse services involving meta-learners as workers to manage FML. A blockchain-based cooperative coalition formation game is crafted, grounded on a reputation metric, user similarity, and incentives. We also introduce a novel reputation system based on users’ historical contributions and potential contributions to present tasks, leveraging correlations between past and new tasks. Finally, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is presented to attract reliable workers to participate in meta-learning, minimizing users’ energy costs, increasing payoffs, boosting FML efficacy, and improving metaverse utility. Results show that our dual game framework outperforms best-effort, random, and non-uniform clustering schemes - improving training performance by up to 10%, cutting completion times by as much as 30%, enhancing metaverse utility by more than 25%, and offering up to 5% boost in training efficiency over non-blockchain systems, effectively countering misbehaving users.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the concept of metaverse has gained considerable attention, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic’s constraints on physical mobility and the interests of major tech companies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Through customizable 3D avatars, users can engage in activities mirroring real-life experiences within this shared virtual reality. The advancement of metaverse technology has substantially reduced the barriers between physical and digital worlds, aided by technologies like digital twins, blockchain, extended reality (XR), and AI algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As this digital frontier evolves, high-performing AI models are required to ensure a seamless user experience and real-time rendering. However, a significant challenge arises from the scarcity of data within each user’s individual context and the need for frequent model personalization due to the ever-shifting nature of tasks. These dynamics demand extensive resources, vast data volumes, and high learning time to train robust and adaptive models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome this limitation and enhance model performance, a collective training approach, Federated Learning (FL), is required, facilitating collaborative model refinement across decentralized devices. The integration of Federated Learning in the metaverse (FL4M) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> promises enhanced data privacy and security, alongside decentralized machine learning that leverages user-generated data and computational resources for model building. Yet, in the metaverse, effective management of heterogeneous data is crucial to maintain data utility. In FL, data heterogeneity arises due to diverse client data characteristics, often exhibiting non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) properties, affecting model accuracy. This heterogeneity is not limited to data characteristics; indeed, the metaverse has enormous number of users, objects, and interactions, which creates scalability challenges for traditional FL algorithms. Users may have different preferences, devices, and learning tasks, which can create challenges to adapt to the behavior of the avatars, pursue the ever-shifting nature of their tasks, and provide a more personalized experience, especially that FL mainly focuses on learning one ML task across multiple devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, users expect a responsive and adaptive virtual environment, which cannot be achieved through FL that requires long re-training. Addressing these multifaceted heterogeneity aspects is crucial for efficient FL solutions in the metaverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Meta-Learning (FML), known as "learning to learn", emerges as a solution to tackle multi-task learning challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, while preserving the benefits of Federated Learning, such as data security and flexibility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Particularly, initialization-based meta-learning algorithms are well known for fast adaptation and strong generalization to new tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In other words, it enables a model to adapt swiftly to new tasks by using its prior experience from other tasks in real-time. As an illustrative example, in a vehicular metaverse, distinct users engage within similar virtual environments but with differing tasks and objectives, such as optimizing fuel efficiency and improving driving techniques. FML demonstrates its prowess by seamlessly accommodating these divergent tasks using different data and offering personalized virtual driving models catering to each user’s unique needs. Additionally, FML considers evolving tasks within the metaverse, such as simulating snowy roads, efficiently personalizing previously generated models with minimal data samples, computation resources, and learning latency.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite its promising benefits, FML comes with new challenges in the metaverse. Specifically, three critical issues must be addressed. First, the metaverse has a vast number of heterogeneous users with diverse data structures, tasks, and sample sizes, making collective training inefficient due to unrelated tasks and leading to low convergence speed with random uniform device selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Non-uniform device selection widely applied for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> face challenges in FML due to bias, statistical heterogeneity, and high-order information in stochastic gradients. Excluding meta-learners with minimal contributions, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, is not feasible in the metaverse, where users actively seek participation to craft personalized experiences. Therefore, a clustering mechanism should be wisely designed to group metaverse users based on their tasks and data similarity. Coalition formation games have been introduced in the context of FL to support Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or to optimize communication resource efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the high diversity of tasks within the metaverse poses a challenge, making conventional clustering methods unsuitable for direct application.
Secondly, some metaverse users may misbehave to selfishly increase their utility, resulting in a bad training experience. Hence, clustering mechanism should consider the presence of unreliable users to create a fair training circumstances among different coalitions in order to minimize the impact on each coalition’s training performance. Third, users’ devices may be unwilling to engage in metaverse services due to resource allocation concerns, energy consumption, and the absence of appropriate incentives. While resource allocation and incentive mechanisms for FL have been the focus of extensive research, particularly for metaverse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, FML remains underexplored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a framework that manages the usage of federated meta-learning to empower metaverse services. Our novel distributed computing framework integrates FML techniques with blockchain technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> to address the unique challenges of the metaverse previously discussed and pave the way for efficient and personalized learning strategies. The framework introduces a dual game mechanism consisting of a cooperative coalition formation game for clustering metaverse meta-learners and a Stackelberg game for resource allocation and incentives, which are novel approaches not explored before in the context of FML. On one hand, the coalition formation game clusters metaverse meta-learners based on their tasks similarities, contributions and reputations, addressing the inefficiencies caused by statistical heterogeneity and ensuring average reliability of each coalition. On the other hand, the Stackelberg game serves as an incentive mechanism to ensure fair payoff distribution among metaverse users within each coalition according to their contribution. The framework operates in steps process, starting with users requesting personalized meta-models from a metaverse service provider and concluding with the update of different models and reputations of users after each FML round. Throughout training rounds where both games interact, our framework enables efficient meta-training, enhances users contributions and payoffs, and reduces energy costs while promoting collaboration and fairness among them. Blockchain technology underpins the framework, to securely manage reputations and incentives, track participation, and ensure transparent interactions among metaverse entities.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The metaverse has gained significant attention, driving research into integrating advanced technologies and AI techniques, such as digital twin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, XR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and semantic learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Federated learning has particularly garnered interest for its ability to ensure data privacy and leverage user resources in the metaverse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For example, Zhou et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed an optimization framework for FL in mobile augmented reality within the metaverse, focusing on minimizing energy consumption and completion time while improving model accuracy. Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> explored a privacy-preserving FL framework for the industrial metaverse using blockchain. However, these works primarily focused on resource and time performance, overlooking the critical aspect of data heterogeneity among learners. Zeng et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> presented HFedMS, an FL system for the industrial metaverse that addresses data heterogeneity and learning forgetting through clients regrouping and semantic compression and compensation. Most of federated learning efforts in the metaverse, including HFedMS, aim to address the core issue which is data heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the metaverse’s heterogeneity extends beyond data characteristics and user preferences, encompassing system and protocol variations that challenge traditional FL. Furthermore, the dynamic and personalized nature of the metaverse, with users having evolving and diverse tasks, poses additional challenges for FL algorithms, which primarily focus on learning a single task across devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Efficiently addressing these multifaceted heterogeneity issues is crucial for enhancing collaborative training performance within the metaverse’s unique ecosystem, which is the focus of this paper. Federated Meta-Learning offers a promising solution by enabling fast adaptation to new tasks and heterogeneous users, increasing learning accuracy for diverse multi-task environments, and allowing diverse metaverse users to handle a wide range of scenarios and contexts. Despite its advantages, FML has not been integrated or adapted for the metaverse, leaving user-specific needs unmet. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the integration and adaptation of FML techniques to cater to the tasks-heterogeneity of users in the metaverse dynamic environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent literature shows growing interest in FML, with efforts focusing only on enhancing model convergence and accuracy through optimized loss functions and averaging methods for general applications. Among these mainstream works, Chen et al. introduced FedMeta, an FML method enhancing FL and FedAvg through a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> for high statistical and systematic challenges. Jiang et al. explored the relationship between MAML and FedAvg, demonstrating improved and stable personalized performance offered by FML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Lin et al. analyzed FML convergence considering adversarial data and strongly convex loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, while Fallah et al. confirmed FML’s convergence in non-convex scenarios with stochastic gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The FML algorithms described above frequently face challenges with slow convergence and inefficient communication due to random device selection. Non-uniform device selection has been proposed in meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which involves the exclusion of users with minimal contributions to the training. This approach is impractical in metaverse, as users actively seek participation to create personalized experiences. Clustering all active users looking for a customized experience according to their tasks and context similarities, is not explored in the literature. Our paper will not focus on enhancing loss and averaging performance as is common in existing works, where well-established techniques prevail. Instead, we aim to bridge a significant gap by proposing a novel method for dynamic clustering tailored to the unique needs of the metaverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another critical gap in FML literature is the lack of comprehensive strategies for effective resource allocation in distributed device environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Unlike FML, Federated Learning has seen considerable research dedicated to enhancing clustering, users selection, and resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. He et al. propose a three-stage Stackelberg game-enabled clustered federated learning approach for heterogeneous UAV swarms, where game-theoretic framework is employed to optimize learning, resource consumption, and incentive allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Ng et al. also propose a reputation-aware hedonic coalition formation approach for efficient serverless hierarchical FL, enabling participants to form stable coalitions based on their preferences and reputations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Kang et al. introduce an incentive mechanism that combines reputation and contract theory to ensure reliability and honest user participation in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Zhu et al. present a dynamic incentive and reputation mechanism to promote energy efficiency and motivate user participation in FL for 6G networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Allahham et al. develop a Stackelberg game approach to incentivize learners in multi-orchestrator mobile edge learning environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It is worth noting that several studies have explored resource allocation techniques based on hierarchical and Stackelberg game frameworks and AI techniques in edge and cloud computing systems, such as the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. These approaches consider the dynamic nature of users and their influence on resource allocation.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While FL has been extensively researched, FML remains underexplored, and the clustering and selection techniques developed for FL cannot be directly applicable to FML due to higher-order information and biased stochastic gradients.

Additionally, we have designed a novel dual-game framework that utilizes coalitions to enhance training efficiency and a Stackelberg game to incentivize users to contribute their resources and improve the utility of the metaverse.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework introduces a novel integration of federated meta-learning within the metaverse, leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized management of interactions among metaverse Meta-Learners (MMLs). At its core, the framework is designed to ensure reliable and real-time personalized experiences through a dual game managing metaverse users and their contributions to the FML process. Specifically, the process unfolds in seven sequential steps, beginning with MMLs requesting meta-models from a metaverse Service Provider (MSP) and concluding with the MSP updating the requested models and reputations of MMLs post each FML round. Central to this process is the cooperative coalition formation game clustering MMLs based on utility maximization, and a Stackelberg game framework for optimal task allocation and incentives distribution. Blockchain technology underpins the framework, managing the reputations of MMLs through a decentralized and tamper-proof mechanism, securing transactions between MMLs and the MSP, and ensuring that incentives are distributed fairly and transparently. It also records all interactions, formed coalitions and MMLs’ contributions, thereby providing an immutable and trusted history that can be referenced for future coalition formation, tasks allocation, incentives distribution, and reputation updates. Details about this process are introduced as follows:</p>

In cooperative games, the MMLs which are self-interested and focus on maximizing their own utilities, exhibit preferences regarding the clusters they wish to join
based on their statistical similarity to the head, the incentives they can gain, and the computation energy cost. As such, their utilities are influenced solely by the members of the coalitions they are part of. Throughout the game, coalitions may need to be dynamically adjusted. The miners are responsible in updating the reputation scores of each participant, recalculating utilities, and ensuring that new coalitions remain beneficial to all members involved. Once a coalition is formed, the miners record on the blockchain the final coalitions in addition to the combinations that did not lead to a Nash stability.</p>

In this game setup, the MSP acts as the leader across all coalitions, thereby dictating the reward strategy. Simultaneously, the MMLs, comprising both the members and the heads of the coalitions, function as followers who fine-tune their computing speed strategies. This arrangement highlights that distinct games occur within each coalition, despite the MSP’s overarching the leadership across all games.

Once the coalitions are formed, the MML receives the current global model from the head and computes its local model using its own dataset. During the communication phase, the MML devices send their local models to the respective head via wireless nodes. After that, each head aggregates the received models and starts the following round. For the sake of simplicity, we omit the consideration of downlink communication due to the asymmetric uplink-downlink nature of wireless networks. This implies that the transmission power and downlink communication bandwidth, typically stronger at the server (e.g., a base station), make the downlink time negligible compared to uplink data transmission time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

Additionally, each MML adopts the dynamic voltage scaling technology, enabling adaptive modification and management of their processing speed to obtain a higher profit. On the other hand, participating with the computing resources costs the MML energy. Hence, each participant’s utility is calculated as the difference between the acquired rewards and the consumed energy. A rational MML will keep its utility function positive. It is also imperative that each user ensures their task completion time does not exceed the tolerated limit (<math id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T^{j}_{max}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1a"><msubsup id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.cmml">T</mi><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1a" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.4" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.4.cmml">x</mi></mrow><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3.cmml">j</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2">𝑇</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3">𝑗</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3"><times id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3">𝑎</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.4">𝑥</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.7.m7.1c">T^{j}_{max}</annotation></semantics></math>) required by the head <math id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="h_{j}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1a"><msub id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">h</mi><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">j</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2">ℎ</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3">𝑗</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.8.m8.1c">h_{j}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Specifically, the metaverse environment is composed of users with different data structures and various tasks. To avoid random grouping of users and unstable global training performance caused by statistical heterogeneity, we encourage the collaboration between MMLs with similar data and tasks.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.28" class="ltx_p">An embedding is a relatively low-dimensional space into which high-dimensional vectors (e.g., images) are transformed. In machine learning, embeddings are the output of <span id="S4.SS1.p2.28.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Embedding layer</span>, which is the last layer before the head of the model. Embeddings function as task-specific dictionaries that capture some of the semantics of the inputs by placing semantically similar inputs close together in the embedding space. Thus, the similarity between two embeddings can provide insight into the similarity between the two tasks to be learned and, therefore, can help to proactively select the relevant metaverse users that can be trained together led by their head. The embedding can be obtained by a simple forward pass through the model with a reduced complexity. Moreover, it is considered a low-dimensional output. Hence, we will neglect its generation and transmission costs.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">The global reputation captures the historical performance of active MMLs within the metaverse system, reflecting their cumulative contributions across various training rounds and coalitions. To give prominence to recent contributions, we introduce contribution freshness metric. This is essential as a user’s data and integrity can change over time. Furthermore, an honest user may be hijacked maliciously or may falsify its contribution (e.g., quality of data and computation resources). Thus, the global reputation is expressed as follows:</p>

Specifically, it is imperative that the heads are trusted to prevent any potential misleading of the training process. This concern arises if a head misbehaves and modifies its embedding, consequently misguiding data similarity to other players. Such behavior could ultimately affect the formation of coalitions. Furthermore, each head should be one of the players presenting a strict constraint in task completion time, so that the algorithm can guarantee to deliver the trained models within the time requirements of most metaverse users. Note that our algorithm will not ensure that all MMLs receive their models within their time requirements; instead, it ensures a trade-off between reputation and completion time (line 12).</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The interaction between the MSP and the MMLs is formulated as a single-leader multi-followers Stackelberg game. Within this framework, the MSP assumes the role of the leader, strategically determining the optimal competition incentives to encourage MMLs to execute meta-learning tasks. On the other hand, the MMLs, as followers, adapt their computation frequencies to increase their individual profits. The strategies of both the MSP and the MMLs are formulated as follows:</p>

From the MSP’s optimal strategy, the MMLs’ optimal strategies can be derived. As a result, the proposed model ensures the achievement of the Stackelberg equilibrium.
This equilibrium allows the MSP to maximize its utility and the MMLs to guarantee optimal profit, without incentive to modify their strategies for increased gains.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework employs dual game-theory, as summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ V-B Dual Game-theoretic Federated Meta-Learning algorithm ‣ V Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism for metaverse ‣ A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, named GFML. The algorithm begins with an initialization step, involving random head selection and coalition formation. Subsequently, during each training round, coalitions undergo adjustments through the cooperative coalition formation game, based on the embeddings generated from the heads models, reputations, and allocated resources. Once coalitions are established, we fine-tune the computations of MMLs and the rewards provided by the MSP through the Stackelberg game strategy. This process aims to maximize the utility of the service provider and increase user profits. Each MML then carries out local training, guided by its computing frequency derived from the game. Local model results are aggregated within the heads, and reputations are updated based on their respective contributions. As we move forward to the next round, the coalition formation game takes into account these new reputations and computation capabilities, ensuring a dynamic and adaptive approach to our framework’s operation.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our evaluation, we use two widely used benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST and MNIST. The data from these benchmarks are distributed across 40 devices, with each device holding samples from two randomly chosen classes and the number of samples per class adhering to a quantity-based label distribution. We utilize the FedLab library<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://fedlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html</span></span></span> for data partitioning. Randomly selected 90% of the devices serve as active MMLs, leaving the remainder passive. For each device, the local dataset is split, allocating 90% for training and 10% for testing. Furthermore, our starting model is a deep neural network with Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function, containing three fully connected layers with sizes 80, 60, and 10. It is worth noting that employing more complex neural networks would improve the results of our framework and baseline methods, yet relative performance would stay the same. For aggregation, we use the Personalized FedAvg (Per-FedAvg HF) algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. To validate the performance of our proposed framework, we consider multiple baselines:</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We can also see that the random coalition formation is unstable and has a low convergence speed, which is also due to bias and statistical heterogeneity. In GFML, when we opt for random frequency generation instead of optimized computational resources and incentives using Stackelberg game, our proposed scheme presents unstable and slower convergence and lower accuracy. This is explained by the inconsistency in computational contributions, leading to reputation fluctuations and consequently impacting the coalition formation game. Furthermore, the MMLs that cannot respect the completion time constraint are discarded from the meta-learning process, depriving them of a more personalized experience and hence reducing the average training performance. The same behavior can also be seen for random clustering schemes with random frequencies compared to optimized computation resources.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the fixed coalition formation demonstrates both stability and high performance due to the unchanging clusters formed based on statistical similarity. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed embeddings similarity method. Yet, GFML relies on both embeddings similarity and task-specific reputation, offering insights into each user’s potential contribution to the current task based on past task similarities. As a result, our framework excels in performance. This assertion is confirmed in Fig. <a href="#S6.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ VI Performance evaluation ‣ A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a> which depicts the average accuracy of global models prior to MML personalization. In this figure, the fixed coalition formation scheme achieves better results, as the trained models are less task-specific. Upon personalization, our proposed scheme surpasses it. We also observe that, after personalization, the fixed coalition formation using the Stackelberg game yields superior performance compared to optimizing solely the MMLs’ payoffs for the same reasons mentioned earlier.</p>

We observe that strategies, including GFML and random and fixed coalition formation, which focus solely on maximizing the profit of MMLs, effectively achieve their goal of enhancing user payoffs owing to the optimized frequencies balancing the profit and energy consumption. However, the presented MSP utility is low, as its maximization is not considered in the resource allocation optimization or the coalition formation game.
On the other hand, strategies employing the Stackelberg game successfully strike a balance between MMLs’ profit and the utility of the MSP. In particular, compared to GFML, random and fixed coalition formations yield slightly higher utility for the MSP due to users providing lower computation resources, resulting in lower costs for the service provider. However, due to these low frequency resources, their average completion time tends to be among the highest. This is not the case of our framework, constrained by stricter time constraints imposed by the dynamically selected heads. Such constraint is looser for the random and fixed coalitions where heads are either randomly selected or fixed, potentially requiring larger completion times and leading to lower computation capacities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The high task latency observed in the random formation schemes can be attributed to the arbitrary selection of heads, which might tolerate higher completion times. Our GFML approach with random frequencies results also in high completion times, primarily due to the potentially low computation resources generated arbitrary. While this approach may benefit users by lowering energy costs, it leads to minimal MSP utility due to training instability resulted from unstable coalition formation highly impacted by random frequencies. In the best effort scenario, since user utility depends partially on data size (see Eq. <a href="#S4.E10" title="In IV-A Profit function of metaverse meta-learners ‣ IV Reliable heads selection and coalition formation ‣ A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>) and given that all MMLs’s models are aggregated together and individual user data might be negligible relative to the total, the positive profit might be minor. In this case, the energy costs could result in negative incentives. Hence, when only users’ profits are optimized, the optimization boosts the computational frequency until achieving a near-zero utility, resulting in low task latency but incentives that deter active participation in metaverse services. Stackelberg game helps to achieve a balance between the MSP utility and the users’ profits in best effort strategy, although the overall system welfare remains lower than in our proposed system due to training inefficiency caused by statistical heterogeneity. To conclude, our framework presents the highest training performance while striking a balance between the profit of the users and the utility of MSP, in addition to ensuring a low average completion time. This owes to both coalition formation game relying on data similarity and historical reputation for similar tasks, and stackelberg game optimizing not only MMLs resources but also MSP profits.</p>

From the results, even with a single sample for personalization, users can attain high-performing models without direct training participation. This highlights the meta-learning efficacy in supporting immersive user experiences within the metaverse,
through optimizing models for quick adaptability to unforeseen tasks and information, enabling prompt edge learning and efficient personalization with minimal data input. Possessing additional samples for personalization further refines the model’s accuracy, bringing its performance in line with active MMLs.</p>

Notably, as the number of users decreases, accuracy tends to increase. It is worth noting that we maintain a fixed number of coalitions at 4. Fewer users imply fewer tasks and reduced complexity in terms of heterogeneity. Therefore, dividing users into 4 coalitions proves effective in addressing data and distribution disparities. However, when dealing with a larger number of highly heterogeneous users, clustering them into only 4 coalitions fails to manage task differences effectively. In this case, a higher number of coalitions is recommended when serving a larger number of metaverse users. Fig. <a href="#S6.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ VI Performance evaluation ‣ A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a> illustrates the profit of the MMLs, the utility of the MSP, and the average completion time, when varying the number of users. It is expected that with a larger user base, the utility of the MSP, calculated as the sum of utilities from each user, increases. Moreover, as the number of MMLs increases, the probability of encountering users with stricter completion time requirements also rises. Consequently, we observe that the average task completion time is the lowest when the system consists of 120 MMLs. Accordingly, their profits increase because they offer higher computation resources to meet strict time constraints.</p>

It is clear that when the number of coalitions is higher, the training performance is better. This can be attributed to the fact that clustering contributes to capture the differences between different tasks. Consequently, distributing users across more coalitions enhances task granularity and, consequently, training efficiency.</p>

For the reputation scheme without blockchain, reputation values are stored in a centralized platform, vulnerable to manipulation. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F8.sf4" title="In Figure 8 ‣ VI-A Numerical analysis of the GFML performance under an honest environment ‣ VI Performance evaluation ‣ A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(d)</span></a>, when managed by blockchain, users’ reputations diminish upon falsifying their computational contributions. In the absence of blockchain, the system experiences a decline in accuracy, yet the incentives stay high due to manipulation. Specifically, blockchain enables a tamper-proof mechanism for managing the reputations of MMLs. Falsifying computational efforts to reduce energy consumption potentially disrupts the learning process. Our system mitigates these risks by basing reputation calculations on actual contributions to the training and timely updates with new local models. Misrepresentations are detectable through poor model performance or delayed updates, negatively affecting the user’s reputation. Then, this historical reputation influences future coalition formations, ensuring that incentives for malicious behavior are minimized and guaranteeing fair training conditions across different coalitions. The incorporation of blockchain is key to this approach. Without it, data integrity could be compromised, making the system vulnerable to manipulation. Blockchain ensures that all contributions and reputations are recorded transparently and securely, preventing tampering and maintaining system performance and fairness in incentives distribution. Contrarily, in systems without blockchain, the training contributions of unreliable users are manipulated to the highest values. Blockchain ensures that such unreliable MMLs receive less incentives while preserving performance efficiency.</p>

Despite these issues, ongoing advancements aim to balance security and scalability, and costs. Furthermore, future considerations may include using blockchain to identify and penalize low-reputation users (i.e., temporary ban from the application), promoting honesty within the framework.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our novel framework leverages federated meta-learning to support metaverse services. Designed as a cooperative coalition formation game, it efficiently tackles statistical heterogeneity, training inefficiency, and real-time rendering. It also ensures reliable, transparent, and decentralized management of user interactions, using Blockchain technology. Blockchain users management is based on our proposed reputation mechanism, leveraging historical and potential contributions to refine and personalize user experiences. Initial evaluations demonstrate improvements in training performance by up to 10%, task completion times by as much as 30% over traditional clustering methods, and 5% in training efficiency over non-blockchain systems, confirming the framework’s promise in delivering tailored and trustworthy immersive experiences. Future works will consider shared embeddings privacy and incentives optimization.</p>
