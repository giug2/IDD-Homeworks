<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) collaboratively trains a shared global model depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the shared model.
We first investigate critical issue caused by noisy clients in FL and quantify the negative impact of the noisy clients in terms of the representations learned by different layers.
We have the following two key observations: (1) the noisy clients can severely impact the convergence and performance of the global model in FL, and (2) the noisy clients can induce greater bias in the deeper layers than the former layers of the global model.
Based on the above observations, we propose Fed-NCL, a framework that conducts robust federated learning with noisy clients. Specifically, Fed-NCL first
identifies the noisy clients through well estimating the data quality and model divergence. Then robust layer-wise aggregation is proposed to adaptively aggregate the local models of each client to deal with the data heterogeneity caused by the noisy clients. We further perform the label correction on the noisy clients to improve the generalization of the global model.
Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy clients.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Local clients, such as personal devices, financial institutions, or hospitals, have access to a wealth of private data. However, due to data privacy concerns, security limitations, and device availability, it is impractical to collect and store all the data from the local clients at the server center and conduct centralized training. To ensure data privacy in the learning procedure, federated learning (FL) is recently proposed as a workflow that enables local clients to collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing local private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Figure 1 represents the workflow of a typical FL framework which can be mainly divided into the following two stages: 1) the client performs local training independently based on its local data, and the trained local model is sent back to a central server, 2) the central server then aggregates the local gradient updates and generates the global model. This process iterates until a certain accuracy level of the learning model is reached. In this way, an accurate predictive model can be obtained while the user data privacy is effectively protected, as the local training data are not accessed directly.
Thus, FL has been widely adopted to support different application scenarios with high requirements of data security and privacy, such as smart retailers collecting user purchasing records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, hospitals containing a multitude of patient data for predictive health care <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and financial institutions storing highly personal data for risk prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

It is difficult to guarantee that the data collected from different institutions are clean. Different from noisy label learning, federate noisy client learning focuses on the global noisy client distribution.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite all its promise, one critical obstacle exists for FL to be viable in real-world scenarios. In general, the performance of machine learning highly depends on the data quality of the participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, carefully labeled data are usually expensive and time-consuming to collect. The data annotation process is also extremely complex even for experienced people. It is difficult to guarantee that the labels of the training data located on each client are clean, as it is impossible to ensure that all the clients can perfectly annotate the corresponding training data. Training with noisy data (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, feature noise and label noise) reduces the generalization performance of the deep learning model, since the networks can easily overfit on corrupted data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
The noisy data issue is even more serious in the FL setting, which collaboratively aggregates the global models depending on a large number of clients during the overall training process. The clients usually have entirely different standards for collecting their local data, and may contain some non-expert and uncertain sources. The use of these noisy clients often results in unreliable labels and harms the global aggregated model.
Unfortunately, standard FL aggregation methods, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, ignore the noisy client issue and develop the global model directly based on the trained model from each participating client.
Thus, the overall performance of FL can be negatively impacted by the noisy clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many machine learning (ML) techniques have been developed to handle noisy data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> in the centralized setting. The state-of-the-art noisy learning methods have shown significant improvement by re-weighting training samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or applying a disagreement constraint between different networks/training strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, these noisy learning methods cannot be applied in FL workflow directly.
First, the local training data is inaccessible to the central server. Thus, it cannot remove/re-weight the noisy data during the global model aggregation.
Second, different from the single dataset in standard ML, FL has several independent local clients, which have different noisy data distributions. This makes it difficult to estimate the unified noise transition matrix used in noisy learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Third, some clients (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, battery-powered mobile devices) in FL may have limited computing resources, so that the specific noise adaptation layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> or additional collaborative network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> cannot be satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Training the collaborative model with noisy label data in FL has recently gained more attention. Some methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> utilize the extra clean data to identify the clients with noisy labels and mitigate their negative impact by re-weighting during the global model aggregation. Yang <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> first select the confident data to train the local model and perform label correction on noisy label data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However, these existing methods are still not effective and stable in the real-world setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> for the following reasons.
First, from the perspective of noisy clients, they assume all the clients have the same noise degree instead of heterogeneous noise distribution, which is not practical in the real-world scenario.
Second, they rely on the benchmark data to detect the clients with noisy label data and select the confident training data of noisy clients, which is hard to satisfy in the real-world scenario since it restricts the task-generalization of FL.
Third, most methods only consider the effectiveness without understanding how the noisy clients affect each layer of the global model.
Thus, a framework that can effectively identify noisy clients and conduct robust learning without relying on benchmark data is urgently required for FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we first analyze the problem of noisy client in FL<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In generally, there are two types of noise as: feature and label noises <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Here, we only consider the label noise case, because the feature noise could be treated with the similar way.</span></span></span>, model the noise levels among the clients with two distributions (e.g., Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions) to better emulate heterogeneous noisy scenarios in the real-world federated system. Then, to identify how the noisy clients affect the global model in FL, we first perform the experimental study on the performance of the global model and convergence rate when the noisy clients exist. We observe that the noisy data existing in participating clients can negatively impact the convergence and performance of the aggregated global model in FL. Moreover, we dig deeper to investigate how noisy clients affect each layer of the global model in federated learning. Specifically, we utilize the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> to measure each layer’s output feature similarity between the noisy clients and the global model. The observation is that the noisy clients can induce greater bias in the deeper layers than the former layers of the global model when directly using the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to aggregate all clients’ models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above observation, we propose Fed-NCL, a Federated Noisy Client Learning framework, which effectively tackle the noisy clients in FL without relying on the benchmark data.
In Fed-NCL, we detect noisy clients through modeling the reliability score distribution among the participating clients. The reliability score jointly considers each client’s local model divergence with global model and its data quality. Based on the observation that the deeper layer’s feature extraction ability in the noisy clients’ model heavily declined, a noise robust layer-wise aggregation is designed to aggregate the feedback model from each client by considering each layer’s divergence and guiding the global model update’s direction like clean clients. In order to fully utilize the local data from noisy clients to improve the generalization of the global model, we further perform the label correction on the noisy clients.

However, these existing approaches cannot be directly adopted in FL scenarios for the following two reasons. First, in order to preserve data privacy, the central server cannot access the raw training data located on each client. Second, the computational overhead caused by introducing an extra network in the training process can highly impact the energy efficiency and user experience for battery-powered clients in FL (<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, smartphones and wearable devices).</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works about FL with noisy labels can be summarized into the following two main categories: 1) Benchmark data-dependent methods and 2) Label correction-based methods. The Benchmark data-dependent methods extract the subset of clean clients or data with clean labels using public benchmark data.
FOCUS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> exploits the benchmark data stored in the server to evaluate all participant clients’ models to adjust their weight of global model aggregation.
DS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> selects the confident samples by estimating the similarity between the client’s training data and benchmark data from the server. The label correction-based methods first train the global model with the client’s confident samples and then performs the label correction on the client’s data with noisy labels. For instance, RoFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> utilizes label correction while training the sample with small loss to create local centroids and exchange them between clients and servers. CLC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> utilizes the consensus-defined class-wise information to identify the noisy labels data on the clients and correct them.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods have the following critical limitations. First, they don’t consider the heterogeneous noise distributions across different clients, assuming all the clients have the same noise degree.
Second, some approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have the strong assumptions that the server exists the benchmark data, which is hard to satisfy in real-world applications.
Moreover, the above methods only extend the existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> from centralized learning to the federated setting, they lack a deep understanding of how the noisy clients affect each layer of the global model in FL.

However, the noise scenario in FL is different from the label noise in standard ML. The noise modeling of standard ML only focuses on a single training dataset, while FL has multiple clients with their own private datasets. Thus, we focus on the noise distribution among all the participating clients.
In this section, we present the problem statement of federated learning with noisy clients, and model the noisy clients with different distributions.</p>

However, some of the participating clients are noisy clients, which means that some of the local models have memorized corrupted labels. Thus, directly aggregating these models using Eq. (<a href="#S3.E3" title="Equation 3 ‣ III-A Federated Learning with Noisy Client ‣ III Problem Statement ‣ Federated Noisy Client Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) leads the update of the global model to a divergent direction, and the generalization of the global model is severely impacted correspondingly. Hence, mitigating the negative effects of noisy clients is critical to make federated learning viable in practice.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.4" class="ltx_p">To investigate how the noisy clients affect the classiﬁcation model in standard federated learning procedure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, we conduct the following experiment. We use 10 clients to train the 9-layer convolutional neural network used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> on the CIFAR-10. We follow the i.i.d setting to partition the data into 10 clients. In addition, we set 5 clients as noisy clients whose training data are manually injected with the 50% symmetric label noise. The rest of the clients have data with clean labels. To specifically show how the noisy clients impact each layer of the global model, we measure each layer’s representations extraction ability by computing the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> similarity between the representations from the same layer of different clients’ local models.
The CKA is a representation similarity metric that is widely used to compute the feature representation learned by two neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
In our experiments, we use linear CKA to calculate the similarity of the output features between the two models.

Four layers including the model’s 1st, 4th, 7th, and last layer (classifier layer) are selected to show. Interestingly, we find that the deeper layer in the model has a lower CKA feature similarity score between noisy and clean clients. This indicates that the deeper layers represent higher heterogeneity across the noisy and clean clients in federated noisy client learning.
By averaging each layer’s CKA similarity between the global model and clean/noisy clients’ local models respectively, we obtain the approximate of each layer’s feature output similarity between the global model and noisy/clean clients’ models.
Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV A Close Look at Noisy Client ‣ Federated Noisy Client Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> represents the experiment result which shows that the noisy clients’ models have consistently lower CKA similarity score as the layer becomes deeper, compared with the global model. This lower CKA feature similarity score between the global model and noisy clients indicates that the local model from the noisy clients diverges from the global model in terms of the feature extraction ability. Although noisy clients exist, the global model’s feature extraction ability still has high consistency with clients with clean labels, reflecting a high CKA similarity score with clean clients.
Based on the above experiment study on federated noisy client learning, we can observe that compared with training on the clients with clean labels, the deeper layer’s feature extraction ability in the noisy client’s model is severely declined, reflected by the lower feature similarity among the noisy and clean clients’ deeper layers. Moreover, the deeper layer of the noisy clients’ models can be biased by their noisy label data, causing divergence from the global model.</p>

Hence, it is critical to identify noisy clients and mitigate their negative effects. There are two main technical challenges for FL with noisy clients: 1) how to identify the client with noisy data while preserving data privacy, and 2) how to conduct a robust model aggregation to effectively mitigate the impact of noisy clients. In this section, we present the design of Federated Noisy Client Learning (Fed-NCL), which effectively distinguishes noisy clients and intelligently mitigates the impact of noisy clients during the overall FL process. <a href="#S4.F5" title="In IV A Close Look at Noisy Client ‣ Federated Noisy Client Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> is an overview of Fed-NCL which mainly contains the following three stages: 1) identification of noisy clients, 2) robust layer-wise adaptation aggregation, and 3) label correction. In identifying noisy clients, the server calculates the reliability scores of the clients to find out the noisy clients statistically. After detecting the noisy clients, the server performs robust layer-wise adaptation aggregation, which jointly considers the model’s layer divergence and the impact of noisy clients, to obtain a global model for the next round of local training. Finally, we correct the label from the noisy clients to reduce the negative impact of noisy clients and gain more valuable features from the noisy clients.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Identifying noisy clients is crucial to preventing the noisy client model from damaging the global model aggregation. Existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> depend on the benchmark data, which is a set of data with completely clean labels stored on the server. The requirement of such methods is difficult to satisfy in real-world applications because the clean label data is hard to retrieve in certain application scenarios. Therefore, we propose a benchmark data-free noisy client detection approach. The key idea of our noisy client detection approach is that each participant is assigned a reliability score which is quantified based on the client’s data quality and the divergence between the client and global models. Then, the server utilizes the abnormal detection model to identify the noisy clients based on the distribution of all clients’ reliability scores.</p>

As the training proceeds, the local model of a clean client and the updated global model has a small distance. However, the distance between the noisy client’s local model and the clean client’s local model keeps at a high level. Thus, model distance is an effective metric to quantify the model quality in FL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">In deep learning, it has been empirically shown that deep networks can learn the clean pattern at the start of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Thus, the deep networks can discriminate the noisy and clean label data, reflecting the prediction with high confidence on clean label data.

We treat the identification of noisy clients from all clients’ reliability scores as an abnormal detection task. It is intuitive to set a fixed threshold or train an anomaly detection model (<span id="S5.SS1.p6.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, autoencoder) to filter out noisy clients. However, since the training process of federated learning is highly dynamic and unpredictable, these methods are difficult to guarantee the performance of anomaly detection. Therefore, we utilize anomaly detection with the normal distribution to identify noisy clients. Specifically, we approximate all clients’ reliability scores as normally distributed.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.10" class="ltx_p">It is intuitive to abandon the noisy clients’ models during global aggregation because they destroy the optimization of the global model. However, this kind of method reduces the convergence rate of the global model since the global model only learns the data from clients with clean label data, leading to a low generalization of the global model. According to the above discussion, the noisy and clean clients shows that the output feature of the former layer of the local models from noisy and clean clients has high similarity. This implies that the noisy clients’ local models can still learn the same pattern as the clean clients, and the noisy clients’ models can contribute to the global model. Therefore, we use the <math id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.9.m1.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> to increase the distance between the global model and noisy clients’ models while reducing the negative impact from noisy clients and improving the generalization of the global model. Even with noisy clients, they still can learn clean and easy patterns at the beginning of the training due to the memorization effect of the deep neural model. The problem is that the noisy clients’ local model will gradually overfit their local noisy label data and destroy the global model. To address this problem, we design an adaptive <math id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m(c)" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.2.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.1.cmml">c</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2"><times id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.2.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1.1">𝑐</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.10.m2.1c">m(c)</annotation></semantics></math> to control the penalty for noisy clients:</p>

The experimental results demonstrate that Fed-NCL outperforms the other baselines in various noise distributions. For Bernoulli distribution, the Trimmed mean and FedProx cannot address the noise clients problem as their average test accuracy drops significantly when increasing the number of noisy clients, by 24.23% for the Trimmed mean and 12.16% for the FedProx, averagely. For Fed-NCL, it only drops 2.34%. Significantly, Fed-NCL outperforms other baselines by at least 11.23% in MNIST, 19.87% in Fashion MNIST, and 29.37% in CIFAR10 in the S1 setting (60% of clients with noisy labels data). These results point out that Fed-NCL is robust to noisy clients, especially in the high ratio of noisy clients. For the truncated Gaussian distribution, the corresponding results show that Fed-NCL also can effectively mitigate the impact of noisy clients which follows a truncated Gaussian distribution, which improves the FedAvg at least by 7.96% in MNIST, 7.44% in Fashion MNIST, and 9.49% in CIFAR10.

Specifically, for the Bernoulli distribution, we can see that the global model trained by FedAvg and FedProx can not converge because their test accuracy curves are unstable at the end of training. This is because the noisy clients guide the update of the collaborative model in a divergent direction during the model aggregation process. Although the FedProx adds the extra proximal term to reduce the variance of local updates, it can not effectively mitigate the negative effect from the noisy data. The Trimmed mean performs better by removing a specific percentage of the smallest and largest parameters from the collected local models. However, Fed-NCL achieves the prominent performance advantage among all the baselines for the following reasons.
During the training process, Fed-NCL can prevent the misleading from the noisy clients’ model by correctly identifying the noisy clients from clean clients. The reliability score can effectively evaluate each client by measuring the quality of the local training data and model. Thus, correctly detecting the noisy clients is the first key success of Fed-NCL. Then, our robust layer-wise aggregation can reduce the impact of the noisy clients and guide the global model’s updates with clean clients’ model, increasing the model convergence rate. Finally, Fed-NCL dynamically performs label correction on the noisy clients, which improves the generalization ability of the global model.

Fed-NCL is effective to simultaneously tackle the client with noisy labels data and heterogeneous data, by over other methods up to 26%.
Compared with the data partition with the IID setting, all the baselines have performance degradation. On the contrary, Fed-NCL is still effective in different noise scenarios with data heterogeneity. The challenge of tackling noisy clients with data heterogeneity is that we cannot quantify the impact of the data heterogeneity and noisy clients; both of them direct the collaborative model in a divergent direction. To address this challenge, Fed-NCL first identifies the noisy clients from the clean clients by measuring the client’s data quality and model divergence, which can help the global model update with a correct direction with SGD. Then the robust layer-wise aggregation can aggregate all the clients’ models in layer-quantify to gain a more robust global model. Therefore, Fed-NCL is effective for tackling noisy clients with data heterogeneity.

Thus, it can improve the effectiveness and robustness of global training in federated noisy client learning. For the label correction, it can improve the global model performance up to 13% in serious noise settings (30% of clients have data with noisy labels). As for the noisy client’s detection, precisely measuring the reliability score of each client is the key to success in effectively detecting noisy clients. Thus, we removed two corresponding criteria in Eqs. (<a href="#S5.E7" title="Equation 7 ‣ V-A Noisy Client Detection. ‣ V Federated Noisy Client Learning ‣ Federated Noisy Client Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) and (<a href="#S5.E8" title="Equation 8 ‣ V-A Noisy Client Detection. ‣ V Federated Noisy Client Learning ‣ Federated Noisy Client Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) in reliability score, respectively. We can observe that both criteria contribute to reliability score, which improves global model’s performance 6% by on average.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed two kinds of heterogeneous noisy label scenarios in FL to precisely model the noise level distribution across the clients.
To study the impact of noisy clients on federated learning, we first investigate critical issue caused by noisy clients in FL and quantify the negative impact of the noisy clients in terms of the representations learned by different layers. We have shown that the noisy client could negatively impact the convergence, feature extraction ability, and performance of the aggregated global model in FL.
Moreover, in order to effectively conduct FL with noisy clients, we have proposed a simple yet effective learning framework, Federated Noisy Client Learning (Fed-NCL), which first identifies the noisy clients through well estimating the data quality and model divergence. Then robust layer-wise aggregation is proposed to adaptively aggregate the local models of each client to deal with the data heterogeneity caused by the noisy clients. We further perform the label correction on the noisy clients to improve the generalization of the global model.
Experimental results have shown that our Fed-NCL can effectively boost the performance of different deep networks with noisy clients in homogeneous and heterogeneous FL.
