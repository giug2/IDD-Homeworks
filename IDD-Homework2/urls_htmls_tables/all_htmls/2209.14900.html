<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics.
To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters.
The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively.
Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.
Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To create a model with high accuracy, machine learning (ML) needs a large size of high-quality training data. Due to limitations of user privacy, data security and competition among industries, usually the data is limited. Besides, the concern around data privacy is rising. Related laws and regulations are appearing, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU), so it becomes more challenging to collect sensitive data together for learning a model. Therefore, federated learning (FL) could be a solution to collaboratively train an ML model while preserving data on its local device distributedly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. FL is a special distributed learning framework, which was proposed by Google in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> was called FedAvg. In FedAvg, each device trains a model locally for a certain number of local iterations and uploads their parameters to a base station periodically to build a shared global model.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges and motivation</span>. On account of the huge number of parameters in prevalent ML models, FL has high requirements of device memory, computational capability and communication bandwidth.
The limited communication and computation resources in the real world bring several challenges to the deployment of FL: (1) Limited bandwidth results in long <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">latency</span> between clients and the server and consequently affects the convergence time of the global model. (2) A large amount of <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">energy</span> is needed because a satisfactory model requires plenty of local computation and communication rounds. (3) Due to the large size of current ML models, low-battery devices with limited computation resources have difficulties in joining an FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To improve the efficiency of FL,
it is crucial to save both communication and computation resources, which can be achieved by reducing communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or finding optimal resource (e.g., transmission power, bandwidth, CPU frequency, etc.) allocation strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This paper focuses on the latter solution.
An optimal resource allocation strategy will allow us to reduce the execution latency and energy consumption, and accelerate the convergence of the global model.
Therefore, it is essential to consider how to adjust bandwidth, transmission power and CPU clock frequency for each participating device to jointly optimize energy consumption and completion time (i.e., delay). Moreover, different scenarios have different energy and latency demands. For example, connected autonomous vehicles in a smart transportation system require low-latency control decisions, while personal computers may tolerate higher latency to utilize the idle time to train their model. Thus, it raises the following question: how to allocate the transmit power, bandwidth and CPU frequency to each user device to find the optimal trade-off between energy consumption and the total completion time of the FL system while accommodating to different scenarios?

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above question, we consider a basic FL system via frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and formulate a joint optimization of energy and delay problem over a wireless network.
The objective function includes a weighted sum of the total energy consumption and the total completion time. Given a certain weight for a specific application scenario, we can find a trade-off between energy and execution latency.
The participating devices in FL are under power and bandwidth constraints while pursuing as little energy and time consumption as possible.</p>

Yet, since both two variables can be decoupled from others, their optimal values can be easily obtained as in Theorem 2 of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> The rest variables of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are the same as ours. However, if just minimizing the total energy consumption, it will be easy to decouple the optimization problem into two subproblems as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> does. Since all subproblems in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are convex, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> can easily obtain the optimal solution.</span></p>

the optimization variables in both work include each device’s bandwidth allocation via FDMA and CPU frequency, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> also considers edge association of devices, and our paper also optimizes each device’s transmission power. Secondly, in our work, a challenge in solving the optimization arises from the coupling between the FDMA bandwidth allocation and the weighted minimization of energy and delay.
Yet, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> avoids such challenge by simplifying the Shannon formula for devices’ data rates. In particular, in Equation (5) of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the noise power as the denominator inside the logarithm of the Shannon formula is forcefully assumed as a constant that does not scale with the allocated bandwidth, while it should the noise power spectral density times the bandwidth. Such extreme simplification in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> makes the bandwidth allocation easy to solve. In this paper, we use the exact expression of the Shannon formula and hence run into a much more challenging optimization.</p>

This explains why the total energy consumption of these three lines suddenly drops at <math id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.9" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1a"><mn mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0.9</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1.1">0.9</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p11.1.1.1.m1.1c">0.9</annotation></semantics></math> km.

In addition, transmission energy takes the lead of the total energy consumption. Only optimizing the computation energy cannot exceed the performance of only optimizing the transmission energy.
Furthermore, we are able to discover the conflicting relationship between maximum completion time and total energy consumption.

By adjusting two weight parameters, the corresponding resource allocation strategy can be found. Additionally, this makes our resource allocation scheme more flexible and amenable to different requirements of the FL system. In the experiments, we can observe that our resource allocation algorithm improves the state of the art especially <span id="S8.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">when there is a tight constraint in terms of the total completion time.</span></p>
