<p id="id22.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) is the most general variation of Federated Learning. According to this distributed paradigm, a feature learning pre-step is commonly carried out by only one party, typically the server, on publicly shared data. After that, the Federated Learning phase takes place to train a classifier collaboratively using the learned feature extractor. Each involved client contributes by locally training only the classification layers on a private training set.
The peculiarity of an FTL scenario makes it hard to understand whether poisoning attacks can be developed to craft an effective backdoor. State-of-the-art attack strategies assume the possibility of shifting the model attention toward relevant features introduced by a forged trigger injected in the input data by some untrusted clients. Of course, this is not feasible in FTL, as the learned features are fixed once the server performs the pre-training step.</p>
<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, in this paper, we investigate this intriguing Federated Learning scenario to identify and exploit a vulnerability obtained by combining eXplainable AI (XAI) and dataset distillation.
In particular, the proposed attack can be carried out by one of the clients during the Federated Learning phase of FTL by identifying the optimal local for the trigger through XAI and encapsulating compressed information of the backdoor class.
Due to its behavior, we refer to our approach as a focused backdoor approach (FB-FTL for short) and test its performance by explicitly referencing an image classification scenario.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning and machine learning solutions received great attention from the research community thanks to the development of powerful technologies capable of handling and processing huge data volumes. However, the need to collect data from disparate sources to foster the training of models implies sharing raw data with a third-party computation unit, thus implying privacy concerns over the users’ data.
This condition led to the development of Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">fl-mcmahan, </a>)</cite>, according to which users train collaboratively a model without sharing any private information and, therefore, maintaining data localized. Initially, the basic definition of Federated Learning assumes that all the involved clients own private data from the same feature space (Horizontal Federated Learning, HFL for short). This assumption makes this scenario impractical in some cases. As a matter of fact, in many real-life scenarios different parties need to use data for the same samples but from different feature spaces. For example, a bank may collaborate with an invoice agency to build a financial risk model for their customers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2024vertical, </a>)</cite>. Under this assumption, the collaborative learning among such clients is called Vertical Federated Learning (VFL).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By extending the scenarios considered above, the most general case consists of parties that collaborate into a machine/deep learning process by using local data that differ in both feature and sample space; this situation is encompassed by the Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2024vertical, </a>)</cite>.
Such a paradigm received great attention from the research community and has been, for instance, employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020fedhealth, </a>)</cite>, where the authors propose a novel architecture for personalized healthcare via wearable devices. Given the type of application, we believe it is crucial to understand the vulnerabilities this paradigm introduces, which are still relatively unexplored.
For this reason, this paper focuses on understanding whether backdoor attacks can be crafted by manipulating local data on maliciously controlled parties involved in Federated Transfer Learning.
Backdoor attacks have been largely studied in recent years in both HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan2020backdoor, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020attack, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie2019dba, </a>)</cite> and VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2020backdoor, </a>)</cite>; however, to the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to target FTL and show that such a paradigm is vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
It is worth underlying that, compared to the classical FL scenarios, FTL presents unique challenges as the learning is typically broken down into two parts: a feature learning task, globally carried out by a server on a publicly shared dataset and the subsequent training of custom classification layers carried out by all the clients using private local data in a federated task.
Because the feature extractor part of the classification model is learned in a different phase with respect to the federated learning one, crafting a backdoor implies a totally different approach than those typically adopted by existing backdoor attacks for FL.
In our study, to define our strategy for a backdoor attack, we adopt the FTL scenario of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020fedhealth, </a>)</cite>, where the clients receive an initial model trained to extract features from input data by the server and then engage in a federated learning task to train only the classification layers (i.e., the first part of the model shared by the server is kept frozen). As typically done in the related literature, in our study, we chose image classification as a reference deep learning task, and the frozen part, pre-trained by the server, is the feature extractor of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, each client uses a private local dataset to collaboratively fine-tune the last layers of the model (fully connected layers) by computing local updates during each training epoch and uploading the results to the server. The server then aggregates the changes and distributes the updated global model to the clients for the subsequent learning epochs.
In this complex scenario, an adversary aiming at designing a backdoor trigger cannot leverage the possibility of forging new relevant features for the model to learn, such as a small square of noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>)</cite> or simple objects like sunglasses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2017targeted, </a>)</cite>, because the feature extractor block of the model is frozen. Therefore, any additional feature will be promptly discarded by the global model. As a result, the attacker needs a more elaborated mechanism for the trigger design that would steer the poisoned sample’s latent representation toward the target class.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We overcome this challenge by combining an Explainable AI (XAI) step on the feature extractor with a data-driven approach to build a malicious trigger and suitably position it in high-attention locations learned by the global model. For this reason, we call our strategy a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">focused</span> backdoor attack.
To do so, we leverage a powerful XAI tool, named GradCam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">selvaraju2017grad, </a>)</cite>, to find out the best way for an adversary to alter the images. Moreover, we exploit a distillation strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2020dataset, </a>)</cite> to encapsulate inside the trigger the main information characterizing the features of the target class of the backdoor. We argue that by suitably locating our trigger in attention locations for the feature extractor component of the model and encapsulating a compressed representation of the target class in it, we can deviate the behavior of the classifier when such a trigger is present in the input image.
The experiments we carried out show that FTL is still vulnerable to backdoor attacks built according to our strategy.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">An important facility of our proposal is the capability of adapting the trigger to the attacked data to minimize its impact in terms of necessary variations caused by its inclusion.
This is especially true for images where triggers typically alter visible regions to craft a backdoor.
Training data are automatically processed by local clients, and therefore, the fact that the trigger may actually be visible to some extent does not necessarily represent a blocking point for the attacker. However, minimizing its visible impact is crucial to make the attack as stealthy as possible.</p>

Finally, after the clients upload their local weights, the server updates the global model by aggregating the local weights. There are various aggregation techniques that can be used based on the given scenario. In this work, we will mostly consider averaging, but we will also test four additional aggregation strategies in an extra experiment.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In transfer learning, a model that has been trained for a specific task can be reused as a starting point for a model on a different task, significantly lowering the costs required for the development of the new model. Federated transfer learning (FTL) combines principles from Transfer Learning and Federated Learning. It consists of a central model that aggregates updates from clients or has trained a model from a publicly available dataset. This model is then distributed to the clients who use their own datasets to improve its performance on their data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020fedhealth, </a>)</cite>.

In this attack, the adversary adds a secret functionality into a model that will be activated during inference. The backdoor is activated by malicious inputs that contain a predefined property, the trigger. The backdoor’s activation allows the attacker to control the model’s behavior. For example, in autonomous driving, the backdoored model could classify a stop sign as a speed limit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>)</cite>. The backdoor can be embedded through data poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>)</cite>, code poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">blind-backdoors, </a>)</cite>, or model poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">handcrafted-backdoors-in-dnns, </a>)</cite>. To measure the attack’s effectiveness, we use the attack success rate, which represents the number of times that the backdoor is activated over the total poisoned samples fed into the network. To keep the attack stealthy, we need to ensure that the model’s performance on the designated task is not affected by the backdoor insertion.</p>

In this work, we use GradCam to identify the best position of our triggers.</p>

Without loss of generality, in our proposal and experiments, we consider an image classification task, making Convolutional Neural Networks an intuitive architectural choice. However, we argue that with minor tweaks, our approach could also work with different models.
In practice, the server carries out a global Feature Learning task that will then be shared by all the clients.

In this scenario, the positioning of the trigger plays a key role in the attack’s success.
In our attack, we propose a strategy that aims to detect and override the main features of the victim image with a dynamic trigger containing compressed features of the target class, as described in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3.

Empowered by the generated triggers, we hence assume that the attacker controls a percentage of the clients to poison the model during the Federated Transfer Learning process.</p>

This updated model will be sent back to the clients for further fine-tuning. The adversary’s end goal is, hence, to embed a backdoor that remains active after the completion of the Federated Transfer Learning.
The backdoor can then be used to control the model’s behavior through malicious inputs containing the trigger and force it to misclassify them to the target class.</p>

Our approach, shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.3. FB-FTL Attack ‣ 3. Methodology ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, does not just add a trigger in a fixed position into the image. Instead, the idea behind this attack is to override the features of the original class with the ones of the target class.
To do so, an XAI approach that highlights the important regions in a target image for the given model is needed.
In particular, for this intent, we use GradCam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">selvaraju2017grad, </a>)</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The intuition behind our approach is, hence, to override the main features of an image, allowing its correct classification with a distilled trigger.
This strategy would inevitably alter the original image and, most probably, the main visual content, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2. Performance Evaluation of FB-FTL ‣ 4. Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
This alteration can be detected using similarity metrics that compare the original image with its altered version.
To synthesize a trigger that blends better inside the image making it less noticeable to automatic detection systems or to a human eye, we can include a term, derived from a similarity metrics capable of detecting such alterations, in the distillation matching loss.</p>

We compare our solution with well-established backdoor attacks for HFL to understand if they are still effective in this configuration. In particular, we compared our solution with three static patch backdoor attacks: pixel pattern trigger, square trigger, and watermark trigger. In addition, we compared our solution against a novel approach that uses a trainable dynamic trigger: A3FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">NEURIPS2023_A3FL, </a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the main results in terms of the success rate of our approach compared to existing solutions.
With this experiment, we want to investigate the applicability of backdoor attacks to this FTL.
Since no other attack in this setup is available, we decided to compare our solution against attacks that are intended for HFL due to their similarities in terms of the configuration of the training between server and clients. In both cases, the clients train the global model on their local data while the server aggregates compared to VFL, in which the global model is split between the top model on the server and the bottom models on the clients.
In addition to traditional static triggers, we compare our approach also against a novel solution, named A3FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">NEURIPS2023_A3FL, </a>)</cite>, that injects in the image a dynamic trigger specifically generated for the target class.
Since one of FTL’s main properties is freezing the feature extractor layers, we expect that traditional backdoor attacks will be ineffective in this scenario.
The considered attacks introduce into the image the triggers with additional features that are unknown to the feature extractor network.
Considering the A3FL solution, we expect better performance than the traditional static backdoors. However, we are still unable to match the performance of our attack due to the absence of the focus logic with GradCam.</p>

Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, as expected, the existing attacks are almost unperceived by the federated model.
The A3FL approach, instead, achieves a better success rate than static triggers while still affecting the model accuracy on the main task like the traditional one.
These results also give some insights into the importance of focusing logic with GradCam.
In Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="4.5. GradCam Importance Analysis ‣ 4. Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a>, we present an in-depth analysis in this sense.
Looking at our approach FB-FTL, we can see it is effective across the considered datasets.
It is interesting to observe how our approach is capable of achieving high success rates despite the different characteristics of the datasets presented in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Datasets ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>.
Even with datasets like SVHN, where the background contains information about other classes, our attack distills a trigger that preserves the importance of the original features compared to the ones in the background.
Considering GTSRB, instead, since contains images of traffic signs, the samples shares many features and in this case, our attack distills into the trigger the right ones selecting the features belonging just to the target class.
We can see also how our approach is the best at being effective and, at the same time, only slightly affects the performance of the model on the main task.
This is because the feature extractor part of the model will recognize only the known features, so with traditional backdoor attacks, the network will still focus just on the information of the original class, discarding the trigger. Basically, the attacker is training the model, assigning to these images the target class, drifting the accuracy of the model on those features, affecting the final accuracy.
In our case, instead, we are substituting the original features with information from the target class distilled from the network itself. In this way, the network will recognize the new features as known, only slightly affecting the accuracy of the main model.</p>

On the other hand, this approach also owes its success to the overriding of the main features of the image using GradCam to position the trigger.
This makes inevitable, in most of the images, an alteration of the main subject of the image.

As we can see, with three out of four datasets, we can confirm our intuitions.
Indeed, the success rate of the attack is comparable across the different scenarios with negligible fluctuations.
The only dataset that benefits from a high percentage of attackers is GTSRB.

If we look, instead, at the worst scenario, the accuracy of the attack is a little lower than the baseline but still with a not negligible success rate of around <math id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="60\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">60</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">60</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1c">60\%</annotation></semantics></math>.
This is expected due to the similarities between classes of the dataset requiring for the attacker to contribute to the training of the federated model with the backdoored images to make the attack more effective.</p>

In this sense, we conducted a second experiment varying the number of clients included in the federated process.
In particular, we want to verify how our attack varies, considering just one malicious client but changing, in this case, the number of clients.
In the first scenario, we considered half of the clients compared to the baseline, <math id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="5" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">5</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1.1">5</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.2.m2.1c">5</annotation></semantics></math> clients in total, and the second scenario includes ten times more clients, specifically <math id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="100" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">100</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1.1">100</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.3.m3.1c">100</annotation></semantics></math>.
Since our attack relies on the characteristic that the feature extractor in the considered Federated Transfer Learning scenario is frozen, we expect that our attack is just partially dependent on the total number of clients in the Federated Learning process.</p>

In this situation, because there is a bigger region to distill, our attack has more space to include more refined features about the target class.
Since dataset distillation works by providing the network examples of the target class, having a bigger region to distill makes our trigger prone to overfit too much on example images.
In this way, the trigger will include information specific to those particular images in addition to the more general features of the class.
This additional information breaks our assumption of distilling triggers with only general features of the target category, making them less relevant and affecting the attack’s performance.</p>

As we can see from the heatmaps produced by Gradcam on the original image and the same with the addition of the trigger, the model to classify the image focuses on the same region.
This shows how our trigger successfully substitutes the main features of the original class as the most important portion of the image for the model to classify it.
Another interesting result we can observe is the area of importance detected by the GradCam algorithm.
The different shades of colors presented in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.5. GradCam Importance Analysis ‣ 4. Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> represent the importance of those features for the classification of the image.
The regions with the tones red and yellow are actually the ones that matter the most for the model to perform the classification.
Looking at the examples in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.5. GradCam Importance Analysis ‣ 4. Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we can see how the produced heatmaps on the original images highlight, of course, the most important region in red but also show how the model looks at regions around in yellow to take a decision for the classification of the image.
The results produced on the backdoored images, instead, show an important region that is much more concentrated around the trigger.
This proves that the combination of the distilled trigger and explainability can confidently drive the target model toward the target class with more confidence compared to the original class.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To better prove our intuition, we performed an ablation study to test the different components of our approach.
In particular, we tested the components of our solution in three different configurations.
In the first scenario, the trigger is distilled in a fixed position like traditional dynamic solutions.
In the second case, the trigger is still distilled in fixed coordinates, but, differently from the previous scenario, we use GradCam to detect the most important features of the images, and we override them with random noise.
The final scenario, instead, is our full solution.</p>

As expected, the dynamic trigger in a fixed position is not capable of producing an effective backdoor attack, confirming what we have already reported in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2. Performance Evaluation of FB-FTL ‣ 4. Experimental Results ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.
An interesting result can be seen in the scenario in which we obfuscate the features of the original class.
As we can see, the success rate of the attack in this scenario improves compared to the one in which we just distill the trigger in a fixed position of the image.
Especially for the SVHN dataset, we can see how the performance of the attack improves three times more after masking the original information of the images.
This result proves how covering the main features of the images and moving the distilled trigger in the right position contribute to deceiving the frozen feature extractor of the transfer model.</p>

This can be related to the nature of these datasets, as described in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Datasets ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>.
In particular, SVHN is characterized by images with backgrounds that can contain features from classes different from the principal one. Adding a trigger too different from the overall image could make the model focus more on the background containing features belonging to categories different from our target class.
A more blended trigger, in this case, allows us to improve even more the performance of our attack.</p>

The colors of the pixels of the triggers better match the palette and the intensity of the colors of the original image compared to the basic implementation of the dynamic triggers.
Looking at the last column, the initialization of the trigger plays an important part.
As we can see, the generated trigger blends better with the main subject of the image, preserving some of the original pixels that do not need to be updated and resulting in an almost transparent trigger.
The contribution of the initialization strategy is to make the trigger even less noticeable to the human eye compared to other backdoor attacks in which the trigger is easily detectable by a human check.</p>

The results on these are presented in Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1. Horizontal Federated Learning Defenses ‣ 5. Defenses Evaluation ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>.</p>

This is done by clustering the clients using HDBSCAN over the pairwise cosine similarity distances among the updates and keeping only the cluster that includes at least 50% clients.
The second component applies an adaptive differential privacy approach estimating the clipping bound and level of noise, in a way that neutralizes the attack and preserves the original performance of the model.</p>

Overall, as expected, our attack can pass the filtering of the defenses, preserving the same performance in most cases. This is due to the fact that our triggers are distilled to include the most general features of the target class and override the one of the original class.

As we can see, with all the datasets, our approach archives results in terms of success rate even better compared to the baseline without the defense.
FoolsGold, by design, gives more importance to the features that are beneficial for the accuracy of the final model.
As a result, it will preserve the updates that are closer to the mean of the distribution, penalizing the outliers.
By definition, our approach aims to distill into the trigger the most general features of the target class, resulting in updates that, on purpose, want to deviate as little as possible from the mean of the benign updates.
To conclude, we demonstrate that defenses intended for Horizontal Federated Learning are effective only in particular cases with datasets with specific characteristics. Moreover, in some situations, they can be beneficial for our attack.</p>

Label smoothing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">szegedy2016rethinking, </a>)</cite> approaches redistribute the probability of the main class across other secondary classes to instill in the model the knowledge about similarities between classes, making it more robust.
Knowledge Distillation is the perfect candidate to generate a smooth version of the labels.

The tuning of these parameters is important to select the maximum power level without affecting the accuracy of the model.
With this strategy, the features will be learned by the network as less separated between the classes compared to using one-hot encoded labels.
We expect that this additional layer of uncertainty can affect the performance of our attack.</p>

Defenses Evaluation ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, we present the results of our attack against the KDk defense.
Our attack is capable of preserving most of its performance on three of the selected datasets, but at the same time, all of them, even if slightly, are affected by the defense compared to the one for the Horizontal scenario.
What makes our attack resilient is the distillation logic behind the generation of the trigger.
Our strategy tries to distill images by providing examples instead of backpropagating to the information of the target class using just the cross-entropy loss. This makes our solution more robust even if the transfer model has been trained with a level of uncertainty on the separation between the features of the classes.
Similar to what happened with GTSRB against HFL defenses, also in this case, one of the datasets, SVHN, is affected the most by the defense due to its characteristics.
As we said in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Datasets ‣ Let’s Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>, the images of this dataset are characterized by backgrounds that contain information about other classes compared in addition to the principal one.
Using the distilled soft labels, the KDk defense is training the model to give more importance to the elements in the background mitigating our strategy of overriding the features on the main class.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning was proposed by researchers in Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">fl-mcmahan, </a>)</cite>. This work introduced the HFL paradigm, where all the clients use data from the same feature space but may not be of the same sample identity. In VFL, the clients own data that belong to the same samples but do not share the same feature space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020review, </a>)</cite>. FTL is applied to scenarios in which the clients’ datasets are different both in the feature space and the samples identities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">yang2019federated, </a>)</cite>.
Given that such scenarios are more general, they are more practical and applicable to real-world applications.
For example, FedHealth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020fedhealth, </a>)</cite> uses FTL to support personalized healthcare through wearable devices. To this end, first, the users’ devices collaborate to train a shared model in the cloud for human activity recognition with privacy guarantees, and then each participant uses FTL to personalize the model and improve its performance based on the local dataset.
For the personalization, the authors assumed that in each client, the first part of the downloaded model is frozen, and only the fully connected layers are fine-tuned with the private dataset. We adopted this model in our experiments as the frozen feature extractor that each client has makes traditional backdoor attacks more challenging. The adversary cannot use triggers that are small features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>)</cite> and are based on the model’s feature extractor, as they can affect only the last layers of the model. As a result, more elaborate strategies need to be designed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Backdoor attacks in deep learning were first introduced by Gu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets, </a>)</cite>. In this attack, an adversary alters some training samples to insert a secret functionality into the trained model that is activated during inference. This attack has become very popular and has also been applied to Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan2020backdoor, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020attack, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie2019dba, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2022more, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">arazzi2023turning, </a>)</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan2020backdoor, </a>)</cite>, a model replacement attack was introduced where the adversary attempts to replace the global model with a malicious one that contains a backdoor by amplifying the gradient updates of the adversaries. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020attack, </a>)</cite>, the authors established a theoretical framework to verify that a model is vulnerable to backdoor attacks if it is also vulnerable against evasion attacks in FL.
Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie2019dba, </a>)</cite> split the trigger among multiple malicious clients, making the first distributed backdoor attack in the Federated Learning setup. The backdoor can be activated with both the local triggers but also with the global trigger, which is a combination of all the local triggers. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2022more, </a>)</cite> used this technique to backdoor federated graph neural networks. All these attacks, however, have been applied to HFL, where the adversary has full control of the training of the local model so every layer can be affected. In this work, the adversary cannot alter the feature extractor of the model, making the trigger generation more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore backdoor attacks in this scenario.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7. </span>Conclusions and Future Work</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first focused backdoor attack specifically designed for the Federated Transfer Learning Scenario.
Our attack, called FB-FTL, aims to overcome the challenges imposed by the scenario.
In this context, a feature learning step is carried out by the server before the actual federated learning, which then aims at collaboratively train only the classification layers by keeping frozen the feature extractor ones.
Due to this characteristic, existing backdoor attacks, especially the static ones that introduce unknown features to the feature extractor, are ineffective in this scenario.
Moreover, traditionally, backdoor attacks introduce a trigger in the original data without applying any strategy to minimize its impact on them. For instance, in the case of image data, the position of the trigger may strongly influence the visualization outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To design our attack, we started by analyzing the FTL framework to understand its vulnerabilities and to exploit them.
The main intuition behind our approach is to maximize the success of our attack by identifying the optimal spot in the input data to position the trigger.
To do this, we leverage an XAI strategy to identify the most important regions of the images for their classification. The use of explainability to locate the trigger over features detectable by the feature extractor component of the FTL model brought to the definition of the first focused backdoor attack.
Another important aspect of our attack is related to the way in which the trigger is generated.
For this purpose, we borrowed some ideas from the dataset distillation field. In particular, the attack distills the main features of the target class into the trigger.
Combined with the focusing strategy, it overrides the information of the original class with the desired one.
In our experimental campaign, we analyzed the different components of our approach, showing the importance of distilling the target class features and correctly positioning the trigger in the input data.
We demonstrated how our approach does not depend on the percentage of malicious clients in the process and is not heavily affected by the total number of clients.
Since no ad-hoc defenses are available for the considered scenario, we evaluated our attack against Horizontal and Vertical Federated Learning countermeasures.
As we discovered, no defense is completely effective in mitigating our approach for all the datasets.
In this sense, the most promising approach comes from the Vertical Federated family, named KDk, and makes use of Lable Differential Privacy (LabelDP) to add uncertainty between the classes in the pre-trained model.
In this direction, as future work, further exploration can be conducted to define a more effective countermeasure, still based on LabelDP, against our attack.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To conduct the experimental campaign, we selected four of the most common benchmark datasets: CIFAR10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">krizhevsky2009learning, </a>)</cite>, CINIC10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">darlow2018cinic, </a>)</cite>, SVHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">netzer2011reading, </a>)</cite>, and GTSRB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">Stallkamp2012, </a>)</cite>.
The first two are datasets that include classes of different animals or objects. Both share the same categories. The main difference is that CINIC10 is 4.5 times larger the size of CIFAR10. This difference in size allows us to prove that our approach is still effective even with larger datasets, proving our intuition that the trigger is distilled, preserving the most general and meaningful features of the target class.
The SVHN dataset, instead, contains images of houses’ civic numbers with categories from 0 to 9. One of the main characteristics of this dataset is the presence of additional numbers in the background that do not belong to the assigned category. We selected this dataset to see if the features distilled in our trigger are strong enough to be preferred to the other number in the image by the model.
The last dataset, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), contains forty-three different categories of traffic signs. Since the traffic signs have many features in common between the categories (e.g., shape and color), we included this dataset to test whether our approach is capable of overriding the right features to control the model and predict the target class.
