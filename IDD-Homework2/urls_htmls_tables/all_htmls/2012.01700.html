<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a paradigm that enables local devices to jointly train a server model while keeping the data decentralized and private.
In federated learning, since local data are collected by clients, it is hardly guaranteed that the data are correctly annotated.
Although a lot of studies have been conducted to train the networks robust to these noisy data in a centralized setting, these algorithms still suffer from noisy labels in federated learning.
Compared to the centralized setting, clients’ data can have different noise distributions due to variations in their labeling systems or background knowledge of users.
As a result, local models form inconsistent decision boundaries and their weights severely diverge from each other, which are serious problems in federated learning.
To solve these problems, we introduce a novel federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to maintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids.
These centroids are central features of local data on each device, which are aligned by the server every communication round.
Updating local models with the aligned centroids helps to form consistent decision boundaries among local models, although the noise distributions in clients’ data are different from each other.
To improve local model performance, we introduce a novel approach to select confident samples that are used for updating the model with given labels. Furthermore, we propose a global-guided pseudo-labeling method to update labels of unconfident samples by exploiting the global model.
Our experimental results on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset and the Clothing1M dataset show that our approach is noticeably effective in federated learning with noisy labels.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modern edge devices such as smart phones have been able to access an abundant amount of data, which is suitable for training deep learning models. Since each client device should transmit its local data to the central server for conventional centralized learning, it can lead to serious data privacy issues. To address these problems, federated learning has been actively studied to shift a learning environment from the central server to each edge device. In detail, federated learning allows a server model to be trained on each client’s private data without transmitting raw data to the server.</p>

For federated learning with noisy labels, we distribute noisy data to clients in an i.i.d. fashion.

Best viewed in color.</figcaption>

<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The federated learning paradigm consists of two stages: 1) In the beginning of each round, a server broadcasts the server model to selected clients, and these clients train models on their own data for multiple iterations. 2) After the clients train their models, the server aggregates the clients’ model parameters. The above process iterates until the global model converges.
In FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, model parameters of clients are aggregated in an element-wise manner with coefficients, which are proportional to the local dataset size. The global model effectively converges by FedAvg, especially when the local dataset follows an i.i.d. distribution.
Many studies have been conducted to apply it to practical applications, <span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, dealing with non-i.i.d. data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Shoham et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite>, noisy communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ang et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Peng et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, fair resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite>, and continual learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yoon et al. <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the above studies try to solve practical application issues related to preserving privacy, there are still remaining problems when local devices are used for training neural networks.
In practice, all local data should be annotated by alternative labeling techniques such as exploiting machine-generated labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kuznetsova et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> due to privacy issues.
These labels are inevitably corrupted unless the labeling techniques of all clients are accurate.
Similarly, in the centralized setting, robust learning with noisy labels has attracted attention due to its applicability for realistic situations, and various algorithms have been proposed to train models accurately in the presence of noise. Recent algorithms have tried to minimize the effect of the noisy labels by sampling reliable data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Wei et al. <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Huang et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, updating labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tanaka et al. <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Yi and Wu <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, or estimating labels from matched prototypes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han, Luo, and Wang <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Lee et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. These approaches have evolved into training the model with noisy labels successfully.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned approaches for dealing with noisy labels suffer from performance degradation in the federated setting, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Robust Federated Learning with Noisy Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Unlike centralized learning, noise distributions in clients’ data can be different from each other due to the discrepancy between their labeling systems or background knowledge.
As a result, local models form inconsistent decision boundaries and their weights severely diverge from each other, <span id="Sx1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> weight divergence.
This causes aggregation difficulties of local models, which are a serious problem in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Chen, Bhardwaj, and Marculescu <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Lim et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in federated learning with noisy labels, different noise distributions in clients should be considered, and the learning directions of clients’ models should be kept similar.
To treat these difficulties, we introduce a new federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to maintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids, as described in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Introduction ‣ Robust Federated Learning with Noisy Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
In detail, we store local class-wise centroids on each device, which are central features of local data, and upload them on the server in every round. The server aggregates them into global centroids and broadcasts these centroids to clients. The centroids are used to update local models to maintain consistent decision boundaries with other clients, although the noise distributions in clients’ data are different from each other.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In local updates, we compute local centroids based on samples with relatively small-losses to reduce the effect of noisy data, motivated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
We adjust these centroids based on the similarity with global centroids to prevent them from being corrupted by representations of noisy data.
Based on the centroids, we select confident samples to prohibit the model from fitting to noisy labels.
We also utilize a global model for unconfident samples to correct the given labels, which alleviate overfitting to noisy samples in each local model.

<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has drawn striking attention in recent years because of the increasing number of edge devices and local data collected by them. Federated learning aims to fully utilize the information of each local data without causing any serious data privacy and communication issues by transmitting the local network’s parameters instead of local raw data. For preventing the server from those issues, there are several restrictions on federated learning, and they raise various problems: 1) statistical challenges (non-i.i.d. data), 2) lower network bandwidth, 3) inconsistent accuracy across devices, and 4) noisy communication. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and research about the convergence of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite> focus on the algorithms that converge the model in non-i.i.d. data. For the limitation of network bandwidth, DGC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, signSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bernstein et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, and STC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sattler et al. <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> only transmit important gradient changes. To maintain uniform accuracy of clients, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> propose fair resource allocation. For noisy communication, Ang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ang et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> aim to cope with the disturbance of noisy communication.

Noise cleaning-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Huang et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Lyu and Tsang <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wei et al. <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> aim to detect noisy samples and train with clean samples.

In the noisy federated setting case, clients have data with various noise distributions, and this can result in inconsistent decision boundaries and severe weight divergence in local models. To tackle these problems, we let the server cooperate with the clients to maintain consistent decision boundaries via class-wise centroids.
By exploiting the centroids, we ensure that all local models have similar feature representations of classes. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for selecting confident samples and a self-training scheme suitable for the federated setting.</p>

In the noisy federated learning scenario, local datasets inevitably contain noise samples, where some of the given labels are not accurate, and noise distributions in clients’ data are different from each other. The models can overfit to noisy data and suffer from weight divergence leading to aggregation difficulties in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Lim et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel, each client loads global centroids from the server and updates its model to have similar features with the global centroids.
To achieve this, we calculate local centroids on each local model depending on the similarity with global centroids, and we explicitly constrain local features to map local centroids.
Note that the server and all of the clients store centroids in their own devices and transmit them in each communication round.
There is an additional communication burden required for class-wise centroids, but the amount is much smaller than model parameters (0.01% to 0.03% in our experiments).

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Note that we should not fully trust given labels because they may not be annotated accurately. Also they should not depend on feature similarity-based labels inducing the wrong labels for the hard samples.
The complementary use of feature similarity-based and ground truth labels can help to find accurate confident samples. Therefore, we consider the similarity-based labels with local centroids and the ground truth labels at the same time.
By adopting the ground truth label and the similarity-based label together, <math id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m_{k}^{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">m</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">k</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1c">m_{k}^{i}</annotation></semantics></math> for masking a confident sample is obtained as follows:</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To fully utilize the local data information, we exploit the well-known label correction method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tanaka et al. <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
Although this self-learning strategy with pseudo-labeling is powerful for label correction in the centralized setting, it leads local models to be self-biased <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Arazo et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Therefore, we propose global-guided pseudo-labeling, which corrects labels of local data by employing the server model.
Our technique for the label estimation prevents local models from being self-biased. Each client receives the global model at the broadcast time and uses the model to generate global-guided pseudo-labels <math id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bf\hat{y}}_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝐲</mi><mo id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">^</mo></mover><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1">^</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝐲</ci></apply><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1c">{\bf\hat{y}}_{k}</annotation></semantics></math> as follows:</p>

We exploit FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> for weight aggregation, which is well known as an effective algorithm for i.i.d. data.
For centroid aggregation, the server updates global centroids by a similarity-based aggregation of uploaded local centroids.
This leads the server model to explicitly deal with the different noise ratios in clients. Moreover, since it performs a class-wise summation of local centroids, it is less affected by different noise ratios in classes.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Co-teaching selects a fixed number of loss-based samples, which is vulnerable to different noise distributions in clients. It causes serious performance degradation of the server model since each client model is affected by noisy data.
Joint Optimization follows a self-training scheme, which is a naive pseudo-labeling method. In federated learning, this self-training method may lead the network to be self-biased due to a large number of local epochs, and the weights of self-biased local models can be diverged severely.
Notably in extremely noisy cases, clients cannot be trained properly due to high noise ratios, and when these local parameters are aggregated in the server, performance is further deteriorated.
Our proposed method is also dependent on a loss-based algorithm but robust to different noise distributions in clients because of the similarity-based centroids update. Moreover, we exploit a global-guided pseudo-labeling method, which mitigates self-bias of each client, and we validate the effectiveness of this algorithm in ablation studies.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx3.SSS0.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, neither of the two previous methods can guarantee that all local models are trained to form similar decision boundaries, which makes aggregation of local models unsuccessful.
Our proposed method constrains class representations of all client models not to diverge from global class representations.
This induces all local models to be trained to have similar boundaries, and we demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in noisy federated learning.</p>

In the case of Deep self-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han, Luo, and Wang <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, which corrects the labels of the data comparing the similarity with the several prototypes of the features, it achieves great performance improvement in the centralized setting. However, in the federated setting, this algorithm suffers from the significant performance degradation since it does not constrain local models from having similar decision boundaries.
We get the centroids with relatively small-losses and update them to be similar with global centroids. It can keep centroids less corrupted by noise data as well as achieve local decision boundaries similar to others.
Our algorithm is effective for the real-world noisy label dataset corrupted by unknown structure noise.</p>

The network trained only with the selected samples by removing unconfident samples has better performance than the one trained with all samples, and the performance increases considerably when the unconfident samples’ labels are replaced by pseudo-labels.
Moreover, we show the precision and recall of noisy label detection of our sampling approach in Table <a href="#Sx4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Clothing1M. ‣ Analysis ‣ Experiments ‣ Robust Federated Learning with Noisy Labels" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
The precision means the number of correctly detected noisy labels over the entire number of detected noisy labels and the recall means the number of correctly detected noisy labels over the entire number of noisy labels in data.
Our sampling approach selects confident samples by the complementary use of feature similarity-based and ground truth labels. It leads to high accuracy for the precision of noise labels.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have considered that each local dataset may consist of noisy labels in the practical federated learning scenario. Our proposed approach is to interchange additional information, which is global and local feature centroids of classes. We demonstrate that our approach is clearly effective in the noisy federated setting by reducing weight divergence.
Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for local updates including similarity-based confident example sampling and global-guided pseudo-labeling. In extensive experiments, we have shown that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and Clothing1M.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Ethics statement</h2>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study suggests a practical learning scenario, especially learning with noisy labels.
Based on our proposed federated learning with noisy labels, contributors in various fields such as healthcare, fairness, and recommendation system can indirectly benefit from our global guided update scheme.
In the case of healthcare, medical data with wrong annotations can be a potential threat to the smart healthcare system.
Our scheme can help prevent a medical accident due to erroneous data from occurring in federated learning, and it would play a crucial role in the development of smart healthcare.
Our approach promotes social trends shifting a learning environment from the central server to various edge devices by allowing the models to learn without precise data.
It enables client-side learning without precise data, which does not require an expert for annotating specialized data for each device.
In our setting, we only focus on dealing with noisy labels on i.i.d. data. More work is needed for noisy labels in federated learning with non-i.i.d. data.</p>
