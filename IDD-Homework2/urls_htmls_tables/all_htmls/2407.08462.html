<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) can protect the privacy of the vehicles in vehicle edge computing (VEC) to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of vehicles’ local models instead of local data. The gradients of vehicles’ local models are usually large for the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI) applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large per-round latency. Gradient quantization has been proposed as one effective approach to reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to transmit gradients. The selection of quantization level and thresholds determines the quantization error, which further affects the model accuracy and training time. To do so, the total training time and quantization error (QE) become two key metrics for the FL enabled VEC. It is critical to jointly optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. However, the time-varying channel condition causes more challenges to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization level allocation scheme to optimize the long-term reward in terms of the total training time and QE. Extensive simulations identify the optimal weighted factors between the total training time and QE, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, a large amount of data are generated by various sensors on vehicles, such as cameras, radar, lidar, as well as proximity and temperature sensors<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. For example, a self-driving car is expected to generate about 1 GB of data per second<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Vehicles need powerful computing capability to process and analyze the data to support the modeling training of the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented reality (AR) navigation, object tracking, and high-definition (HD) map generation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the computing capability of vehicles is limited. In this situation, vehicle edge computing (VEC) becomes a promising technology to facilitate these applications, where a base station (BS) connected with an edge server can collect and utilize the vehicles’ data for model training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, the raw data generated by a vehicle often contains personal information, thus there may be a risk of data leakage in data privacy in VEC<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning (FL) has been enabled in VEC<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. FL can protect the privacy of vehicles to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of vehicles’ local models instead of local data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. FL training process consists of multiple rounds. For each round, vehicles individually train their local models using local data, then the BS collects the gradients of local models and aggregates them to obtain a global model, after that the edge server sends the global model to vehicles for the next round training. After meeting the convergence requirement, i.e., reaching the desired precision or the predefined loss value, the entire training process is completed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The gradients of vehicles’ local models are usually large for the vehicular AI applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large per-round latency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Gradient quantization may reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to transmit gradients. In gradient quantization, how to determine the quantization level is a key issue<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. On one hand, a few quantization level may significantly reduce the transmission overhead, thus cause a low per-round latency and further result in a small total training time. On the other hand, lower number of quantization levels may produce bigger quantization error (QE) due to the heavily compression, which may increase the number of rounds required for convergence and increase the total training time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. That means there exists a reasonable gradient quantization level which can adjust the trade off between the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. If only the total training time is optimized, it may lead to the excessive pursuit of large quantization error and the sacrifice of model performance in order to reduce the number of communication rounds, and it is difficult to guarantee the convergence quality and accuracy of the model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is critical to jointly optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. To best of our knowledge, there is no work presented, which motivates us to conduct this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL enabled VEC, the channel condition is time-varying due to the time-varying path loss caused by the mobility of the vehicle, which causes challenges to conduct this work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a favorable framework to solve such problem in complex environments<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. There are existing papers adopting the centralized DRL framework to dynamically adjust the quantization level in wireless networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, the centralized DRL framework lead to significantly high traffic load. In addition, for the centralized DRL framework, the high mobility of vehicles makes the BS difficult to collect accurate instantaneous channel state information (CSI)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. On the contrary, in the distributed DRL framework, each vehicle makes decisions independently and does not need to send all the information to the central node, which can reduce the communication overhead and can reduce the network traffic blocking to the BS at the same time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Since each vehicle makes decisions based on its own state, distributed DRL can better collect the CSI<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Based on the above analysis, it is necessary to find a proper distributed DRL framework to allocate the quantization levels in the FL enabled VEC.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The optimization problem <span id="S5.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> is challenging to solve using conventional methods because it is a non-linear constrained integer optimization problem<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. Although some techniques, such as the branch and bound method, can provide approximate solutions, their computational complexities are very high<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the conventional optimization methods are based on the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) is known. However, it is impractical to obtain all CSI information in the real environment<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. To address these challenges, DRL can be employed to handle imperfect information. By interacting with dynamic channel environments, DRL can train a model by learning from online user behavior and environmental conditions, and thus maximizes the system utility<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>. This makes DRL a promising solution for tackling these problems. Since the centralized DRL framework results in significantly high traffic load, and the high mobility of vehicles makes it difficult for the BS to collect accurate CSI. In the next section, we will propose a distributed DRL scheme to solve the optimization problem <span id="S5.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span>.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this section, the optimal weight factors between the total training time and QE are figured out through simulation comparisons. On the basis of the optimal weight factors, we conduct simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DDQN-based quantization level allocation algorithm in the training phase and testing phase. All simulations are based on hardware environment (Intel Core i7 CPU) and software environment (Python 3.8.6). We consider the VEC network proposed in Section III, including a BS and several vehicles. Each participating vehicle is treated as an agent and participates in the DDQN-based quantization level allocation algorithm.

This is because the vehicles are farther from the base station initially, resulting in poor channel conditions and larger transmission delays. However, the vehicles tend to select higher quantization levels under these weight settings to reduce quantization error. As the channel conditions improve later on, the impact of quantization error becomes significant, and focusing relatively more on quantization error can lead to a lower train loss value.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 5-(a) and (b) show the training loss and test accuracy of FL under five different quantization schemes, respectively. Fig. 5-(a) shows the training loss comparison for different schemes. We can see that "DQN-GradQ" outperforms all baseline schemes in FL convergence rate. This is because in the early stage of the training, the vehicles are driving far away from the BS, thus the channel conditions are not good owing to the large distances between the vehicles and BS, which incurs the large transmission delay. As the vehicles driving towards the BS, the channel conditions are improve, thus transmission delay of the vehicles are reduced. In this case, the vehicles can gradually increase the quantization level thus reducing the quantization error and converging to the target loss value with less communication rounds. Moreover, we can see that the "Ada-GradQ" approach can get less the number of communication rounds in the early stage of training, but the training loss value is higher than that of "DQN-GradQ". This is because the predefined heuristic algorithm in "Ada-GradQ" cannot make good decisions in the later training phase to guarantee the accuracy of the gradient. In addition, we can see that the training loss of "Fix (2-bit)" decreases very quickly in the early stage, but it converges to a high value. This is because its lower quantization level will produce a larger quantization error. On the other hand, the training curves for "Fix (6bit)" and "Fix (10bit)" steadily decrease throughout the training rounds, however, they need more rounds to converge. This is because they use more bits to quantize the gradient during training and waste a lot of transmission overhead during training, which slows down the convergence speed.
Fig. 5-(b) shows the test accuracy of FL of different schemes. It can be seen that the accuracy of "DQN-GradQ" is higher than that of all baseline schemes under the same training rounds, indicating the lower loss leads to higher performances. Hence, the experimental results show the effectiveness of gradient quantization using DDQN.</p>

<div id="S7.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 6 shows the average total training time, average quantization error, and long-term discounted reward of the FL training process under different schemes when the number of the participating vehicle is 8. Fig. 6-(a) shows that our scheme "DQN-GradQ" has the lowest average total training time compared to all the baseline schemes. This is because, the proposed scheme can adaptively adjust the quantization level according to the channel conditions, reduce the number of rounds required for convergence, and then reduce the total training time. Fig. 6-(b) shows that the average quantization error of our scheme is lower than that of "Ada-GradQ" and "Fix (6-bit)" and higher than that of "Fix (10-bit)". This is because the proposed scheme can increase the quantization level and reduce the quantization error according to the improvement of channel conditions. However, Fig. 5-(a) shows that "Fix (10-bit)" cannot converge to a lower loss. Therefore, our scheme can minimize the average total training time of FL while ensuring the convergence of FL compared to all baseline schemes. Fig. 6-(c) compares the long-term discount rewards under different gradient quantization schemes. As can be seen, the long-term discount bonus of "DQN-GradQ" is always higher than that of other schemes. This is because "DQN-GradQ" can adaptively adjust quantization level allocation according to environmental changes to maximize long-term discount rewards.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 7 shows the total training time, quantization error, and long-term discount reward for the four schemes with different numbers of selected vehicles, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 7-(a) that the total FL training time of the four schemes gradually decreases with the increase of the number of participating vehicles. Our scheme "DQN-GradQ" is with the considerable lower FL total training time, because more participating vehicles lead to less rounds for convergence, and our scheme dynamically adjusts the allocation of quantization levels according to the change of the environment, hence, the number of communication rounds required for FL convergence is further reduced. It can be seen from Fig. 7-(b) that for the four schemes, the quantization error of different numbers of participating vehicles remains stationary, and our scheme has a relatively low quantization error. This is because the magnitude of the quantization error depends only on the size of the assigned quantization level. That is, the larger the quantization level, the smaller the quantization error, and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 7-(c), with the increase of the number of participating vehicles, the long-term discount rewards of the four schemes gradually increase, and our scheme DQN-GradQ has the largest long-term discount reward. This is because when the number of participating vehicles is larger, the rounds required for convergence is smaller, and the total training time is smaller. The proposed scheme can reasonably allocate the quantization level according to the change of channel conditions to further reduce the training time, which reflects the effectiveness of our scheme in minimizing the training time of FL.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the optimization of the training time and quantization error of FL with gradient quantization in VEC. First, we proposed a mobility and model-aware vehicle selection rule to select vehicles at the beginning of each round. After determining the participating vehicles, we considered the uncertainty of channel conditions caused by vehicle mobility in VEC, and proposed a distributed quantization level allocation scheme based on DDQN to jointly optimize the training time and quantization error of FL. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed DDQN-based gradient quantization scheme outperforms all benchmark schemes in terms of FL training time, and can minimize the training time while ensuring the FL convergence.</p>
