<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">One of the most challenging aspects of medical image analysis is the lack of a high quantity of annotated data. This makes it difficult for deep learning algorithms to perform well due to a lack of variations in the input space. While generative adversarial networks have shown promise in the field of synthetic data generation, but without a carefully designed prior the generation procedure can not be performed well. In the proposed approach we have demonstrated the use of automatically generated segmentation masks as learnable class-specific priors to guide a conditional GAN for the generation of patho-realistic samples for cytology image. We have observed that augmentation of data using the proposed pipeline called “SynCGAN” improves the performance of state of the art classifiers such as ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, Inception-V3 significantly.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The modern machine learning algorithms such as deep learning, have been greatly dependent on the availability of a large amount of high-quality data. But for various niche domains such as medical imaging large quantities of data are generally unavailable due to various constraints, such as lack of patients, infrastructural inadequacy, noisy environments, lack of experts for annotations and so on. However, with the advent of <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>enerative <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a</span>dversarial <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">n</span>etworks(GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, an avenue for high quality data generation has opened. In its base form, GANs are capable of generating samples from a randomly sampled prior which demonstrates likeliness to a predefined data distribution. However, without proper guidance, the generation process can result in eccentric outputs. However, <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">c</span>onditional GANs (CGANs)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, on the other hand, use a semantically sensible prior for guiding the data generation process to generate more accurate and meaningful samples. In the proposed work, we explore the ability of CGANs to work with learnable priors for efficient data generation to improve classifier performance on cytology images. In most practical cases the number of available data samples is too limited for deep learning approaches to thrive. Thus data augmentation serves as a primary tool for improving learning ability. Though annotating pixel specific masks for cytology images is a difficult and expensive job, however, with adequate expertise and a decent amount of labor it is possible to annotate at least a small batch of samples for a better semantic representation. The proposed approach makes use of such semantic masks to serve as a prior for CGANs. While generating fully detailed cytology images without priors is much difficult, the generation of segmentation masks from scratch is a much simpler task given that the output distribution is binomial. Our proposed approach makes use of this factor to create learnable segmentation masks that can guide CGANs for synthetic data generation. Some relevant studies are discussed in the next section. The proposed methodology is provided in the subsequent section followed by experimental setups, results, and discussions in section 4 and future scopes are discussed in the conclusion thereafter.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most common methods for data augmentation involved affine transformations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ghosh2019reshaping</span>]</cite> such as translation, rotation, scaling, shear, flipping and so on. Also, it has been noticed that training with added noise results in a much more robust classifier. The introduction of <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>enerative <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a</span>dversarial <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">n</span>etworks (GANs) has brought a shift in the paradigm of generative processes in computer vision. Several approaches have made use of GANs for data augmentation. Adar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed a GAN based liver lesion data augmentation technique where after the extraction of ROI for classification was done using CNN. Dataset was augmented in two ways: i) the ROIs were augmented by affine transformations ii) the synthetic data was generated from ROIs using DCGAN(Deep Convolution Generative adversarial Network) and ACGAN(Auxiliary Classifier GAN). DCGAN showed greater performance compared to ACGAN. Shin, et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a GAN based model to segment tumor of brain MRI images of two traditional datasets: ADNI and BRATs. Normal brain MRI images were segmented using an image to image translation model using CGAN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Synthetic abnormal brain MRI scans were obtained from labels(tumors) by incorporating some changes in the label(e.g. increasing the size, changing the position of the label, or placing the tumor in a healthy brain MRI segmentation map). The synthetic images were used in data augmentation for training the model. Improved performance of tumor segmentation was observed by adding the synthetic data to the real data but without using normal data augmentation methods. Tom et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> simulated patho-realistic ultrasound images of the IVUS dataset using deep generative models. Tissue echogenicity maps were generated from the ground truth of the dataset. From these maps simulation of ultrasound images was produced using a physics-based simulator. Two-staged GAN was used to generate patho-realistic ultrasound images and stability of training state. In the first stage, images from the simulator were taken as input to GAN from which low-resolution images were generated. In the second stage, these low-resolution images from the first stage of GAN were transformed into high-resolution images. Bissoto et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> suggested a GAN based model to generate high-resolution images of skin lesion of the ISIC challenge dataset. Classifiers were trained on real data as well as on synthetic data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed method of synthetic data generation consists of 3 phases. Firstly, segmentation masks are collected from real images using an unsupervised method. Secondly, a CGAN is trained on these pairs of images and auto-generated segmentation masks. Two sets of synthetic segmentation masks are generated using a GAN for each of the two classes. Finally, these synthetic segmentation masks are used to guide the previously trained CGANs to generate patho-realistic samples for data augmentation.</p>

For our work, first, the contrast of the RGB cytology image is increased by the histogram stretching method. The image is then converted to a grayscale image. To eliminate the irrelevant portions, adaptive thresholding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> based segmentation algorithm is adopted and the RGB image is converted to a binary segmented mask. But the red blood cell, cytoplasm which had similar high local contrast is distinguished using the Gaussian Mixture clustering algorithm. Finally, the refined binary segmented mask is extracted. The presence of an unsupervised mask generation technique alleviates the necessity of large amount of training data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Generating RGB images from scratch using a traditional GAN is difficult as the generation procedure can be represented as a prediction of 256-dimensional multinomial distribution across three channels for each pixel. However, the segmentation mask is simply a pixel specific binomial distribution which is much easier to predict when starting without a predefined prior. Thus a CGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> must be trained which takes the segmentation masks generated in the previous step as a prior and a generator loss is reduced against the corresponding RGB image. We derive inspiration from the pix2pix network  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For the generator, we use a modified UNet like architecture. Normally the UNet architecture used transposed convolution for upscaling the feature maps. However, that results in checkerboard artifacts due to overlap of kernels during the fractional stride. Instead, bilinear interpolation opted for upscaling the feature map followed by a <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3\times 3" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">3</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">3</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">3\times 3</annotation></semantics></math> convolution layer for refinement.

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A conditional GAN(CGAN) usually generates synthetic samples conditioned by some predefined priors. In the current scenario, the CGAN has been trained to generate samples from segmentation masks highlighting the spatial distribution of nuclei across the cytoplasm. To generate patho-realistic synthetic samples during the evaluation phase a class-specific prior distribution is necessary. For that purpose, we train a GAN model  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to generate binary segmentation masks based on a randomly drawn seed from a gaussian distribution. While models like CycleGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhu2017unpaired</span>]</cite> can be used for image translation, it is not suitable for synthetic data generation. The most straight forward method to generate synthetic samples would have been to train an end-to-end GAN. However, it has been noticed in ablation studies that without a prior the quality of outputs is very poor. The primary reason being the complexity of predicting the intensity value of a pixel. Given the output image has three channels, each pixel exists within a search space with <math id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="256^{3}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">256</mn><mn id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">3</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">256</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">256^{3}</annotation></semantics></math>. However, a binary segmentation mask is a much easier output to predict given that each pixel belongs to a binomial distribution. On the other hand, the shape information encoded within these segmentation masks is quite informative about the class of the samples, namely, benign or malignant. We train two separate GANs trained on segmentation masks belonging to each of the predefined classes.</p>

The architecture of the GAN used in the current work is very similar to the one described in the previous section. It consists of a generator inspired from UNet whos transposed convolutions have been replaced with bilinear interpolation for upscaling and a convolution layer for refinement. The discriminator is derived from the PatchGAN discriminator as demonstrated in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. During the training phase, the discriminator loss is given by,</p>

The labels for real and fake samples are set as 1 and 0 by default. To enforce some fuzziness in the system, a random number between 0.9 and 1 was taken for real samples and a random number between 0.1 and 0 was taken for fake samples while training. However, this is unnecessary while training the generator as we want to bottleneck the learning curve of the discriminator and not the generator.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main objective of the work is to generate class-specific synthetic data similar to microscopic cytology images that can boost the performance of standard image classification algorithms. For our experiments we have used three classifiers namely, ResNet-152<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, Inception-V3<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and DenseNet-161<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Each of these networks has a proven track record in tough image classifications tasks such as the ILSVRC. In the original dataset, there were 156 images in total. Out of which 77 were benign samples and 79 were malignant samples. For the benefit of a cleaner calculation, a total of 150 images were selected with 75 images from each class. The dataset was randomly divided in the ratio of 3:1:1 into training, validation, and testing set with an equal number of samples in each class. The ratio of synthetic data to original training data was maintained at 2:1. Thus 90 synthetic training images were generated per class.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the present work, a CGAN based data augmentation technique has been proposed using class specific priors that improves the performance of various state of the art CNNs such as ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and Inception-V3 on cytology images corresponding to FNAC tests. Unlike a normal GAN, we have used learnable segmentation masks as class-specific priors to guide a conditional GAN for more robust synthetic data generation. It is to be noted that the method is quite dependent on the mask generation algorithm and hence extensive studies may be performed using other available nuclei segmentation techniques for further analysis. Furthermore, the method may be further generalized to adapt to other types of cytological data.</p>
