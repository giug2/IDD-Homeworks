<p id="id34.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a novel distributed privacy-preserving learning paradigm, which enables the collaboration among several participants (e.g., Internet of Things devices) for the training of machine learning models.
However, selecting the participants that would contribute to this collaborative training is highly challenging. Adopting a random selection strategy would entail substantial problems due to the heterogeneity in terms of data quality, and computational and communication resources across the participants. Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to overcome the problem of random selection, most of these approaches follow a unilateral selection strategy. In fact, they base their selection strategy on only the federated server’s side, while overlooking the interests of the client devices in the process. To overcome this problem, we present in this paper <span id="id34.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedMint</span>, an intelligent client selection approach for federated learning on IoT devices using game theory and bootstrapping mechanism. Our solution involves the design of: (1) preference functions for the client IoT devices and federated servers to allow them to rank each other according to several factors such as accuracy and price, (2) intelligent matching algorithms that take into account the preferences of both parties in their design, and (3) bootstrapping technique that capitalizes on the collaboration of multiple federated servers in order to assign initial accuracy value for the newly connected IoT devices. Based on our simulation findings, our strategy surpasses the <span id="id34.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VanillaFL</span> selection approach in terms of maximizing both the revenues of the client devices and accuracy of the global federated learning model.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>he adoption and popularity of IoT devices is surging day after day. Based on reports from the International Data Corporation (IDC), by <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2025" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2025</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">2025</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">2025</annotation></semantics></math> the world will contain around 41.6 billion IoT devices. These devices generate large amounts of data. By taking advantage of the heterogeneity and affluence of these data, businesses have the chance to improve their production and business strategies and hence increase their profits. However, most of the times, the common strategy for analyzing IoT data is to gather the data from the devices and to offload these data to a central server for training and pattern extraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This might not necessarily be scalable in the light of the exponential growth of IoT devices and significant data heterogeneity over the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Additionally, considering the vast volume of pervasive IoT data-sets in the big data age <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, coupled with the IoT devices resource constrained nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, it is becoming harder to move large amounts of data over the network to cloud data centers for centralized analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Another major concern with such an analysis strategy relates to the privacy risks stemming from the sharing of the data with third-party servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This is problematic, especially if there is sensitive information in the training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate these communication and privacy concerns, the Federated Learning (FL) concept has been recently proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The main idea of FL is to perform the training at the level of each device locally, in a distributed fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Google originally unveiled the concept of FL in 2016, when it was applied to Google keyboards to collaboratively learn from numerous Android smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. FL has the potential to revolutionize data analytics in several vital fields, including healthcare, transportation, finance, and smart homes, because it can be applied to any edge device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. A typical Federated training procedure is separated into numerous communication rounds, which are terminated once the global model achieves the intended accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The federated server (i.e, the edge server executing the FL process) first generates a generic machine learning model. Then, The server sends the global model parameters to a set of selected client devices throughout each communication cycle.
The clients train the model on their local data and send the updated parameters to the federated server, which in its turn aggregates the updated parameters to form the new global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and returns it to the clients. This procedure is repeated until the intended amount of accuracy is reached or a certain number of communication rounds are achieved.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">However, in the default federated learning process, the clients that participate in the learning rounds are selected in a random fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This might be problematic for two main reasons. First, in order for the training to take place and for the results to be communicated with the federated server, the IoT devices (hereafter, interchangeably used with <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span>) need to dedicate appropriate amounts of resources such as CPU, RAM, and bandwidth to be able to both train the model and transmit it efficiently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, this criterion is often not realized due to the resource limits of certain IoT devices, which have low computing and communication capabilities, causing considerable latencies to the synchronized parameter aggregation process at the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Second, owing to the heterogeneity at the level of the clients in federated learning, different clients might have different types of datasets with varying sizes, qualities, and distributions, a problem that is often referred to as the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) problem. Thus, selecting clients at random can result in having clients with low resources or clients that hold smaller amounts of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. This might hinder the objective of achieving a certain desired accuracy level and could result in a considerably high number of communication rounds. Furthermore, the problem of newcomer client devices is challenging and has not been appropriately addressed in the literature. The existing of newcomer IoT devices in the environment makes the selection process more complicated. Dealing with devices that can not afford any recorded data for previous interaction that can tell anything about the status of such device in order to build a decision on is very challenging. Moreover, most of the existing client selection models have a unilateral selection mechanism in which the federated servers take the selection decision based on specific standards, which results in an unfair or win-lose situation wherein the server’s needs are met while the clients’ opinions are completely neglected.</p>

First, we apply a bootstrapping method to obtain an initial accuracy value for the newly deployed IoT devices. The proposed trust bootstrapping method capitalizes on the collaboration between an active set of federated servers and a central bootstrapping server, wherein each active federated server contributes its recorded, that records the server’s interactions with a group of client IoT devices in the previous training rounds. In return, the bootstrapping server trains a Decision Tree model on the collected data and finally, delivers the predicted accuracy of the newcomer IoT device to the federated server that send the inquiry. Moreover, we employ a matching game wherein clients and federated servers with specific FL tasks are given the chance to form their own preference lists based on certain criteria. Using these lists, the matching takes place where at each FL communication round. Unlike the random selection approach, our method makes the federated servers aware of the data types that are offered by the IoT devices as well as their accuracy levels. The preferences of the IoT devices are also taken into consideration in the matching process in terms of monetary rewards.</p>

This would result in biased and sometimes unfair scenarios, where the federated server has the ultimate say as to which clients should be selected.

The matching occurs between the edge nodes in charge of the federated learning task and the end devices in a wide environment. Experiments reveal that the complete preference list matching approach performs slightly better than the matching approach by reducing the latency due to the missing information.
To manage federated learning task allocation and defend against malicious clients, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> applied a modified one-to-one two-sided matching theory between workers and task publishers, as well as a worker reputation metric. The proposed solution focuses on minimizing the job publisher’s training time as well as the worker’s energy usage. In many aspects, our strategy differs from the above mentioned two solutions. Both techniques attempt to minimize particular metrics, but our model maximizes client incentives as well as federated server global model accuracy. We are also applying a distributed version of the matching game theory, which is more compatible with the distributed nature of the federated learning. Furthermore, none of the articles cited above addressed the issue of newcomer IoT devices in FL.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Bootstrapping is a recommendation technique used in many fields, such as cloud computing where it is used in order to determine the trust level of the newly deployed cloud services, when no historical records on their previous actions exists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. In our approach, we are going to apply the bootstrapping in order to assign initial accuracy value for the newcomer IoT devices. In the proposed matching solution, federated servers sort their preference lists of IoT devices depending on the accuracy level of each IoT device. So, devices with no accuracy can’t be added to the preference list. Moreover, assigning random accuracies for such devices may result in an unjust situation for both IoT devices and federated servers. This happens when a very good IoT device gets a very low accuracy, and vice versa. The proposed method capitalizes on the collaboration of multiple active federated servers with a central bootstrapping server to help these servers to overcome the problem by providing initial accuracy for newcomer IoT devices.</p>

Each federated server maintains a dataset that records the server’s interactions with a group of client IoT devices in the previous training rounds. This dataset should include the characteristics of each IoT device that participate in the round (i.e., region, type of the device, resources usage) and most importantly the accuracy that this device has achieved in the designated round. In each round, following a joining request from a certain newcomer IoT device (Step I) to an active federated server, the entitled server is going to ask the central bootstrapping server to predict the expected accuracy for the newcomer IoT device (Step II). The bootstrapping server issues a bootstrapping request and broadcasts it to all active federated servers (Step III). Next, the active federated servers are going to upload all/part of their historical dataset to a bootstrapping central server (Step IV). Then, the central server trains a decision tree regression model on the collected datasets to predict the expected accuracy of the newcomer IoT device (Step V). Finally, the bootstrapping server sends the initial expected accuracy of the newcomer IoT device to the asking server (Step VI). Decision tree uses a tree structure to develop regression or classification models. It recursively divides a dataset sample into relatively small segments while also creating a related decision tree. As final outcome, a tree should be created with leaf nodes representing each a numerical target decision, and decision nodes that include at least two branches representing the examined attribute values. The topmost decision node in a tree known as root node, that represents the most reliable predictor that can be chosen based on certain statistical metric (e.g., Standard Deviation Reduction).</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decision tree model is a well known supervised machine learning model that capitalizes on the ID3 technique for creating decision trees. This is done by performing a greedy top-down search across the range of possible paths without backtracking<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Decision tree uses a tree structure to develop regression or classification models. The major distinction between regression and classification decision trees is that the results of classification-based decision trees are categorical, whereas the results of regression-based decision trees are continuous. The regression decision trees accept both ordered and continuous data.
The ID3 approach can be applied to create a regression decision tree by using Standard Deviation Reduction (SDR) instead of Information Gain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Standard deviation reduction technique is going to be used in order to measure the homogeneity in a feature.
Decision Tree is created in a top-down way out-of a root node by splitting the data into segments containing homogeneous samples with comparable values. To determine the uniformity of a numerical data sample, we utilize Standard Deviation (SD). A numerical sample with a low Standard Deviation is more likely to be homogeneous, whereas a sample with a high Standard Deviation is less likely to be homogeneous. The SDR is a measure of the decrease in the Standard Deviation after splitting a dataset based on a certain attribute. The most homogeneous branch is determined by the attributes that result in the greatest standard deviation decrease. The SDR of a specific feature X can be derived by subtracting the standard deviation of the target Y, i.e., SD(Y), before the split, from the standard deviation after the split by X SD(Y, X) represented by Eq.(<a href="#S4.E9" title="In IV-B Decision Tree Creation ‣ IV Bootstrapping Accuracy for Newcomer IoT Devices ‣ FedMint: Intelligent Bilateral Client Selection in Federated Learning with Newcomer IoT Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>)</p>

This dataset was generated in order to be used subsequently in the experimental analysis. The dataset stores information on the IoT devices that contribute in the federated learning rounds in terms of their type, deployment region, provider and observed accuracy. First of all, we should calculate the SD for the target which means the Accuracy denoted by SD(Accuracy). By applying the above-explained equations on the Accuracy feature we can find that:</p>

Thus, each federated server is going to be forced to contribute by its data in order to be able to make further bootstrapping requests from the bootstrapping server, to assign accuracy values for new IoT devices that can be potential clients to a certain federated learning round. Such a relationship is beneficial to both parties. In fact the federated servers can benefit by inquiring about newcomer IoT devices and get extra number of eligible bootstrapping calls. On the other hand, the bootstrapping server can benefit from the data provided by the federated servers to keep the Decision Tree model updated.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we introduced <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedMint</span>, a bilateral matching approach with newcomer IoT devices. The proposed solution takes into consideration the preferences and constraints of both the federated servers and client devices in its design, along with a trust bootstrapping system for newcomer IoT devices initial accuracy assignments. Simulation results indicate that our solution maximizes the federated learning global model accuracy from the perspective of the federated servers, and the monetary rewards from the perspective of the client IoT devices. We compared our method performance to that of the baseline random client selection FL strategy. Our findings suggest that, our approach improves accuracy by more than 20%, as well as our solution boosts income of the participating IoT devices by more than 58%.</p>
