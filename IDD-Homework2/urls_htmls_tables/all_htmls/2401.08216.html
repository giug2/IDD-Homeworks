<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their updates to affect the global model.
Although various methods exist for detecting those clients in FL, identifying malicious clients requires sufficient model updates, and hence by the time malicious clients are detected, FL models have been already poisoned. Thus, a method is needed to recover an accurate global model after malicious clients are identified. Current recovery methods rely on (i) all historical information from participating FL clients and (ii) the initial model unaffected by the malicious clients, both leading to a high demand for storage and computational resources.</p>
<p id="id6.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we show that highly effective recovery can still be achieved based on (i) selective historical information rather than all historical information and (ii) a historical model that has not been significantly affected by malicious clients rather than the initial model. In this scenario, we can accelerate the recovery speed and decrease memory consumption as well as maintaining comparable recovery performance. Following this concept, we introduce Crab, an efficient and certified recovery method, which relies on selective information storage and adaptive model rollback. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one recovered by train-from-scratch can be bounded under certain assumptions.
Our empirical evaluation, conducted across three datasets over multiple machine learning models and a variety of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks, demonstrates that Crab is not only accurate and efficient but also consistently outperforms previous approaches in terms of recovery speed and memory consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative and privacy-enhancing machine learning. In a typical FL system, data owners conduct machine learning (ML) individually on their local data, computing gradients that are subsequently aggregated to construct a global model. However, recent studies indicate that malicious clients can employ various poisoning attacks on the global model by compromising their local models through either (i) untargeted attacks aimed at slowing down the learning process or decreasing the overall performance of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, or (ii) targeted attacks (also known as backdoor attacks) that introduce a backdoor into a model, causing it to exhibit malicious behaviors when the inputs contain a predefined trigger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Many poisoning attacks can swiftly impact the global model’s performance or inject backdoors within a few FL rounds, persisting for a duration exceeding numerous rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, thereby raising significant security concerns<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Hence, various methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have been proposed to detect malicious clients either during or after the training process. However, these detection methods often require sufficient model updates to make confident decisions, and hence by the time malicious clients are identified, they may have already poisoned the global model. Consequently, there is a need for the server to recover an accurate global model from the poisoned one after the detection of malicious clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To recover the FL model from poisoning attacks after detecting malicious clients, the server can simply remove the identified malicious clients and initiate the training of a new global model from scratch conducted by the benign clients. This straightforward recovery method, despite effective, imposes significant computation and communication costs on FL clients. This drawback may limit its applicability, especially in large-scale FL systems with resource-constrained clients. Current approaches achieve efficient recovery by mitigating the impact of malicious clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, utilizing (i) all historical information from all participating FL clients and (ii) the initial model unaffected by the malicious clients. More specifically, the server stores all historical information during FL training, including the global model and clients’ gradients. Upon identifying malicious clients, the server initiates a rollback to the initial global model. Based on this initial global model, one can calibrate the clients’ historical gradients in the initial FL round and obtain a new global model. Calibrations are then iteratively conducted for each FL round. This procedure is repeated until all historical gradients are properly calibrated, indicating the assumed model recovery.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these recovery schemes that involve storing all historical information and relying solely on an unaffected model for global model recovery incur significant storage and computational costs. Meanwhile, we have observed that (i) historical information varies in importance to the global model, and (ii) malicious clients have not significantly affected the global model at the beginning of the FL training. Thus, selecting important historical information offers sufficient information for recovery. Furthermore, employing a historical global model that has not been too much affected by malicious clients can be adequate to recover a reasonably accurate global model from the poisoned one. The above indicates that highly effective recovery can still be achieved based on (i) selective storage of important historical global models and clients’ gradients rather than all historical information, and (ii) adaptive rollback to a global model that has not been significantly affected by the malicious clients rather than the initial model. In this case, the recovery speed can be accelerated, and memory consumption can be reduced. Following this concept, we introduce Crab (an acronym for “Certified Recovery from poisoning Attack” and a metaphor illustrating that our method shares regenerative capabilities with a crab after encountering attacks), an efficient and certified recovery method, which relies on selective information storage and adaptive model rollback.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, Crab implements selective information storage at the round level and the client level. In other words, the server selects which FL rounds exhibit a rapid change in the global model and which clients significantly impact the change in these selected rounds. Based on these selections, the server stores the corresponding historical information. After identifying the malicious clients, the server is tasked with determining an optimal rollback model concerning the malicious clients. In Crab, the server calculates the sensitivity of all stored historical models to the malicious clients and designates the most recent one of which the sensitivity does not surpass a pre-defined threshold, as the rollback model. Based on the selected historical information and the designated rollback model, the benign clients follow the standard workflow for the recovery process adapted for Crab, as demonstrated in <a href="#S1.F1" title="In I Introduction ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Theoretically, we demonstrate that the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one recovered by train-from-scratch has an upper bounded under certain assumptions. This indicates the effectiveness of recovery and the certified client removal provided by Crab.
Empirically, our experiments over various datasets and different poisoning attacks settings can effectively demonstrate the superiority of proposed Crab in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, it consistently outperforms previous approaches in terms of recovery speed and memory consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Related works.</span> The idea of recovering a global model from a poisoned one in a federated learning setting is related to the concept of federated unlearning (FU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Specifically, model recovery in federated learning can be conceptualized as the process of unlearning one or more detected malicious clients, involving making the global model forget the model updates contributed by these identified malicious clients. The works most closely related to Crab are FedEraser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and FedRecover <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, both of which achieve unlearning or recovery based on historical information and the initial global model. A difference between these two works is that in FedEraser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the server stores historical information at intervals of every fixed number of rounds, whereas in FedRecover <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the server stores historical information for all FL rounds.
However, both FedEraser and FedRecover require high memory consumption and computational cost.
In contrast, Crab stores only important historical information from selected FL rounds and rolls back the model to a recent historical one, as opposed to the initial model. Crab has the capability to remarkably reduce storage space and computational cost, with only a marginal trade-off in performance.</p>

Initially introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the trim attack is an untargeted poisoning attack designed to disrupt the correct optimization trajectory of the global model in federated learning. It achieves this by carefully crafting malicious model updates. These updates may involve adding random Gaussian noise, replacing certain parameter values, or omitting specific values. While the trim attack was primarily developed for the Trimmed-mean aggregation rule, it has also proven effective with other aggregation methods, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

Backdoor attacks in machine learning involve embedding a distinct pattern or “trigger” into training data portions, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This trigger could be a conspicuous element like a small patch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, or subtle alterations in benign samples that are less perceptible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. While the model behaves normally with standard inputs, it responds maliciously to inputs with this hidden trigger. The danger of backdoor attacks stems from their dormant nature, becoming active only under the attacker’s control.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As described earlier, in the state-of-the-art scheme FedRecover <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the server stores all historical global models and clients’ gradients during the FL training process. After the malicious clients are detected, the server rolls back the global model to the initial one, from which recovery is conducted based on stored historical information. Compared to FedRecover <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, our proposed scheme, Crab, ensures a more efficient recovery through two key strategies: (i) selective storage of important historical information rather than all historical information, and (ii) adaptive rollback to a global model that has not been significantly affected by the malicious clients rather than the initial model. The overall Crab scheme is shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In this section, we will present the detailed designs for these two strategies within the full description of the Crab scheme. Additionally, we will provide a theoretical analysis of the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one obtained through train-from-scratch.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Round selection.</span> We observe that throughout the FL training process, the global model converges at varying rates in different rounds. A larger rate indicates a more significant change in the global model, emphasizing the greater importance of the updates, i.e., the gradients, are more important for the global model. Therefore, selectively storing these important gradients allows for a substantial reduction in memory consumption while preserving the performance of the unlearning algorithm.
We utilize Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure the difference between a global model and the global model in the subsequent FL round.
KL divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second probability distribution and used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Comparing the KL divergence between two models can provide insights into how much the models differ from each other. Besides, KL divergence has been a widely employed metric for evaluating the distinction between two ML models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. A higher KL divergence indicates a more significant change in the global model, emphasizing the greater importance of the gradients in that FL round, which are then selected for storage with a higher probability.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To implement round selection based on KL divergence during FL training, we instruct the server to buffer, i.e., store in a temporary memory, historical gradients from all FL rounds within a specified time window. The server then assesses the KL divergence of these stored historical gradients with the global model, distinguishing between important gradients to store and non-important ones to discard. After that, the selection process moves on to the next specified time window. The calculation of the time window is based on achieving a fixed percentage reduction in the loss of the global model.</p>

A larger contribution indicates a more significant impact on the global model updating, emphasizing the greater importance of the client for the global model. Therefore, selectively storing gradients from these important clients allows for a further reduction in memory consumption while preserving the performance of the unlearning algorithm. We employ cosine similarity to assess the direction similarity between a client’s update, i.e., gradients, and the global update, i.e., the aggregated gradients from all participating clients, in the same FL round, a widely employed metric for evaluating the similarity between two vectors in an FL setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. A higher Cosine similarity indicates a more substantial contribution of the client to the global model, indicating a greater importance of the clients in that FL round, which are then selected for storage with a higher probability.</p>

Recovery then proceeds from this point. However, when the FL training involves many iterations, this recovery approach also requires numerous iterations, leading to significant computation and communication expenses. Fortunately, we find that rolling back to a historical model that has not been affected too much by malicious clients and conducting recovery from there is still effective. In this scenario, the recovery performance remains comparable, but the number of iterations required for the recovery process is substantially reduced, thereby significantly enhancing efficiency.</p>

In our experiments, we evaluate the convergence rates of different recovery methods across several datasets, as shown in <a href="#S4.F3" title="In IV-C Theoretical Analysis ‣ IV Design of Crab ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Our observations reveal that by selectively storing clients and utilizing historical global information, we can match the convergence speed of FedEraser, which uses small intervals for updates. Despite FedEraser theoretically setting an upper limit for our method due to its practical implementation with an interval of one, our method, Crab, closely aligns with FedEraser convergence curve after 20 rounds. Conversely, FedRecover, which employs the L-BFGS algorithm for calculating the Hessian matrix, not only increases the computation time per iteration but also shows significant instability, indicated by frequent extreme values in its convergence curve, necessitating periodic correction. Besides, we calculate the running time of each recovery round in various datasets, as shown in <a href="#S5.T3" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Similarly, Crab demonstrates a clear advantage in terms of running time, which shows the superiority of selective storage strategy in improving the efficiency of recovery process.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our adaptive rollback strategy also contributes to efficiency by eliminating the need to start from scratch each time. This approach proves particularly effective when dealing with varying proportions of malicious users. For instance, when the proportion is low, the rollback can commence from the 5th to 7th rounds, conserving computational resources. In cases where malicious users comprise up to 50%, the rollback typically adjusts to start from the 2nd to 3rd rounds.</p>

We first present the recovery performance results under various backdoor attack ratios, shown in <a href="#S5.F4" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. We find that for backdoor attacks when the attack intensity is at 10%, the impact on the FedAvg algorithm is limited. However, when the attack ratio increases to 50%, a significant drop in test set accuracy is observed, falling to only 46.69%. At this point, using our recovery algorithm Crab, the accuracy of the recovered global model can be restored to 88.11%, which is only a 5% decrease compared to the 93.28% achieved with retraining. In the other two datasets, as shown in <a href="#S5.F5" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we directly apply the strongest attack ratio and observe similar results: the Crab algorithm demonstrates superior recovery performance on both the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with accuracy of 78.97% and 46.61% respectively, significantly surpassing the FedRecover algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding trim attacks, we arrive at a similar conclusion, shown in <a href="#S5.F6" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The Crab algorithm achieved an accuracy of 89.43%, 87.67%, and 63.07% on the three datasets, respectively. Compared to the performance of the poisoned global model, our method can effectively recover the model from attack.</p>

When evaluating a recovery algorithm, it is essential to consider not only its high accuracy on test datasets but also its ability to prevent malicious outputs. For instance, in the case of backdoor attacks, it is crucial to assess whether the global model still exhibits predetermined results when fed data containing a trigger. Our findings, illustrated in the <a href="#S5.F7" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, show that the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of the recovered global models has decreased to around 10%. It is important to note that the target client’s predefined output (with the trigger) is set to 0 so roughly 10% of the data is thus correctly labelled. 10% ASR suggests that the attack is almost ineffective against the recovered global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we evaluate whether the datasets of the target clients are still part of the recovered model’s training base by using membership inference attacks. <a href="#S5.F7" title="In V-B Evaluation Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> reveals a substantial decrease in the Membership Inference Success Rate (MISR) compared to Federated Learning (FL). For example, on the MNIST dataset, the MISR is down to 37.97%. This indicates the effectiveness of our recovery framework.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we introduce Crab, an efficient and certified method for recovering the global model from poisoning attacks, utilizing selective storage and adaptive rollback strategies. Theoretical analysis validates that the model difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one recovered by training from scratch can be bounded under specific assumptions.
Our experiments affirm that Crab, while saving storage and computational costs, maintains the effectiveness and stability of model recovery. Furthermore, we explore the impact of Crab parameters on the trade-off between resource consumption and recovery accuracy. Crab surpasses other existing methods in both recovery speed and resource utilization.</p>
