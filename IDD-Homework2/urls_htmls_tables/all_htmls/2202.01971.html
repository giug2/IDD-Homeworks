<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has recently emerged as a paradigm promising the benefits of harnessing rich data from diverse sources to train high quality models, with the salient features that training datasets never leave local devices. Only model updates are locally computed and shared for aggregation to produce a global model. While federated learning greatly alleviates the privacy concerns as opposed to learning with centralized data, sharing model updates still poses privacy risks. In this paper, we present a system design which offers efficient protection of individual model updates throughout the learning procedure, allowing clients to only provide obscured model updates while a cloud server can still perform the aggregation. Our federated learning system first departs from prior works by supporting lightweight encryption and aggregation, and resilience against drop-out clients with no impact on their participation in future rounds. Meanwhile, prior work largely overlooks bandwidth efficiency optimization in the ciphertext domain and the support of security against an actively adversarial cloud server, which we also fully explore in this paper and provide effective and efficient mechanisms. Extensive experiments over several benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA) show our system achieves accuracy comparable to the plaintext baseline, with practical performance.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has rapidly emerged as a fascinating machine learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> which allows models to be trained on data dispersed over a number of mobile devices while each client can keep its dataset locally.
Clients never share the raw datasets, and instead only periodically share model updates locally trained with their datasets, which are then aggregated by a coordinating server to produce a global model.
Federated learning thus promises reaping the benefits of harnessing rich data from diverse sources to train high quality models, without clients being worried about the security and privacy risks of centralizing their raw data to a single place for training as in conventional practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While sharing model updates instead of raw datasets has greatly alleviated the privacy concerns as opposed to learning with centralized data, it still entails risks of private information leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Protection of individual model updates is thus still necessary.
Additively homomorphic encryption, which allows addition of private plaintext values to be securely performed over their ciphertexts, offers a feasible solution.
Some recent works using this technique for building privacy-preserving federated learning systems have been presented <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
However, homomorphic encryption is expensive and also poses additional trust assumptions (e.g., sharing a private key across data holders) in the context of federated learning (see Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Related Work ‣ Aggregation Service for Federated Learning: An Efficient, Secure, and More Resilient Realization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> for more discussion).
A different work is due to Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which is free of expensive cryptography and allows lightweight encryption and aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When designing secure federated learning systems, resilience against drop-out clients failing to submit model updates for aggregation is a practical requirement as some clients may face issues like poor network connections, energy constraints, or temporary unavailability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> provides mechanisms to handle drop-out clients, yet it undesirably prevents drop-out clients from directly and safely engaging in any future rounds of aggregation unless a new key setup is re-conducted.
Therefore, how to achieve secure and lightweight processing in federated learning while maintaining practical drop-out resilience with no impact on drop-out clients’ participation in any future rounds remains to be fully explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, most of prior works largely overlook the communication efficiency aspect of federated learning in the encrypted domain, which could be affected due to ciphertext size expansion or loss of precision in training due to the adaption of plaintext processing for compatibility with cryptographic processing.
Furthermore, most of them only provide semi-honest security against the passively adversarial server, assuming the server faithfully conduct the designated processing, and they are not resilient to an active adversary that may compromise the integrity of the processing at the server side.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the above observations, in this paper, we present a new system design enabling federated learning services with lightweight secure and resilient aggregation.
Our system enables clients holding proprietary datasets to only provide obscured model updates while aggregation can still be supported at a cloud server to produce a global model.
By newly adapting a cherry-picked aggregation protocol for federated learning that we identified from the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, our system promises practical efficiency on encrypting the model updates at the client as well as aggregating the obscured model updates at the cloud server.
No expensive cryptographic operations are required throughout the federated learning procedure.
Meanwhile, our system is drop-out resilient and outperforms the best prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> in the sense that the secret keys of drop-out clients are kept private so they still can directly participate at a later stage without the need for a new key setup.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">With the above new secure design point for federated learning as a basis, we explore and present refinements in terms of boosted communication efficiency and stronger security.
We start with consideration on the communication side, a known bottleneck for federated learning, due to various reasons like large sized models, limited client uplink bandwidth, and large numbers of participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
We thus explore the potential of compressing model updates before secure aggregation so as to reduce the communication overheads in our system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, various kinds of techniques for compressing the model updates have been proposed, such as sparsification, subsampling, and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Our observation is that quantization delicately represents the (fractional) values in a model update as integers, which is also the type of data required for secure aggregation.
So our insight is to integrate the advancements in quantization with secure aggregation.
However, most of existing quantization schemes are not secure aggregation friendly, as de-quantization requiring computation beyond summation has to be conducted before the quantized model updates can be aggregated.
We make an observation that a newly developed quantization technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> (originally tailored for homomorphic encryption) can suit our purpose as no de-quantization is required before aggregation.
Building on this new technique, our system allows clients to provide obscured quantized model updates, achieving a reduction in the communication overhead.
To correctly integrate this quantization technique and make it function well, we address some practical considerations in our system including the prevention of overflow in aggregating quantized values and the identification of negative values in de-quantization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the boosted communication efficiency side, we also investigate mechanisms to make our system more resilient, achieving stronger security against an actively adversarial cloud server, beyond the semi-honest security setting commonly assumed.
The goal here is to ensure that the processing for the federated learning service is correctly enforced at the cloud server.
Aiming for a pragmatic solution, we resort to the emerging techniques of hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs) to shield the computation integrity at the cloud server side throughout the federated learning procedure.
As a practical instantiation, our system makes use of the increasingly popular Intel SGX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
We do not rely on the confidentiality guarantee which is originally targeted by trusted hardware, due to the emergence of various side-channel attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
This is different from most of existing works which assume both confidentiality and integrity when using trusted hardware for secure computation.
We give the abstract functionality assumed out of trusted hardware for our federated learning system, and further present a concrete protocol that renders federated learning with secure aggregation with computation integrity against an actively adversarial server.</p>

We evaluate the accuracy evolution over varying rounds and demonstrate our system shares similar behavior with the plaintext baseline and achieve comparable accuracy, even if quantization is applied to the model updates (which achieves up to <math id="S1.p9.4.m4.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="4\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p9.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S1.p9.4.m4.1b"><mn id="S1.p9.4.m4.1.1">4</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S1.p9.4.m4.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p9.4.m4.1c">4\times</annotation></semantics></math> reduction in communication).

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some works rely on expensive homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, incurring high performance overheads.
The use of homomorphic encryption also requires all clients to either share a common secret key <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, or hold secret key shares which have to be generated via expensive multi-party protocols or distributed by a trusted third party (TTP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> propose a scheme using functional encryption, requiring a TTP for setting up keys as well as getting involved in the learning process.
Our system is free of such a TTP.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Bonawitz et al. propose a lightweight encryption scheme supporting secure aggregation for federated learning.
Their scheme can handle drop-out clients in an aggregation round, but would reveal their secret keys.
When the scheme is used in federated learning, drop-out clients in a certain round are thus not able to directly and safely participate in any future rounds <em id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unless</em> a new key setup is conducted.
We note that the design of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has a double-masking mechanism, which is to prevent the server from learning the data of users who are too late in sending their masked vectors and are assumed to drop-out by the server (so the server recovers their secret keys).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are some follow-up works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> that attempt to the improve <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> from the <em id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">performance</em> aspect, yet they require additional assumptions regarding client topology information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> or delicate privacy-efficiency balance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the work of So et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> applies a multi-group circular strategy for model aggregation, which partitions clients into communication groups and operates under a multi-group communication structure that relies on the topology of users and leads to a number of execution stages that has to be conducted sequentially across the groups.
Each client in a group has to communicate with every client in the next group.
The work of Choi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> has to appropriately organize clients in a graph structure based on the specific topology information and uses the graph to represent how public keys and secret shares are assigned to the other clients, so each client is aware of its neighboring clients.
The work of Kadhe et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> constructs a multi-secret sharing scheme and leverages it to design a secure aggregation scheme, which needs to delicately balance the trade-off between the number of secrets, privacy threshold, and dropout tolerance.
Meanwhile, the resilience against client dropout is restricted to some pre-set <em id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">constant</em> fraction of clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The most related prior work thus is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Compared with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, our system also allows lightweight encryption for the clients but does not reveal the secret keys of drop-out clients in any rounds.
That said, drop-out or non-selected clients in a certain round are still able to directly have safe participation in future rounds in our system.
It is noted that the protocol in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> consists of multiple rounds (including key setup), which need to be all executed over the clients selected in each iteration when applied to federated learning.
Given the possibility of client drop-out being considered, it may not be promising to assume that each selected client in an iteration will well get involved in those interactions for key setup. A new key setup in each iteration of federated learning thus might hinder that iteration in proceeding normally.
Indeed, once the number of dropped clients (with all interactions rounds considered in an iteration of federated learning) exceeds a threshold, the current iteration of federated learning has to abort and start over.
In contrast, our protocol has minimal interactions among the selected clients and the server in each iteration of federated learning.
In fact, as opposed to plaintext-domain federated learning, our protocol just needs one additional round of interaction for handling client drop-out upon secure aggregation.
It is further worth noting that compared with existing works, our system ambitiously and newly provides assurance on computation integrity against the cloud server.

<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our work is also relevant to prior work on building hardware-assisted security applications.
Most of existing works assume confidentiality and integrity guarantees from the trusted hardware (e.g., Intel SGX) for secure computation (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, to just list a few).
Given that the confidentiality guarantees may face threats from various side-channel attacks, a trending practice is to relax the trust assumptions and only assume integrity.
A few works have been presented in different contexts including zero-knowledge proofs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, multi-party machine learning inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, client-side checking of model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and aggregation over blockchain-stored data under homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Inspired by this trend, our system only assumes minimally trusted hardware with integrity guarantees, and explores a new design point for enforcing server-side computation correctness throughout the federated learning procedure.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Trusted hardware techniques (e.g., Intel SGX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) allow the creation of protected memory regions called enclaves which are isolated from the rest of a host’s software, including the operating system.
Trusted hardware is designed with the aim of offering confidentiality and integrity assurance.
Yet, it has been recently shown that the confidentiality guarantee may be compromised by a series of side-channel attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
The goal of achieving confidentiality with trusted hardware thus remains elusive so far.
A recent trend on building trusted hardware based security applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is thus to only leverage the computational integrity.
By relying on only the integrity, it is assumed that the internal states (i.e., all the code and data) of enclaves are transparent to the host (or the corrupted party).
Only secure code attestation and secure signing functionality are required.
Enclaves with such minimal trust assumption are referred to as transparent enclaves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

The requester wants to harness the power of federated learning and releases a task via the secure federated learning service.
Such service could be hosted on the cloud, and run by a cloud server.
Here the cloud server is an abstraction and can be implemented by an actual server or a cluster of servers.
The clients are data owners interested in working on the federated learning task and sign up at the cloud server.
All participants in the system agree in advance on a common machine learning model architecture and common learning objective.
The clients may receive rewards from the requester for the participation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To realize the secure federated learning service, our first aim is that in each round the cloud server should be able to perform aggregation of the individual model updates without seeing them in the clear.
So, we will craft our design such that each client selected in a round can just provide an obscured model update, which still effectively allows aggregation.
For high efficiency, our system will preclude the use of expensive homomorphic encryption and only rely on lightweight cryptography.
Considering that communication is a known bottleneck in federated learning, our system will also cherry-pick and integrate appropriate quantization techniques to compress the model updates, so that a client can just share an obscured and quantized model update.</p>

While theoretically (expensive) cryptography-based verifiable computation techniques may help <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we aim for a pragmatic solution and observe the trending practice is to leverage hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Our system follows this trend and only assumes a minimally trusted hardware with integrity guarantees.
Specifically, we will rely on a transparent enclave to shield the computation integrity at the cloud server.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our system for secure federated learning considers an adversarial cloud server.
It could be semi-honest, which means the cloud server will honestly follow the protocol for the federated learning service, yet is curious about individual model updates so as to infer clients’ local datasets.
The semi-honest threat model is commonly adopted in privacy-preserving data-centric services in cloud computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
For this setting our system aims to maintain the confidentiality of individual model updates. The cloud server is only allowed to learn an aggregate model update and global model.
Beyond the semi-honest adversary setting, a stronger threat model will also be considered where the cloud server may not correctly follow the designated computation.
For this setting, our system further aims to enforce correct computation at the cloud server besides the confidentiality of individual model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Collusion between the cloud server and a subset of selected clients in each round is also likely, and for such case our system aims to maintain the confidentiality of model updates of honest clients.
Here, we are not concerned with the extreme (and also hardly realistic given that clients are many and geographically distributed) case that there is only one honest client and all other clients are compromised by the cloud server.
Note that the assumption of at least one honest client is necessary in the problem of secure data aggregation and also (either explicitly or implicitly assumed) in existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
It is obvious that for any practical secure aggregation schemes that securely compute the sum, if the aggregator colludes with all but one of the clients, the data of the colluding clients can be surely removed from the sum and the honest client’s data will be revealed.
Therefore, like existing works, our system does not provide data protection against the extreme colluding case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is noted that our system currently does not protect against possible attacks on the aggregate model updates and global model, which can directly be mitigated by letting clients do noise addition as per complementary differential privacy techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Adversarial attacks like poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> are complementary research areas and out the scope of this work.</p>

Meanwhile, our system should be able to work without a trusted third party for setting up keys for secure aggregation and/or assistance in the learning procedure.
All these practical requirements preclude considerations on the use of expensive homomorphic encryption which is also confronted with key distributions issues as mentioned before.
Recall that although the secure aggregation scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> allows lightweight encryption and aggregation without a trusted third party, it reveals the secret keys of drop-out clients in an aggregation round, which consequently prevents them from direct participation in future rounds unless a new key setup is conducted in a subsequent round.</p>

We resort to this protocol due to the observations that it does not involve heavy cryptographic operations (only lightweight hashing and arithmetic operations are needed), does not require a trusted third party, and will not reveal the secret keys of drop-out clients.
With this protocol as a basis, we craft a thorough design for federated learning with secure aggregation of individual model updates.

Note that as required by the cryptographic computation, the values in the vector representing the local model update should integers, which, however, could be fractional values in practice.
We adopt a common scaling factor trick where a large enough scaling factor is used to scale up a fractional value into an integer.

It is likely that a selected client in a round may not actually participate (i.e., submitting a model update), due to reasons like poor network connections, energy constraints, or temporary unavailability.
We call such clients drop-out clients.
In such case, the cloud server would not be able to directly obtain the correct aggregation result, because the sum of the blinding factors is not zero.
Therefore, our system should be able to handle the drop-out clients in a certain round and ensure that the obscured model updates of the responding clients can still be correctly aggregated.

For client grouping, different guidelines might be adopted, such as geographical proximity.
Note that group management also benefits fault tolerance.
This is because each group is independent so the faults in a certain group will not affect other groups.
Only the clients in the same group will be involved to handle the faults.
The impact of faults on the overall system is thus effectively mitigated.
One trade-off here is that the cloud server learns aggregated model updates from clients in independent groups. Yet, individual clients’ model updates in each group are still protected.
The group size can be set in advance according to the agreement between the cloud server and the clients.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Communication could be a bottleneck for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, because the trained machine learning models are usually of large sizes, clients may have limited uplink bandwidth, and the number of clients could be large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
As in each round a selected client communicates the model update to the cloud server, reducing the model update size could be highly beneficial to improve the communication efficiency of the whole system.
In the literature, researchers have studied various kinds of techniques for compressing model updates such as sparsification, subsampling, and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Among these techniques, our observation is that quantization delicately represents the values in a model update as integers, exhibiting compatibility with cryptographic aggregation.
Therefore, we choose to leverage the advancements in quantization to support secure aggregation while achieving a reduction in communication cost, and thus kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Quantization based communication efficiency optimization for distributed machine learning has received considerable traction in recent years (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, to just list a few).
However, most of existing quantization techniques are not secure aggregation friendly, as they require a de-quantization operation, which demands computation much more complicated than secure aggregation, to be performed before doing the aggregation.
What we need here is thus a quantization scheme which can support aggregation directly over quantized values.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We adapt the above quantization technique for our system to simultaneously achieve lightweight cryptographic aggregation and high communication efficiency.
Such delicate integration leads to our refined protocol for secure federated learning, which is shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ 6.1 Quantization Technique ‣ 6 Leveraging Quantization for Boosted Communication Efficiency ‣ Aggregation Service for Federated Learning: An Efficient, Secure, and More Resilient Realization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
Compared with the process shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 5.2 Protocol ‣ 5 Empowering Federated Learning with Secure and Efficient Aggregation ‣ Aggregation Service for Federated Learning: An Efficient, Secure, and More Resilient Realization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the main difference is that in each round, after training a local model, each selected client sends an obscured quantized model update to the cloud server.
The cloud server then performs aggregation over these obscured quantized model updates and produces an updated global model.</p>

As an instantiation, we resort to Intel SGX due to its wide integration in commodity processors.
SGX enables the execution of programs in secure enclaves that are isolated from all other applications on the same host.
It also provides attestation mechanisms which assure the integrity of the program loaded into the enclave once it has been attested.
In particular, a signed attestation report can be generated for the program being loaded, which allows anyone to verify based on a public key corresponding to Intel’s report signing key.

<p id="S8.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implement the client with Python.
The PyTorch is used for model training.
For the federated learning service, we use C++ since the official SGX SDK only has C++ interfaces.
We adopt Thrift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> to enable cross-language communication.
That is, the federated learning service is implemented as a daemon on a Thrift server that provides the corresponding interface which can be invoked by a service client generated as Python scripts.
Each client uses the service client to connect with the server to upload the model update.
The daemon passes the model update to the enclave and gets the global model and its signature as the result.
In our experiments, we manage to get rid of expensive EPC paging in the enclave by temporarily storing all received (obscured) model updates and their signatures in the untrusted memory of the host server.
Aggregation in the enclave is then performed by reading in and verifying the (obscured) model updates one by one.

It is observed that the use of an appropriate scaling factor does not adversely affect the accuracy as the number of rounds grows. As long as a large scaling factor is used, the model accuracy is maintained with respect to the plaintext baseline. Such accuracy preservation is also consistent with the literature that uses the trick of scaling factor for cryptographic computation (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, to just list a few).

The legend “scaling” refers to the setting where a scaling factor (<math id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10^{7}" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mn id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">7</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">10</cn><cn type="integer" id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">7</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">10^{7}</annotation></semantics></math>) is used to scale up the fractional values in model updates into 32-bit integers to support computation in the cryptographic aggregation protocol.
The legend “8/16-bit quantization” refers to the setting where a 8-/16-bit quantizer is applied over the fractional values in model updates, leading to 8-/16-bit integers for supporting communication efficiency optimization in the ciphertext domain.
It can be observed that our secure protocols share similar behavior with the baseline and achieve comparable accuracy.
The unique integration of quantization (with adequate bit width) does not adversely affect the quality of the trained model either.</p>

<p id="S8.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the IID setting, following the seminal work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> on federated learning, we further examine the non-IID setting over the MNIST dataset.
The non-IID data distribution is set up by sorting the training images according to the digit labels, dividing them into shards of size <math id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="300" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">300</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1">300</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS2.p5.1.m1.1c">300</annotation></semantics></math>, and randomly distributing two shards to each client.
We show the accuracy evaluation result in Fig. <a href="#S8.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 8.1 Setup ‣ 8 Experiments ‣ Aggregation Service for Federated Learning: An Efficient, Secure, and More Resilient Realization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, which demonstrates similar behavior and comparable accuracy to the plaintext baseline.
Note that data heterogeneity is related to the federated learning paradigm itself and is independent of our security design.
There are no ties between data heterogeneity and client drop-out.
Client-dropout only affects the actual number of model updates being aggregated to produce the global model. Our system ensures the correctness of secure aggregation even in case of client-dropout.</p>

It is revealed that our protocol with security against an active adversarial cloud server (i.e., computation integrity against the cloud server) incurs almost no overhead over the semi-honest setting (<math id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="1\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">1</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">1\times</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="1.005\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><mn id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">1.005</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1c">1.005\times</annotation></semantics></math>, and <math id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="1.013\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><mn id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">1.013</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1c">1.013\times</annotation></semantics></math> over the MNIST, CIFAR, and CelebA models respectively).

<p id="S8.SS3.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the server-side cost, it is observed that as the dropout rate and the fraction of selected clients increase, our design (semi-honest adv. setting) consumes less computation.
This is because the server in their scheme needs to perform reconstruction of secret keys over collected secret shares and re-compute masks to be subtracted from the aggregate sum over the online clients.
We emphasize that unlike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, our system does not reveal the secret keys of drop-out clients, so their direct participation in future rounds is not affected.
Meanwhile, our system can also provide much stronger security (computation integrity) against the server with minimal overhead, as demonstrated above.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a system design for federated learning, which allows clients to provide obscured model updates while aggregation can still be supported.
Our system first departs from prior works by building on a cherry-picked cryptographic aggregation protocol, which promises the advantages of lightweight encryption and aggregation as well as the ability to handle drop-out clients without exposing their secret keys.
For higher communication efficiency, our system also adapts the latest advancements in quantization techniques for compressing individual model updates.
Furthermore, our system also provides security beyond the common semi-honest adversary setting, ensuring the computation integrity at the cloud server.
We conduct an extensive evaluation over popular benchmark datasets, and the results validate the practical performance of our system.</p>
