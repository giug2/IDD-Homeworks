<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">To satisfy the expected plethora of computation-heavy applications, federated edge learning (FEEL) is a new paradigm featuring distributed learning to carry the capacities of low-latency and privacy-preserving.
To further improve the efficiency of wireless data aggregation and model learning, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is emerging as a promising solution by using the superposition characteristics of wireless channels.
However, the fading and noise of wireless channels can cause aggregate distortions in AirComp enabled federated learning. In addition, the quality of collected data and energy consumption of edge devices may also impact the accuracy and efficiency of model aggregation as well as convergence.
To solve these problems, this work proposes a dynamic device scheduling mechanism, which can select qualified edge devices to transmit their local models with a proper power control policy so as to participate the model training at the server in federated learning via AirComp.
In this mechanism, the data importance is measured by the gradient of local model parameter, channel condition and energy consumption of the device jointly.
In particular, to fully use distributed datasets and accelerate the convergence rate of federated learning, the local updates of unselected devices are also retained and accumulated for future potential transmission, instead of being discarded directly.
Furthermore, the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization problem is formulated for searching the optimal device selection strategy.
Simulation results validate that the proposed scheduling mechanism can achieve higher test accuracy and faster convergence rate, and is robust against different channel conditions.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Future intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks are envisioned to experience a profound reformation from connecting massive things to connecting ubiquitous intelligence, which promotes the era of big data and puts forward stringent requirements of ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC), energy efficiency, intelligence, and security.
In response, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have been expected as important technologies to be widely introduced in wireless IoT networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Due to their unique characteristics of universality, autonomy and adaptive optimization, ML and AI technologies can assist to support increasing multi-media and AI-empowered applications, by providing advanced wireless communications and computing capacities.
However, the astounding growth of AI applications and data volume generated by network edges bring heavy computation and communication workloads <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Especially for the traditional centralized training architecture relying on central or cloud servers, training computationally intensive tasks and transmitting such a mass of data will impose large latency and heavy traffic burden <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In addition, uploading local data to the server directly makes privacy security and preservation face significant challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Aiming at these problems, distributed machine learning has been proposed to enable intelligent edges to train learning models collaboratively without uploading their local data to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was proposed by Google to enable collaborative training without sharing local datasets of edge devices, orchestrated by a server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
A typical federated learning is realized through a separated communication-and-computation approach.
Specifically, each device runs the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm locally using the current global model, broadcasted by the server.
Then device updates are aggregated at the server for the global model updating.
In this implementation, however, uploading local models over wireless channels might be resource-demanding, although the size of local models is much smaller than that of raw data observed locally.
On the other hand, training the global model at the server is to obtain certain kinds of functions of local models such as their weighted average instead of the individual model updates.
However, the traditional model aggregation in federated learning requires accurate timely signal reception and decoding of local model parameters, which results in unnecessary communication and computing resource consumption.
As an alternative, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently emerged as a promising solution to achieve fast and communication-efficient wireless data aggregation without precise distributed reception, especially for IoT applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">AirComp, as a combination scheme of communication and computation, has been shown as a communication-efficient approach to compute and train the target characteristic by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Different from the transmissions via wireless channels in federated learning,
AirComp enables a “one-shot” data aggregation from concurrent transmissions to harness the interferences
and the server receives the superimposed signals to be reconstructed, which is also aligned with the concept of secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
By designing appropriate pre-processing and post-processing functions at the edge devices and the server, respectively, AirComp can be well-suited to the federated edge learning (FEEL) systems regarding to high communication efficiency and low latency demands.
In addition,
efficient device scheduling mechanisms, including power control, device selection, resource allocation, etc., can be realized to improve the accuracy and efficiency of model aggregation in FEEL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
In this work, we will investigate the dynamic device control and management mechanisms aiming to optimize the synthetic performance, including training accuracy, energy efficiency, etc., of the designed AirComp enabled FEEL system.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is becoming an emerging paradigm for enabling ML and AI at the wireless edge devices, in which edge devices train a global model collaboratively, and upload their local models by applying orthogonal multiple access based resource allocation schemes, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).
However, the required radio resources are linearly scaling with a large number of edge devices with
limited bandwidth and power, which introduces a substantial communication latency and resource consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, it is important to investigate communication-efficient mechanisms for the realization and implementation of a federated learning framework with high training accuracy, energy efficiency and low latency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there have been significant efforts to incorporate physical and network layer characteristics of wireless networks into communication-efficient federated learning.
In order to optimize the training speed and model accuracy, an accelerated gradient-descent multiple access algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> by using momentum-based gradient signals over multiple access noisy fading multiple access channels.
Under the resource constraint, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a learning control algorithm with the best tradeoff between local updates and global parameter aggregation.
Considering the redundant observations and diversity of devices in terms of local datasets, channel conditions, energy status, etc., many studies have paid attention to designing efficient device scheduling policies, according to which only parts of devices are selected and scheduled to participate the global model updating in each iteration.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors
designed a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient device scheduling mechanism, in which both differential privacy and communication costs were considered to make less frequent communications with fewer devices participation.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> optimized the user selection and resource allocation mechanism jointly to minimize the training loss of federated learning.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a communication-efficient device selection strategy by selecting a set of more informative devices, which can improve the convergence speed, fairness and learning efficiency.
A framework for low-latency broadband federated learning was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> by taking channel state information into consideration.
In addition, the channel conditions and local model updates were both formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to develop a device scheduling and resource allocation mechanism in federated learning.
However, most current studies only took the channel condition and model update into consideration, ignoring the energy efficiency and lacking a comprehensive evaluation and modeling of device quality.
Moreover, in the studies above, the model update information of unselected devices was discarded, which led to an incomplete utilization of data samples observed in FEEL systems.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The research of AirComp mainly focuses on addressing the channel distortion.
Some novel works have considered designing the transmitter and receiver policy with the objective of minimizing the computation mean-square error (MSE), based on which a sum-power constraint was considered to better distribute the power to the devices in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Also, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a novel M-frequency AirComp system to accommodate a large scale of devices,
and spatial-and-temporal correlated signals were considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> for a more practical and realistic scenario.
In recent years, the AirComp technique has been integrated into federated learning to improve the learning performance referring to radio resource and energy efficiency, training convergence and accuracy, etc.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, a power control policy for AirComp enabled federated learning was investigated by introducing the gradient statistics.
A modified federated learning algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to optimize the local learning rates and adapt the fading channel.
Based on the convergence behavior in AirComp enabled federated learning, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a novel power control policy to combat against the aggregation errors, which enhanced the training accuracy and accelerated the training speed greatly.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, an energy-aware dynamic device scheduling algorithm was designed to optimize the training performance, considering both communication and computation energies of local training.
In summary, AirComp, as a nascent technology revolutionizing the traditional communication-and-computation separation method, has provided a desirable possibility of combining communication and computation together to realize a communication-efficient distributed intelligence.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.24" class="ltx_p">After being selected, these edge devices will share one public radio resource block to transmit their gradients of local model parameters simultaneously to implement AirComp.
By employing the superposition property of multiple-access channels,
the edge server will receive a weighted sum of gradient signals, which refers to the channel gains combined with power control policies.
Such an AirComp mechanism above integrates communication and computation, so as to achieve a low-latency and low-complexity data aggregation in the FEEL system.
In this work, we assume that transmissions of gradient data are strictly synchronized among all the selected devices.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Resulting from the device selection mechanism, the local data of unselected devices is not utilized sufficiently for global model updating.
This problem is not realized in most of current studies, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, in which the gradients trained by the unselected devices are directly discarded.
However, such a rough operation may result in training bias and change the direction and magnitude of the gradient, and further affect the stability and accuracy of model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, it is necessary to preserve some effective gradients of unselected devices and accumulate them to the further gradient updating, and then transmit the accumulated gradients to the server when the data and channel qualities are both satisfied.
For this purpose, we propose a dynamic residual feedback scheme, which allows devices to transmit past local gradients not transmitted to the edge server yet.
Specifically, the unselected devices preserve their current gradients locally and wait for further transmission.

In other words, the residual feedback mechanism can improve the training performance to achieve the optimal benchmark, which can be obtained when the server updates the global model using the average of all noiseless local gradients, and meet the energy requirement as well.</span></p>

However, updating local model parameters that not vary much will cause the waste and conflict of transmission resource, while with limited performance improvement of global model training. Additionally, both energy consumption of devices for transmitting their local updates and their channel conditions to the server can affect the efficiency and accuracy of model aggregation.
Therefore, it is important to design an appropriate indicator of device quality, considering the factors above, to measure their potential contributions to the model trailing in the FEEL system.

can decide the quantity of selected devices to reduce the impact of channel noise in each communication round effectively, and ensure that the quality of selected devices is as high as possible to take the full advantage of their training performances as well.
Such a scheduling mechanism can be considered as a multi-objective joint optimization problem to obtain the linear tradeoff between the maximization of device quality and minimization of the objective function in FEEL systems, which can be solved by the drift-plus-penalty algorithm in Lyapunov optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, we formulate the optimization problem of the device scheduling mechanism as

By applying the proposed mechanism, each device has an opportunity to participate the global model updating when it has a “good” quality in terms of its local update, energy consumption and channel condition.
Then the fairness of device selection can be also guaranteed to a certain extent.
In addition, the designed accumulated residual mechanism ensures
that the global training can utilize the distributed datasets fully to accelerate the convergence rate and accuracy of global training as well.

Moreover, we adopt MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, which consist of 60,000 and 50,000 labeled training data samples, respectively.
We consider both the i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. cases. Specifically, the i.i.d. dataset is assigned to the 100 edge devices randomly, and each device receives 600 examples (or 500 examples).
For the non-i.i.d. case, we first sort the data samples by digit labels and divide them into 200 shards with size 300 (or 250). Each device is allocated a disjoint subset of data with two shards equally. In other words, each device only has two labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>

while the proposed mechanism can ensure the convergence performance.
We observe that the random device selection scheme in baseline 1 has the worst performance as it does not consider any difference between devices, which results in inefficient energy consumption.
In addition, baseline 2 only adapts to the CSI, and baseline 3 considers CSI and DSI separately, both of which fail to consider the CSI and DSI jointly in the scheduling mechanism, and then results in low quality of selected devices.
Although baseline 4 exploits both the CSI and DSI jointly in its scheduling, the effect of channel fading is not well eliminated since its transmit power is fixed and unable to adapt to the changes of channel effectively.
Furthermore, the quantity of selected devices is independent of channel condition in all the baselines, which makes these baselines fail to adapt to different and changing channel noise.
In summary, the proposed device scheduling mechanism presents the best performance of test accuracy and robustness under different channel conditions compared with the baselines, and can achieve the close-to-optimal test accuracy indicated by the benchmark.

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-C Training Performance Improvements ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Gradient and Channel Aware Dynamic Scheduling for Over-the-Air Computation in Federated Edge Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, we can observe that the test accuracy and convergence rate with dynamic residual feedback scheme are both improved under the three channel conditions.
To be specific, there always exists a set of edge devices which can not participate the training process at each round due to the device selection.
Thus, the updates of unselected devices are not utilized sufficiently for global model updating, which would induce training bias and further affect the efficiency and accuracy of model training.
The dynamic residual feedback scheme can preserve the gradients of unselected devices and accumulate them for further gradient updating when the data and channel qualities are both satisfied.
Therefore, the dynamic residual feedback scheme enables the proposed mechanism to achieve higher test accuracy with faster convergence rate.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, an AirComp enabled FEEL system has been established, which achieves communication-efficient distributed learning, and data aggregation can be achieved by exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels.
Then a gradient and channel aware dynamic device scheduling mechanism was designed to select qualified edge devices to participate the local data aggregation and global model updating,
considering the data update quality, channel condition, as well as energy consumption.
In this delicately designed mechanism, a power control scheme based on channel inversion was introduced to resist the channel fading and noise, and meet the threshold requirement of received SNR. In addition, an accumulated residual feedback based gradient transmission mechanism was investigated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of global model aggregation and updating.
Moreover, to solve the device scheduling problem through a distributed and online approach, a Lyapunov-drift-minimization-based algorithm was designed.
Furthermore, this work has characterized the convergence of the proposed device scheduling mechanism in the established FEEL system.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Simulations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have validated that the proposed mechanism improved the test accuracy and convergence rate, and was robust against different channel conditions for both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. cases by comparing with different baselines.
Specifically, when the channel condition is not satisfied, a small quantity of contributive devices will be selected to upload updates with high transmit power to reduce the impact of channel distortion.
On the contrary, a large quantity of devices with low transmit power will be scheduled, which can achieve both efficient energy consumption and accurate model training.
As for future works,
it is desirable to consider multi-frequency channels
for a large-scale AirComp enabled FEEL system.
Furthermore, privacy protection and security issues are also worth investigating
and more insecure circumstances can be considered.
