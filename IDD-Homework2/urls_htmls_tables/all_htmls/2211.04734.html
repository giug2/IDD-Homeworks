<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">As the Internet grows in popularity, more and more classification jobs, such as IoT, finance industry and healthcare field, rely on mobile edge computing to advance machine learning. In the medical industry, however, good diagnostic accuracy necessitates the combination of large amounts of labeled data to train the model, which is difficult and expensive to collect and risks jeopardizing patients’ privacy. In this paper, we offer a novel medical diagnostic framework that employs a federated learning platform to ensure patient data privacy by transferring classification algorithms acquired in a labeled domain to a domain with sparse or missing labeled data. Rather than using a generative adversarial network, our framework uses a discriminative model to build multiple classification loss functions with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy. It also avoids the difficulty of collecting large amounts of labeled data or the high cost of generating large amount of sample data. Experiments on real-world image datasets demonstrates that the suggested adversarial federated transfer learning method is promising for real-world medical diagnosis applications that use image classification.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning technology has been widely applied in real life in recent years, for example, in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Health-related data, on the other hand, are existing in the form of several small datasets that are distributed around the globe due to major data privacy concerns in IoMT scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, federated learning (FL) is gaining popularity because of its capacity to provide collaborative training while maintaining data privacy, as well as a solution to the problem of isolated data islands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang Wei et al. <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. The end-to-end diagnostic framework with automatic feature extraction may be simply established when the training and testing data are from the same distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lei Yaguo et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang G et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. However, the distributions of datasets in the real-world medical diagnosis industry vary by domain. One of the most typical issues is that labels are present in some datasets but are sparse or absent in others. This disparity in data categories is likely to impair the model’s generalization capacity, resulting in differences between projected and actual results. The federated transfer learning (FTL) technique is presented as a solution to the problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Y. Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. When the datasets contribute differently, federated transfer learning can train a good model in the domain with labeled data and then apply it to the domain with sparse data labels based on the relationship between the domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To minimize the impacts of domain shift in general transfer learning, numerous techniques have applied the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Joaquin Quiñonero-Candela et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>. The deep Correlation Alignment (CORAL) approach advocated matching the mean and covariance of the two distributions with the same consideration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(M. F. I. Soumik et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.5" class="ltx_p">Adversial-based domain adaptation approaches are what these two examples are referred to as. Peng et al. proposed to use the adversarial domain adaptation technique to address the domain shift effects in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(O. Oktay et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. The core notion of adversarial training is to continuously generate and learn adversarial samples in the process of network training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goodfellow et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, the generative model’s interpretability is poor, and its distribution cannot be articulated clearly. Gradient disappearance or non-convergence occurs during training, and there is no practical, direct, or noticeable technique for evaluating the effect of the generated model. Moreover, such generative models often face the problem of high cost of generating data in the practical application of FTL.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Since the FTL framework with adversarial ideas is ideally well suited for solving the problem of domain shifts due to sparsely labeled data in real smart medical scenarios, Therefore, we present an adversarial federated transfer learning (AFTL) classifier architecture for IoMT that employs current samples directly for training and allows the model trained on labeled datasets to migrate to sparsely labeled datasets for prediction. Unlike previous methods, this adversarial model we propose does not require the generation of new samples, but only the adversarial operation on the original data, which allows the interpretation of the model results and the effective evaluation of the effects based on the resolution of the domain bias phenomenon, while avoiding the higher costs required to produce the data.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that the base of the world population is very large, the growth rate of doctors is far from that of patients. Therefore, such an AFTL framework is set up to allow patients to use their own wearable devices to learn the ability to diagnose medical images over the cloud server, so that they can use these devices to monitor their health status anytime and anywhere, breaking the limitation of distance and resources, while ensuring that their private data are not leaked. In this system, labeled datasets from the source domain, such as medical data from hospital patients, are used to jointly train a nearly perfect model under the central server. Target domain, for example, the healthcare data stored in wearable devices or mobile devices, will obtain the trained model for classification prediction. In this method, instead of coming to the hospital, people can use personal devices to get a high-accuracy medical diagnosis classifier that ignores time and distance constraints and saves both human and material resources. It safeguards the privacy of medical data while also avoiding the significant costs associated with model generation. Figure 1. depicts the entire AFTL framework.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the medical field, many fundamental tasks can be done with deep learning technology as a way to reduce the workload of doctors, improve the efficiency of consultations, and increase the accuracy of medical diagnosis.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although deep learning technology can help solve the problems of low efficiency and inaccurate results in medical diagnosis, it is difficult to collect and integrate data for training, as a large amount of treatment data of different cases of similar diseases and different conditions of the same patient are often stored in different medical institutions, and the willingness of each institution to share its own medical data is always limited. Also, personal medical data is very sensitive and involves important privacy information of users, many medical institutions do not have reasonable ways to apply and control complex medical data in the face of personal privacy protection and data security requirements.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on such considerations, federated learning is gradually gaining attention. The approach utilizes encryption algorithms to bypass the information barriers among medical institutions, and does not extract the original data of each participant, but transmits encrypted information through cryptographic protocols. This enables each medical institution to use the shared medical data for model training without exposing their original data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang, S. et al. <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>.

On the MNIST dataset whose data samples have a similar distribution, we test the suggested method for a relatively straightforward knowledge transfer, whereas the Office dataset has data samples from three different distributions aimed at sophisticated learning. Example images from all experimental datasets are provided in Figure 4. For comparison, we employed transfer learning (TL), adversarial transfer learning (ATL) and federated transfer learning (FTL) which are all sophisticated classification approaches. The performance of the AFTL method is also verified in the following experiment.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our experiment, the batch size is selected as 100 and the number of iterations is set up at 100. Figure 5.(a)(b) indicate that in the early stage of training, the accuracy is very low because the model is still unfamiliar with the sample. The accuracy of the test grows as the number of iterations increases, reaching a fixed number at the 30-th iteration and stabilizing near this figure. If the model’s expressive ability is too high, it will learn some non-common characteristics that can only satisfy the training sample, resulting in a reduction in test accuracy. Clearly, the findings of our tests did not lead to this circumstance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The cross-entropy loss is used to evaluate the model’s performance in this article’s multi-classification challenge. Figure 5.(c)(d) show how the model training improves as the number of iterations grows, and the loss function on the classifier in the test phase rapidly reduces. Near the 30-th time, it also hits the minimal value. The classification model has reached a good point at this point. As a consequence, we can say that our approach is convergent since it allows the prediction accuracy to stabilize at a high level while reducing the classification result loss.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We also set up a set of ablation experiments as a way to determine the impact of the new performance on the AFTL algorithm as shown in Table 2. and Table 3. When we remove the client discriminator on the central server, the accuracy of the test results is generally lower than that with the discriminator, indicating that the effect of our proposed client discriminator is significant as shown in Figure 6. Meanwhile, in the method without the discriminator, the accuracy of the test results increases with the increase of the sample size, while with the discriminator included, the accuracy of the test results is not significantly affected by the sample size, indicating that the proposed method is robust to the sample size, further demonstrating that the method can guarantee the training effect without the need to generate new sample data.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This article aimed to overcome the problems of data shift and privacy leakage in federated transfer learning by merging a robust neural network framework based on adversarial idea. Experiments on two separate data sets later verified that our methodology outperforms the competition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an AFTL framework for the medical diagnosis that performs adversarial operations without generating new large amounts of data, which can solve the problems of data privacy and domain shift faced by medical diagnosis scenarios, while avoiding the high cost in previous generative adversarial methods and also improving the accuracy of training results. The method proves to be experimentally superior to other methods, while the performance of our proposed new component also proves to be significantly important. The method further advances the application of AI technology in the field of medical diagnosis.</p>
