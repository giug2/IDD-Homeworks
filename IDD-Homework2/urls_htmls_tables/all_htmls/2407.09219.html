<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Clustered federated multitask learning is introduced as an effective strategy, specifically designed to tackle statistical challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed data among clients. This is achieved by clustering clients based on a similarity in their data distributions and assigning a specialized model for each cluster. However, this approach encounters complexities when applied in hierarchical wireless networks due to hierarchical two-level model aggregation and resource-based client selection. This results in a slower convergence rate and deprives clients of the best-fit specialized model for those having similar data distribution from different mobile edge networks. To this end, we propose a framework comprising two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes designed for IoT devices and intelligent vehicles. For client selection, the cloud ensures fairness among all clients by providing them with equal priority to participate in training, contributing to more accurate clustering. Once a particular cluster reaches a stopping point, the related edge server performs two client selection methods separately, greedy and round-robin. The greedy algorithm prioritizes clients with less latency and superior resources, while the round-robin algorithm allows for cyclic participation in training. The cloud then executes model aggregation in two distinct ways: one based on reaching pre-determined aggregation rounds (round-based model aggregation) and the other by performing at least one split at the edge servers (split-based model aggregation). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Our results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the convergence rate, minimize training time, and reduce energy consumption by up to 60% while providing every client with a specialized model specifically attuned to its data distribution.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, strengthened by the fifth-generation (5G) networks, has engendered a range of innovative applications such as autonomous driving and traffic prediction in intelligent vehicles, with each producing heterogeneous data in large volumes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The surge in IoT applications and the resultant increase in generated data present unprecedented opportunities for cross-application knowledge sharing, particularly within the context of hierarchical wireless networks (HWNs), enabling different IoT networks to collaborate with each other. Specifically, data communication operates on two levels – first via the edge servers and subsequently through the cloud – facilitating efficient and robust data exchange.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the vast amount of data produced by IoT edge devices, including those used in applications such as speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and traffic prediction for autonomous vehicles poses significant challenges. The traditional practice of offloading this data to the cloud for machine learning (ML) analysis proves to be resource-intensive and costly, owing to network constraints and the intrinsic heterogeneity of the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, this methodology of centralized data processing presents substantial privacy concerns, as sensitive information is often embedded within the offloaded data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, hierarchical federated learning (HFL) emerged as a promising solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where data is kept at its source, thereby preserving privacy. In contrast to the conventional FL, which consists of a two-component structure within edge networks (i.e., the central server and the edge devices), the HFL expands this configuration by incorporating more aggregation layers, forming a hierarchical structure. More specifically, the HFL is implemented in HWNs consisting of three main layers: the cloud server at the top, the edge servers in the middle, and the edge devices at the bottom. In this approach, client devices such as intelligent vehicles participate in the training process, sending only model parameters, such as weights and biases, to the edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These edge servers aggregate the received updates, create edge models, and then upload them to the cloud. The cloud then collects these edge models to update its global model, which is sent back to the clients in different edge networks for further training or future use. This iterative process continues until the global model converges, offering a promising framework for optimizing resource utilization and reducing latency while preserving privacy. Despite these advantages, the HFL faces several critical challenges, including system and statistical heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">System heterogeneity arises from the different capabilities of the clients due to variations in their hardware, storage, network connections, and power supplies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, statistical heterogeneity refers to the data being diverse, unevenly distributed, and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Communication efficiency also presents a critical challenge in HWNs, as these networks usually comprise numerous edge devices, including millions of smartphones, intelligent vehicles, and IoT devices. These devices face resource constraints such as bandwidth and energy, which can prevent effective communication within HWNs. Consequently, these challenges restrict the number of devices participating in training rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Further, the challenges extend beyond system and data heterogeneities, involving problems related to resource consumption directly associated with transmitting models to the edge server-connected cloud every round. This highlights the crucial role of appropriate client selection and model aggregation techniques that increase the convergence speed and develop an unbiased model that fits incongruent data distributions while reducing resource consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As a result, a promising approach proposed to address the above challenges, especially the unbalanced and non-IID data, is the clustered federated multitask learning (CFL) paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Unlike the standard HFL assumption that develops a shared model across clients despite variations in their data distribution, the CFL has the ability to group clients with similar data distributions into clusters and create tailored models, accurately accommodating the data patterns within each cluster. Note that the HFL assumption is violated in practical applications for two reasons  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>: first, the edge and cloud servers cannot check data owned by clients for privacy concerns, and second, the clients’ hardware capabilities inherently limit the model’s complexity. Thus, the CFL is only applied after the HFL solution reaches a stationary point (i.e., no further improvement on the HFL model using the current data) without making any adjustments to the HFL algorithm itself. Notably, the clustering process in CFL is applied to the HFL in two phases, enabling implicit knowledge sharing across the edge networks and enhancing the overall learning process. The first clustering occurs at the edge layer, where clients use HFL to train their local models and upload them to their associated edge servers. Each edge server then performs cosine similarity computations on the clients’ model gradients to decide if clustering is necessary. When partitioning is needed, each cluster develops a specialized model tailored to its data distributions. The second clustering phase takes place at the cloud layer, where edge servers upload their specialized models to the cloud. The cloud then performs similarity computations among these models to capture more patterns across the HWNs’ edge networks, effectively facilitating knowledge exchange. It is worth noting that each cluster, equipped with a specialized model, is dedicated to a specific learning task tailored to that cluster’s data distribution or application requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Several works have mainly focused on applying the CFL to edge networks, effectively tackling statistical challenges such as non-IID data distribution. For instance, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed approaches to address unbalanced and non-IID data distributions through collaborative training among clients within the same edge network. Additionally, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> introduced fairness-aware approaches, enhancing learning performance and the convergence rate by ensuring fair client selection and scheduling. They also addressed the challenges associated with struggling clients during training by reusing bandwidth in the edge wireless network. Nevertheless, none of these studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have considered collaboration among different edge networks to achieve better collaborative models. The significant challenges for these approaches stem from their inability to capture the data patterns across different edge networks, mainly because these approaches are typically implemented within a single edge network. To efficiently identify these patterns, a two-level model aggregation process is essential: one level at the edge servers to catch data patterns from diverse edge devices and a subsequent level at the cloud to capture the patterns across various mobile edge networks. This process necessitates a dual computation of similarity, executed in parallel with each model aggregation: initially at the edge servers to group clients with similar data distributions and subsequently in the cloud to provide collaborative learning across different mobile edge networks. Consequently, the issue of inter-edge network collaboration in CFL presents a critical challenge that is yet to be investigated; thus, demanding more research and exploration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these observations, we propose a new framework integrating two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes in HWNs. The framework has powerful capabilities to minimize latency and optimize resource consumption while tackling these networks’ unbalanced and non-IID data distribution. It also aims to provide collaborative training even among different mobile edge networks in HWNs to catch diverse patterns, achieving a better collaborative global model, all while considering both resource and deadline constraints by the cloud and edge servers to avoid lengthy delays before starting a new global round. To this end, we need dual model aggregation alongside two-level similarity computation. Firstly, edge servers aggregate local models and compute similarities between client gradients for clustering. Next, specialized models from different edge servers are collected and analyzed in the cloud to capture diverse patterns, enhancing collaborative learning. It is worth mentioning that the proposed approach is designed with a broad range of applications in mind, focusing more on IoT devices and intelligent vehicles as primary examples due to their urgent need for real-time data processing and efficient distributed learning. However, the strategies supporting the proposed approach can generally be applied for various applications, addressing critical challenges such as data and system heterogeneities and network resource constraints. The key contributions of this work are as follows.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL in HWNs:</span> Studying FL in HWNs has drawn considerable interest from researchers due to its ability to optimize time and resource utilization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposed the scheduling and two-level model aggregation for FL in HWNs to reduce computation and communication costs by transmitting models to the cloud via edge servers.
Also, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> suggested an adaptive HFL system that integrated edge aggregation interval control and resource allocation to minimize the combined sum of training loss and latency.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a min-max cost-optimal problem that inherently affects overall HFL performance. The authors aimed to achieve optimal results by factoring in participants’ local accuracy, subcarrier assignment, transmission power allocation, and computational resource allocation.
Besides, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> proposed a hierarchical game-theoretic framework that accurately models the dynamic, self-organizing characteristics of edge association and resource allocation within HFL. Lastly, the researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> introduced a communication-efficient training algorithm for HFL. This approach, designed to accelerate the convergence rate, employed model quantization to decrease communication overhead during model uploading. However, model quantization can significantly affect model performance and convergence rate, especially when accuracy reduces. Despite their contributions, the previously mentioned studies either ignored the challenge of statistical heterogeneity or struggled with non-IID data, mainly when dealing with highly diverse data distributions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the scheduling techniques in the literature for HFL cannot be directly applied to CFL.

<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CFL in Edge Networks:</span> CFL has recently emerged as a promising solution to tackle statistical challenges such as non-IID data distributions and restrictions in model complexity inherent to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. For instance, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> introduced a CFL framework that clusters clients with similar data distributions for joint training, leveraging the geometric characteristics of the FL loss surface. This study provided a robust mathematical justification for the effectiveness of clustering in CFL. Other studies have also proposed solutions to bandwidth limitations and energy consumption challenges in the CFL. For instance, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> introduced a flexible CFL technique that groups clients based on their optimization direction similarities and ensured scalability by adding newcomer devices to the clusters during training. Also, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a client selection and scheduling strategy that utilizes network heterogeneity to schedule clients based on their round latency to accelerate the convergence of models, satisfy fairness, and exploit the reuse of bandwidth.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite significant research on the CFL approach, the studies above primarily concentrated on applying CFL in mobile edge networks, so bridging a research gap in exploring CFL in HWNs as a more realistic network architecture is imperative. In addition, critical challenges of CFL in HWNs extend beyond system and data heterogeneities to include resource consumption issues, which arise from transmitting local models to the edge servers-connected cloud in every round. As a result, a hybrid framework incorporating client selection and model aggregation is essential for establishing an effective CFL system within HWNs.</p>

This process is repeated every global round until the global model converges to the optimal solution. It is worth noting that the participating clients aim to minimize the loss function using a local solver, i.e., a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. Specifically, each client can employ a minibatch SGD in which the batches are used to conduct several updates in a single local epoch.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The HFL assumption is violated in realistic applications due to non-IID data distributions of the clients and limitations in the model’s complexity. To avoid these challenges, CFL extends this assumption by aiming to generalize it to a group of clients with similar data distributions. This allows clients with similar data to collaborate and benefit from one another while minimizing harmful interference among clients with dissimilar data distributions. Accordingly, the following assumption for CFL is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> as follows:

stationary points for the first and second clusters, respectively. Here, stationary points refer to situations where the HFL model cannot accommodate clients’ different interests due to unbalanced and non-IID data settings. In other words, it is a final solution for the HFL objective where no further improvement is observed in the HFL model with the existing data. Upon meeting this point, splitting clients into different clusters is crucial, ensuring that each model captures more nuanced details within the data distribution in its cluster. It is worth noting that while certain specialized models may have reached their stopping points (i.e., all clients have congruent data distributions) and achieved optimal convergence, others require further training and splitting due to the greater diversity in their data distributions. Therefore, clients experience training and splitting iteratively until further splitting is impossible, where all clusters reach their stopping points and models converge to the optimal solution. It is worth mentioning that the cosine similarity, <math id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="CS" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">C</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">S</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.2">𝐶</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1.1.3">𝑆</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.8.m8.1c">CS</annotation></semantics></math>, between any two clients (i.e., <math id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.9.m9.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1a"><msup id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.10.m10.1c">n^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math>) in the <math id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.11.m11.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-<span id="S3.SS2.p3.11.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">th</span> mobile edge network within HWNs is calculated as follows:</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While the superior performance of CFL in the mobile edge networks can be achieved by including all participants in the training every round, such an approach is impractical due to two-level model aggregations as well as resource limitations in HWNs. On the other hand, using random selection will fail to capture all the incongruent data distributions among clients. Therefore, these challenges bring about the need to maintain HWN constraints while achieving the desired performance, specifically, efficient specialized models for all clusters in a hierarchical manner. Thus, ensuring the accurate splitting of clients with heterogeneous data distribution and resources is crucial in mobile edge networks. For this purpose, we seek to adjust the CFL setting by performing splitting at the initial stages of training, considering all network constraints. We aim to accelerate the convergence rate and reduce resource consumption. Thus, we need to design an ideal framework that encompasses both the two-level model aggregations and the two-phase client selection. This would enable the creation of tailored, specialized models across different mobile edge networks with minimal associated costs.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.3" class="ltx_p">For the client selection, we have a two-phase process to ensure that the resulting models capture the whole data distribution among all mobile edge networks. In the first phase of our client selection mechanism, we apply the fairness-based selection in which all active and available clients in each edge network have an equal opportunity to participate in training, contributing to more accurate clustering. In the second phase, if a given cluster reaches the stopping point as in (<a href="#S5.E27" title="Equation 27 ‣ V-A4 Fair and Round-robin Selection with Split-based Model Aggregation ‣ V-A Detailed Schemes ‣ V Proposed Solution ‣ Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>), we apply two other client selection methods based on greedy and round-robin algorithms to ensure optimized resource consumption. Adopting greedy and round-robin algorithms after clusters reach their stopping points is motivated by two key factors. First, at the stopping point, all clients within a cluster have the same data distribution; thus, selecting only one client with a better resource and less latency to represent this cluster is an optimal strategy not only to perform further training and improvement but also to reduce the training time and resource consumption significantly. Second, there is no guarantee that clients with better resources and fewer latencies will continue training at the same performance level after a certain number of rounds (i.e., they may face performance degradation); thus, alternating between clients (via round-robin selection) ensures equitable resource usage, preventing the training burden from falling on a single client.

<p id="S5.p2.4" class="ltx_p">It can be observed from (18) that applying the greedy and round-robin client selection methods only occurs for the clusters reaching the stopping point. It is worth highlighting that the proposed approach not only effectively tackles unbalanced and non-IID data but also inherently addresses system heterogeneity using two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes. In the second phase of client selection, we use greedy and round-robin algorithms for efficient scheduling based on system heterogeneity, ensuring optimal client participation. In the greedy selection, clients with less latency and better resources are prioritized for continued training, enhancing model convergence, accelerating model updates, and reducing resource consumption. Simultaneously, the round-robin algorithm ensures equitable participation by fairly distributing the training load among all clients, thus mitigating bias towards less capable clients, preventing network congestion, and enhancing bandwidth efficiency. For the two-level model aggregation, we not only minimize network traffic and transmission delays, which is beneficial for clients with limited bandwidth but also accelerate model updates through local aggregation at edge servers. This approach ensures efficient training and swift decision-making, which is crucial for real-time applications, such as IoT devices and intelligent vehicles.</p>

In the worst case of CFL, it is always correct to partition clients into two clusters if the separation gap between the two types of similarities is greater than zero. Otherwise, there is no need for splitting. Thus, the separation gap can be defined as:</p>

To measure the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we carry out a series of simulations using the FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. These datasets are widely used for handwriting classification and object recognition tasks, respectively, in the FL setting. Specifically, the CIFAR-10 dataset can be used in autonomous vehicles, where image recognition and interpretation are crucial for safe and efficient operation. FEMNIST explicitly helps classify letters and digits (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9), comprising 244,154 images for training and 61,500 for testing, while CIFAR-10 comprises 60,000 32x32 colored images. Also, we apply these datasets in a non-IID fashion, partitioning them into <math id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{J}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1.1.cmml">𝒥</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1b"><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1.1">𝒥</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.15.m15.1c">\mathcal{J}</annotation></semantics></math> fragments and restricting each client to hold only two random classes. Regarding the model architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is employed for FEMNIST, which is integrated with two hidden layers, while Alexnet, a deep neural network (DNN), is utilized for CIFAR-10. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied to the hidden layers in both learning tasks, while the output layer utilizes the Softmax activation function.

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We further demonstrate the robustness of our proposed approach against baselines in terms of accurate clustering and splitting process using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Specifically, we pick the scenario of fair and greedy selection with split-based model aggregation as an example of the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the baselines. As illustrated in Figs. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Fig. 8 ‣ VI-A Experimental Setup ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F6" title="Fig. 6 ‣ VI-A Experimental Setup ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, our proposed scenario outperforms the baselines, both in terms of clustering rate and convergence rate. The improved performance stems from our approach’s novel strategies (i.e., two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation), which enable more accurate client clustering and faster convergence rates. Initially, we permit all available clients to participate in the training. Subsequently, once a specific cluster approaches its stopping point, we invoke an efficient scheduling technique. By leveraging a greedy selection algorithm, clients characterized by lower latency and better resources are selected for continued training. In contrast, the baselines’ performance declines due to its random client selection (i.e., no consideration for data distribution or resource availability). This non-strategic approach complicates the training process, leading to extended training time.</p>

This is because the model aggregation occurs every five or ten rounds during the learning process, leading to reduced communication rounds frequency between the cloud and edge servers and thus saving energy consumption. Moreover, a significant reduction in energy consumption is achieved when the greedy selection algorithm is used. This is because clients with lower latency and better resources are prioritized in training, thus reducing energy costs.

This superior performance in energy consumption can be attributed to two key factors: First, our scheduling technique selects clients based on model performance (i.e., greedy selection) or fairness on resource distribution (i.e., round-robin selection). Second, the split is only performed when conditions (<a href="#S3.E5" title="Equation 5 ‣ III-B Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) ‣ III SYSTEM MODEL ‣ Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) and (<a href="#S3.E6" title="Equation 6 ‣ III-B Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) ‣ III SYSTEM MODEL ‣ Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) are met during training, which triggers model aggregation in the cloud.

This significant reduction can be attributed to our scheduling technique and model aggregation schemes that we employ in HWNs. In particular, once a cluster reaches the stopping point, the proposed approach uses a greedy selection where clients exhibiting less latency and better resources are selected for further training. In addition, the proposed approach leverages split-based model aggregation, activating model aggregation only when one split is performed on the edge servers. In general, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in averaged energy consumption across different datasets (i.e., FEMNIST and CIFAR-10). This emphasizes the robustness and flexibility of the proposed approach within HWNs.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work introduced a novel framework comprising two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation for CFL in HWN. Our proposed approach reduced the training time and resource consumption while ensuring satisfactory client accuracy and accelerating the convergence rate. It also ensured fairness among clients by offering them equal opportunities to participate in the training and designing a tailored model for each client. We formulated an optimization problem to identify optimal client selection and model aggregation schemes. This process enables the HWNs to minimize training costs and enhance the speed of convergence in the presence of unbalanced and non-IID data distribution and the diversity of clients. We conducted comprehensive simulation experiments using realistic federated datasets (FEMNIST and CIFAR-10).
The numerical results showed the superior performance of our proposed approach over baseline techniques in terms of computation and communication time, convergence speed, and resource consumption, all while providing satisfactory performance. In our future works, we aim to explore learning in dynamic environments where data is non-static and continually evolving.</p>
