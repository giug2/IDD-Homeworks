<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based federated learning (FL) enables low-latency uploads and the aggregation of machine learning models by exploiting simultaneous co-channel transmission and the resultant waveform superposition.
This study aims at realizing secure AirComp-based FL against various privacy attacks where malicious central servers infer clients’ private data from aggregated global models.
To this end, a differentially private AirComp-based FL is designed in this study, where the key idea is to harness receiver noise perturbation injected to aggregated global models inherently, thereby preventing the inference of clients’ private data.
However, the variance of the inherent receiver noise is often uncontrollable, which renders the process of injecting an appropriate noise perturbation to achieve a desired privacy level quite challenging.
Hence, this study designs transmit power control across clients, wherein the received signal level is adjusted intentionally to control the noise perturbation levels effectively, thereby achieving the desired privacy level.
It is observed that a higher privacy level requires lower transmit power, which indicates the tradeoff between the privacy level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
To understand this tradeoff more fully, the closed-form expressions of SNR (with respect to the privacy level) are derived, and the tradeoff is analytically demonstrated.
The analytical results also demonstrate that among the configurable parameters, the number of participating clients is a key parameter that enhances the received SNR under the aforementioned tradeoff.
The analytical results are validated through numerical evaluations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To perform intelligent big-data analysis driven using client-generated data from mobile devices while preserving the privacy of the clients, federated learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has attracted considerable attention.
FL is a distributed machine-learning (ML) technique that enables clients to learn a shared ML model collaboratively while keeping their local data on their devices.
Specifically, each client trains an ML model locally and uploads the model parameters instead of uploading their local data to a central server.
The central server aggregates the model parameters and forms a global model.
In FL, clients are not required to expose their private data to the central servers, which is beneficial in terms of client privacy.
This is unlike conventional MLs that acquire and store the training data in central servers, wherein clients’ private data can be exposed to the central servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite these promising benefits, FL involves the following two challenges:
First, uploading model parameters requires connectivity of many clients via wireless multiple-access channel with limited radio resources, resulting in considerable upload latencies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Second, despite preventing the exposure of clients’ private data, FL still faces the risk of privacy leakage.
This happens because the model parameters uploaded by clients may still be informative<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and the clients’ private data may be inferred by malicious central servers from the aggregated global model parameters<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
These challenges call for the design of low-latency multiple-access schemes that also preserve privacy of clients in the sense that client private data cannot be inferred by such inference attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the first issue of upload latency over wireless multiple-access channels, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
AirComp typically computes the desired functions by exploiting the wireless superposition nature yielded from the simultaneous transmission of analog-modulated signals.
This simultaneous transmission leads to dramatic latency reduction when compared to the conventional orthogonal access techniques.
In the FL context, the aggregation of model parameters transmitted by clients can be performed using AirComp.
Typically, these existing studies aim at minimizing the noise perturbation injected to the computation results of global model parameters.
For example, this goal can be achieved by enhancing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using user scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the desired computation results and received symbols through transmit power control<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, analog beamforming<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, or phase shifting by reflecting surfaces<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, the minimization of noise perturbation and the consequent accurate estimation of the desired computation results still include risks from the aforementioned inference attacks performed by malicious central servers in base stations (BSs) or access points in the AirComp-based FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these two challenges jointly, we aim to design an AirComp-based FL that is secure against the aforementioned inference attacks.
This goal is achieved by harnessing the perturbation from the inherent receiver noises, instead of minimizing the noise perturbations, thereby preserving differential privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
In a nutshell, differential privacy is a privacy notion quantified by the difference in possible outcomes of data aggregations (e.g., calculating an arithmetic mean) performed with or without each individual’s data.
The smaller difference indicates that each individual’s contribution is smaller, which makes it harder for adversaries to infer data of each individual.
Hence, the smaller difference is interpreted as a higher privacy level.
In the FL context, designing a differentially private model aggregation with a higher privacy level makes it harder for malicious model aggregators to infer clients local models, resulting in the privacy protection from the aforementioned inference attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Recent studies designed a differentially private FL in non-AirComp by injecting artificial noises to aggregated global model parameters.
However, unlike these studies, our objective is to design an AirComp-based FL that preserves differential privacy by using the inherent receiver noises.
Therein, the differential privacy level depends on the configurable wireless parameters, e.g., transmit powers, and hence, designing such parameters is necessary, which is an essential difference from designing differential private FL in non-AirComp.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design AirComp-based FL that achieves data security against the aforementioned privacy inference attacks, based on the following two ideas.
The first idea is preserving a higher level of differential privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> by harnessing the perturbation from receiver noises inherently injected into aggregated global models.
However, utilizing receiver noises poses the challenge of injecting an appropriate noise perturbation level to achieve a desired privacy level, because the variance of receiver noises is often uncontrollable.
Motivated by this, the second idea is to intentionally adjust the received signal level by controlling the transmit powers, thereby controlling the perturbation levels effectively so that the desired privacy level is achieved.
Through numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the designed transmit power control achieves a higher privacy level compared to a conventional power control<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> while exhibiting comparable training performance.</p>

We can see that, as the number of clients increases, the received SNR increases, along with the analytical SNR bound in (<a href="#S4.Ex2" title="Remark 1. ‣ IV Analysis of Tradeoff between SNR and Privacy Level ‣ Differentially Private AirComp Federated Learning with Power Adaptation Harnessing Receiver Noise" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
When compared to the increase in the number of clients, the increase in the maximum transmit power does not have an impact on the received SNR.
These facts validate our statement: for a higher target privacy level, the number of clients is a key factor that enhances the received SNR.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We designed AirComp-based FL preserving differential privacy with a desired privacy level to protect local data of clients against privacy inference attacks.
To this end, we considered the use of inherent receiver noises and designed transmit power control to control the level of noise perturbation to the aggregated global model, ensuring a desired privacy level could be achieved.
To gain insight into the challenges to achieve a higher privacy level, we derived a closed-form expression of SNR w.r.t. the privacy level and quantified the tradeoff between these two metrics.
Moreover, the analytical results demonstrate that the number of participating clients is the major factor to enhance the SNR under the tradeoff in particular when a higher privacy level is desired.
These analytical results were verified through numerical evaluations.
The evaluation results also demonstrated the feasibility of the designed power control achieving a performance comparable to that of a conventional power control while achieving a higher differential privacy level.</p>
