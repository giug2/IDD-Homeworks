<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">A key solution to visual question answering (VQA) exists in how to fuse visual and language features extracted from an input image and question. We show that
an attention mechanism that enables dense, bi-directional interactions between the two modalities
contributes to boost accuracy of prediction of answers. Specifically, we present a simple architecture that is fully symmetric between visual and language representations, in which each question word attends on image regions and each image region attends on question words. It can be stacked to form a hierarchy for multi-step interactions between an image-question pair.
We show through experiments that the proposed architecture achieves a new state-of-the-art on VQA and VQA 2.0 despite its small size. We also present qualitative evaluation, demonstrating how the proposed attention mechanism can generate reasonable attention maps on images and questions, which leads to the correct answer prediction.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a significant progress in the study of visual question answering (VQA) over a short period of time since its introduction, showing rapid boost of performance for common benchmark datasets. This progress has been mainly brought about by two lines of research,
the development of better attention mechanisms and the improvement in fusion of features extracted from an input image and question.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since introduced by Bahdanau et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, attention has been playing an important role in solutions of various problems of artificial intelligence ranging from tasks using single modality (e.g., language, speech, and vision) to multimodal tasks. For VQA, attention on image regions generated from the input question was first introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and then several extensions have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#biba.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#biba.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, researchers have proposed several methods for feature fusion
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#biba.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#biba.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>,
where the aim is to obtain better fused representation of image and question pairs. These studies updated the state-of-the-art for common benchmark datasets at the time of each publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We observe that these two lines of research have been independently conducted so far. This is particularly the case with the studies of feature fusion methods, where attention is considered to be optional, even though the best performance is achieved with it. However, we think that they are rather <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">two different approaches towards the same goal</span>. In particular, we argue that a better attention mechanism leads to a better fused representation of image-question pairs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by this, we propose a novel co-attention mechanism for improved fusion of visual and language representations. Given representations of an image and a question, it first generates an attention map on image regions for each question word and an attention map on question words for each image region.
It then performs computation of attended features, concatenation of multimodal representations, and their transformation by a single layer network with ReLU and a residual connection.
These computations are encapsulated into a composite network that we call <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dense co-attention</span> layer, since it considers every interaction between any image region and any question word. The layer has fully symmetric architecture between the two modalities, and can be stacked to form a hierarchy that enables multi-step interactions between the image-question pair.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Starting from initial representations of an input image and question, each dense co-attention layer in the layer stack updates the representations, which are inputted to the next layer. Its final output are then fed to a layer for answer prediction. We use additional attention mechanisms in the initial feature extraction as well as the answer prediction layer. We call the entire network including all these components the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dense coattention network</span> (DCN). We show the effectiveness of DCNs by several experimental results; they achieve the new state-of-the-art for VQA 1.0 and 2.0 datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Attention has proved its effectiveness on many tasks and VQA is no exception. A number of methods have been developed so far, in which question-guided attention on image regions is commonly used. They are categorized into two classes according to the type of employed image features. One is the class of methods that use visual features from some region proposals, which are generated by Edge Boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#biba.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or Region Proposal Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
The other is the class of methods that use convolutional features (i.e., activations of convolutional layers) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#biba.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#biba.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#biba.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#biba.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#biba.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#biba.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#biba.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#biba.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#biba.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#biba.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are several approaches to creation and use of attention maps. Yang <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> developed stacked attention network that produces multiple attention maps on the image in a sequential manner, aiming at performing multiple steps of reasoning.

that can encode cross-region relation, aiming at properly answering questions that involve complex inter-region relations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Earlier studies mainly considered question-guided attention on image regions. In later studies, the opposite orientation of attention, i.e., image-guided attention on question words, is considered additionally.

To reduce the gap of image and question features, Yu <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> utilized attention to extract not only spatial information but also language concept of the image.
Yu <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> combined the mechanism with a novel multi-modal feature fusion of image and question.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We point out that the existing attention mechanisms only consider a limited amount of possible interactions between image regions and question words. Some consider only attention on image regions from a <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whole</span> question. Co-attention additionally considers attention on question words but it is created from a <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whole</span> image. We argue that this can be a significant limitation of the existing approaches. The proposed mechanism can deal with every interaction between any image region and any question word, which possibly enables to model unknown complex image-question relations that are necessary for correctly answering questions.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Multimodal Feature Fusion</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The common framework of existing methods is that visual and language features are independently extracted from the image and question at the initial step, and they are fused at a later step to compute the final prediction.
In early studies, researchers employed simple fusion methods such as the concatenation, summation, and element-wise product of the visual and language features, which are fed to fully connected layers to predict answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It was then shown by Fukui <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> that a more complicated fusion method does improve prediction accuracy; they introduced the bilinear (pooling) method that uses an outer product of two vectors of visual and language features for their fusion. As the outer product gives a very high-dimensional feature, they adopt the idea of Gao <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to compress the fused feature and name it the Multimodal Compact Bilinear (MCB) pooling method.
However, the compacted feature of the MCB method still tends to be high-dimensional to guarantee robust performance, Kim <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed low-rank bilinear pooling using Hadamard product of two feature vectors, which is called the Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear (MLB) pooling. Pointing out that MLB suffers from slow convergence rate, Yu <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed the Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling, which computes a fused feature with a matrix factorization trick to reduce the number of parameters and improve convergence rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The attention mechanisms can also be considered feature fusion methods, regardless of whether it is explicitly mentioned, since they are designed to obtain a better representation of image-question pairs based on their interactions. This is particularly the case with co-attention mechanisms in which the two features are treated symmetrically.
Our dense co-attention network is based on this observation. It fuses the two features by multiple applications of the attention mechanism that can use more fine-grained interactions between them.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As in many previous studies, we use a pretrained CNN (i.e., a ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> with 152 layers pretrained on
ImageNet) to extract visual features of multiple image regions, but
our extraction method is slightly different. We extract features from four conv. layers and then use a question-guided attention on these layers to fuse their features. We do this to exploit the maximum potential of the subsequent dense co-attention layers. We conjecture that features at different levels in the hierarchy of visual representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#biba.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> will be necessary to correctly answer a wide range of questions.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, features are first linearly projected to multiple lower-dimensional spaces, for each of which the above attention function is performed.

All the questions are categorized into three types: yes/no, number, and other. Each question has 10 free-response answers. VQA 2.0 is an updated version of VQA 1.0 and is the largest as of now. Compared with VQA 1.0, it contains more samples (443,757 <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">train</span>, 214,354 <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">val</span>, and 447,793 <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">test</span> questions), and is more balanced in term of language bias.
We evaluate our models on the challenging Open-Ended task of both datasets.</p>

the answer prediction layer. A typical example is shown in Fig.<a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Improved Fusion of Visual and Language Representations by Dense Symmetric Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Each row shows the results for two pairs of the same question and different images, from which we can observe that the DCN is able to look at right regions to find the correct answers. Then, the first column shows the results for two pairs of the same image and different questions. It is observed that the DCN focuses on relevant image regions and question words to produce answers correctly.
More visualization results including failure cases are provided in the supplementary material.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel network architecture for VQA named the dense co-attention network.
The core of the network is the dense co-attention layer, which is designed to enable improved fusion of visual and language representations by considering dense symmetric interactions between the input image and question. The layer can be stacked to perform multi-step image-question interactions. The layer stack combined with the initial feature extraction step and the final answer prediction layer, both of which have their own attention mechanisms, form the dense co-attention network. The experimental results on two datasets, VQA and VQA 2.0, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</p>

pretrained RNNs (specifically, GRU networks pre-trained with Skip-thought) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In this study, we initially pursued a similar approach; we perform fine-tuning of a pretrained LSTM, specifically a two-layer Bi-LSTM trained as a CoVe (Context Vector) encoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Conducting comparative experiments, we eventually employ a single-layer Bi-LSTM with random initialization, as explained in the main paper. We report here the results of the experiments.</p>

Note that the former is a two-layer model and the later has only one layer. Here, the VQA 2.0 test-dev dataset was used. It is observed that for DCNs with the answer prediction layer of (16), the one with the CoVe-pretrained model performs slightly better than the one with the randomly initialized model, but their differences are small. For DCNs with the answer prediction layers of (17) and (18), the one with the randomly initialized model performs better with a less number of parameters.</p>

<p id="A3.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the DCN is able to locate appropriate image regions and words, it fails to distinguish two different objects or concepts that have similar appearance. This may be attributable to that the extracted image features are not rich enough to distinguish them

<p id="A3.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the DCN is able to locate appropriate image regions and words, it fails to yield correct answers due to the bias of the dataset or missing instances of some objects/concepts in the dataset.

Layer Attention in the Image Feature Extraction Step
</h2>

<div id="A4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As explained in the main paper (Sec.3.1), our DCN extracts visual features from an input image using a pre-trained ResNet at the initial step. The features are obtained by computing the weighted sum of the activations (i.e., outputs) of the four convolutional layers of the ResNet, where the attention weights generated conditioned on the input question are used. We examine here how this attention mechanism works for different types of questions. Specifically, utilizing the fifty five question types provided in the VQA-2.0, we compute the mean and standard deviation of the four attention weights for the questions belonging to each question type. We used all the questions in the validation set and our DCN trained only on train set for this computation.</p>

The bars in four colors represent the means of the four layer weights for each question type, and the thin black bars attached to the color bars represent their standard deviations.
