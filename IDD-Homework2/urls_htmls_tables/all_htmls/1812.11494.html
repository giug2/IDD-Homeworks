<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">To leverage rich data distributed at the network edge, a new machine-learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged where learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing intelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, <em id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated “over-the-air” by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such <em id="id1.id1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">broadband analog aggregation</em> (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control (“truncated channel inversion”) required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive <em id="id1.id1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">signal-to-noise ratio</em> (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rises to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning. Next, the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA with respect to the traditional OFDMA scheme is proved to scale almost linearly with the device population. Experiments based on a neural network and a real dataset are conducted for corroborating the theoretical results. In addition, we discuss the extensions of BAA to acquire safety against adversary attacks and integrate beamforming for enhancing cell-edge links.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The traffic in mobile Internet is growing at a breath-taking rate due to the extreme popularity of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and sensors). Analysis shows that there will be 80 billions of devices connected to Internet by 2025, resulting in a tenfold traffic growth compared with 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The availability of enormous mobile data and recent breakthroughs in <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">artificial intelligence</em> (AI) motivate researchers to develop AI technologies at the network edge. Such technologies are collectively called <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge AI</em> and drive the latest trend in machine learning, i.e., <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge learning</em>, that concerns training of edge-AI models via computation at edge servers and devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The migration of learning from central clouds towards the edge allows edge servers to have fast access to real-time data generated by edge devices for fast training of AI models. In return, downloading the models from servers to devices in proximity provision the latter intelligence to respond to real-time events. While computing speeds are growing rapidly, wireless transmission of high-dimensional data by many devices suffers from the scarcity of radio resources and hostility of wireless channels, resulting in a communication bottleneck for fast edge learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
This calls for the design of low-latency multi-access schemes that integrate techniques from two different areas, namely distributed learning and wireless communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose one such scheme, called <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">broadband analog aggregation</em> (BAA), for low-latency implementation of a popular distributed-learning framework, called <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, in a wireless network, referred to as <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEEL). As illustrated in Fig <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a key operation of FEEL is to aggregate (or average) local models trained on devices to update the global model at a server. The BAA realizes the operation over a broadband multi-access channel by exploiting simultaneous transmission and the resultant waveform superposition. This leads to dramatic latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access. In this work, we develop the BAA framework by deriving the tradeoffs between a set of communication-and-learning metrics and quantifying the latency reduction compared with the conventional design.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned, FEEL is a recently developed distributed-learning framework that preserves user-privacy by avoiding direct data uploading. To this end, a typical federated-learning algorithm alternates between two phases, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. One is to aggregate distributed updates over a multi-access channel and apply their average to update the AI-model at the edge server. The other is to broadcast the model under training to allow edge devices to compute its updates using local datasets and then transmit
the updates to the server for aggregation. The iteration continues until the global model converges and each iteration is called a <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication round</em>. The updates computed locally at edge devices can be either the model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or gradient vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, giving rise to two implementation approaches, i.e., <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model-averaging</em> and <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">gradient-averaging</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In view of high dimensionality in updates (each constitutes e.g., millions of parameters), a main theme in the FEEL research is to develop communication-efficient strategies for fast update-uploading to accelerate learning.
There exist three main approaches. The first addresses the <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">straggler issue</em>, namely that the slow devices (stragglers) dominate the overall latency due to update synchronization required for aggregation. To reduce latency, a partial averaging scheme is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> where only a portion of updates from those fast-responding devices are used for global model updating, while those from stragglers are discarded. Later, the design was enhanced by coding the updates such that the full update-averaging can be still realized using only a portion of coded updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The second approach also aims at reducing the number of transmitting devices, but the scheduling criterion is update significance instead of computation speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
If FEEL is implemented based on model averaging, the update significance is measured by the <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model variance</em> which indicates the divergence of a particular local model from the average across all local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, if the gradient averaging is employed, the update significance is measured by <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">gradient divergence</em> that reflects the level of change on the current gradient update w.r.t. the previous one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The last approach focuses on update compression by exploiting the sparsity of gradient updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The prior work by computer scientists focuses on reducing the number of updating devices and compressing the information for transmission. It represents a computer-science approach for tackling the communication-latency problem in the FEEL systems.
Wireless channels therein are abstracted as “bit pipes” that overlook the possibility of exploiting the channels’ sophisticated properties (e.g., fading, multi-access and broadcasting, and spatial multiplexing) for latency reduction. Thus, a more direct and perhaps more fundamental approach for solving this communication problem is to develop wireless communication techniques to support low-latency FEEL.
We adopt the new approach in this work and focus on designing a multi-access scheme for communication-efficient FEEL. The classic orthogonal-access schemes (e.g., OFDMA or TDMA) have been designed for supporting independent links. Their applications to edge learning can cause the multi-access latency to scale linearly with the number of edge devices and thus are inefficient. To overcome the drawback, we propose the low-latency BAA scheme for leveraging simultaneous broadband transmission to implement update aggregation “over-the-air” in the FEEL systems.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The current BAA scheme builds on the classic idea of over-the-air computation (AirComp).
The idea of AirComp can be traced back to the pioneering work studying functional computation in sensor networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The design relies on structured codes (i.e., lattice codes) to cope with channel distortion introduced by the multi-access channel. The significance of the work lies in its counter-intuitive finding that “interference” can be harnessed to help computing. It was subsequently discovered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> that simple analog transmission without coding but with channel pre-equalization can achieve the minimum distortion if the data sources are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian.
Nevertheless, coding can be still useful for other settings if the sources follow more complex distributions such as bivariate Gaussian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and correlated Gaussian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The satisfactory performance and simplicity of analog AirComp has led to an active area focusing on robustness design and performance analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In particular, techniques for distributed power control and robust AirComp against channel estimation errors are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, respectively. Theoretical analysis on the AirComp outage performance under a distortion constraint and the computation rate, defined as the number of functional values computed per time slot, were provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, respectively. Another vein of research focuses on transforming AirComp from theory into practice by prototyping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and addressing the practical issue of transmission synchronization over sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed to modulate the data into transmit power to relax the synchronization requirement. As a result, only coarse block-synchronization is required for realizing AirComp. An alternative scheme, called <em id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">AirShare</em>, is developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> which broadcasts a shared clock to all devices so as to enforce synchronization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Advancing beyond scalar-valued function computation, the latest trend in the area also explores multiple-input-mutiple-output (MIMO) techniques to enable vector-valued function computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, referred as MIMO AirComp. In particular, a comprehensive framework for MIMO AirComp that consists of beamforming optimization and a matching limited-feedback design is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The framework was extended in subsequent work to wirelessly-powered AirComp system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, where the beamformer was jointly optimized with the wireless power control to further reduce the AirComp distortion, and massive MIMO AirComp system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where a reduced-dimension two-tier beamformer design was developed by exploiting the clustered channel structure to reduce the channel-feedback overhead and signal processing complexity. It is also worth mentioning that, while AirComp is mostly deployed in computation-centric sensor networks as discussed above, the AirComp operation has been also leveraged in rate-maximization cellular systems such as two-way relaying <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and MIMO lattice decoding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Prior work on AirComp targets sensor networks and thus focuses on narrow-band systems only. The reason is that sensor networks typically require low-rate transmission and communicate over a dedicated narrow-band in practical systems, e.g., LTE for narrow-band Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. In contrast, we consider broadband channels due to the transmission of high-dimensional updates in the FEEL systems. However, the solutions for broadband AirComp do not exist in the existing literature. Such design as well as the study of the effects of AirComp on the edge-learning performance is an area largely uncharted. This motivates the development of the BAA scheme and its performance analysis in the current work.</p>

The tradeoff also shows that the receive SNR is limited by the path-loss of the furthest device from the server, which is due to the said amplitude alignment among devices. This suggests that the receive SNR can be improved via scheduling cell-interior devices for FEEL. However, this causes data loss and thereby gives rise to the second tradeoff, namely the one between the receive SNR and the fraction of exploited data. It is referred to as <em id="S1.I2.i1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">(update)-reliability-(data)-quantity tradeoff</em>. The above two tradeoffs are fundamental for FEEL systems with BAA and can be useful tools for further research in this direction. In addition, to improve this tradeoff by copying with data deficiency, we propose two scheduling schemes: one is to exploit mobility and the other to alternate the scheduling of cell-interior and cell-edge devices.</p>

Nevertheless, the specific systems and designs therein differ from the current work. Both paralelled work targets narrow-band single/multi-antenna channels and focuses on algorithmic design to improve system performance. Specifically, a source-coding algorithm that exploits the sparsity in gradient update is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> for compressed update transmission.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enable BAA, the transmitter design for edge devices is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ III-A1 Transmitter Design ‣ III-A The Scheme of Broadband Analog Aggregation ‣ III Broadband Analog Aggregation: Scheme and Properties ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>. Essentially, the design differs from the classic OFDM transmitter by replacing digital modulation (e.g., QAM) with linear analog modulation and adding channel-inversion power control, as highlighted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ III-A1 Transmitter Design ‣ III-A The Scheme of Broadband Analog Aggregation ‣ III Broadband Analog Aggregation: Scheme and Properties ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">The new signal-processing operations in the transmitter are described as follows. The local-model parameters are first amplitude-modulated into symbols. The long symbol sequence is divided into blocks. Each is transmitted in a single OFDM symbol with one parameter over one frequency sub-channel. Assuming perfect CSI at the transmitter, sub-channels are inverted by power control so that model parameters transmitted by different devices are received with identical amplitudes, achieving amplitude alignment at the receiver as required for BAA. Nevertheless, a brute-force approach is inefficient if not impossible under a power constraint since some sub-channels are likely to encounter deep fades. To overcome the issue, we adopt the more practical <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">truncated channel inversion</em>.

Since both affect the receive-update quality at the server, the threshold being too high or too low degrades the learning performance. Thus it is necessary to optimize the threshold, which is a design issue warranting further investigation. In experiments, the power-cutoff threshold is optimized numerically to optimize the learning performance by a grid search.

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Consider the scenario where edge devices have high mobility and their locations change rapidly over time. In this scenario, the cell-interior scheduling is also known as <em id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">opportunistic scheduling</em>. Given high mobility, the scheme can automatically cope with the data deficiency since an cell-edge device can enter the cell-interior in a subsequent communication round and be scheduled.
By assuming the locations of all devices are i.i.d. over communication rounds, we can quantify this fact as follows.</p>

In particular, alternating scheme can exploit all data for learning while achieving an effective receive SNR averaging those of the two sub-schemes. The alternating frequency between the two modes could be optimized to balance the reliability-quantity tradeoff for improving learning performance. As a result, the alternating scheduling can outperform both the cell-interior and all-inclusive schedulings.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key advantage of the proposed BBA w.r.t. the conventional digital OFDMA is the significant reduction in communication latency. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V Latency Analysis: Broadband Analog Aggregation v.s. Broadband Digital Aggregation ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the fundamental reason for the latency reduction is the difference in how the two schemes allocate the spectrum to devices. BAA allows the complete reuse of the whole bandwidth to exploit “interference” for direct aggregation. OFDMA orthogonalizes the bandwidth allocation to avoid interference for offering reliable communication.
As a result, the bandwidth per device reduces with the number of devices.
In this section, we analyze the latency reduction of BAA w.r.t. OFDMA.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">In order to derive the model updating latency, the transmission rate of the system is needed.
To this end, we consider the practical adaptive QAM modulation scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
It is well known that the optimal power control for such a scheme follows “water-filling” over channel realizations. The resultant transmission rate has no closed-form, making latency analysis intractable. The difficulty can be overcome by considering the sub-optimal power control, truncated channel inversion in (<a href="#S3.E11" title="In III-A1 Transmitter Design ‣ III-A The Scheme of Broadband Analog Aggregation ‣ III Broadband Analog Aggregation: Scheme and Properties ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>).

As shown at Fig. <a href="#S6.F10.sf1" title="In Figure 10 ‣ VI-C Performance Comparison between Different Scheduling Schemes ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10(a)</span></a>, although BAA is expected to be more vulnerable to channel noise, it is interesting to see that the two schemes are comparable in learning accuracy (for both the IID and non-IID settings). Such accurate learning of BAA is partly due to the high expressiveness of the deep neural network which makes the learnt model robust against perturbation by channel noise. The result has a profound and refreshing implication that reliable communication may not be the primary concern in edge learning. Essentially, BAA exploits this relaxation on communication reliability to trade for a low communication latency as shown at Fig. <a href="#S6.F10.sf2" title="In Figure 10 ‣ VI-C Performance Comparison between Different Scheduling Schemes ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning (Extended Version)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10(b)</span></a>. The latency gap between the two schemes is remarkable. Without compromising the learning accuracy, BAA can achieve a significant latency reduction ranging from 10x to 1000x. In general, the superiority in latency of BAA over OFDMA is more pronounced in the low SNR regime and dense-network scenarios.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One practical issue to be concerned in the federated edge learning is the vulnerability to the adversarial attack by some hostile users who purposely upload inaccurate model-updates or random noise during the model aggregation.

In general, aggregation-beamforming can form sharper and stronger beams towards the targeted cell-edge users as the full DoFs are used for SNR enhancement. On the contrary, the beams formed by SDMA towards the intended users tend to be flatter and weaker as the interference nulling constraints consume part of the DoFs, leaving only a fraction of DoFs for SNR enhancement. Furthermore, users near to each other may cause the differentiability issue in SDMA, due to a finite spatial resolution. This, however, is irrelevant to aggregation-beamforming as no discrimination between users is required. </em><span id="ThmRemark4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"></span></p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">In this paper, we have presented the framework of BAA for low-latency FEEL. The design exploits
the wave-from superposition property of a multi-access channel for communication-efficient update aggregation.
The significance of the work lies in the finding of two communication-and-learning tradeoffs, namely the </span><em id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">SNR-truncation tradeoff</em><span id="S8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold"> resulting from the amplitude alignment required for aggregation, and the </span><em id="S8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">reliabilty-quantity tradeoff</em><span id="S8.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold"> due to the scheduling of cell-interior devices for constraining path loss. The tradeoffs are fundamental for FEEL network with BAA and can provide useful guidelines for network planning and optimization. Besides the findings in tradeoffs, we also prove that the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA w.r.t. the traditional OFDMA scheme scale almost linearly with the device population, justifying the claimed low-latency property.</span></p>

<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">At a higher lever, the current work represents an initial but important steps towards the fusion of communication and computation/learning. It opens several directions for further investigation. One direction is to further enhance the
aggregation performance of BAA by exploiting the clustering structure in device distribution for scheduling. Another interesting direction is to integrate the BAA design with the sparsity-induced update-compression techniques for further reducing the communication overhead. Last, robust BAA against the synchronization error is also an important topic to be addressed.</span></p>
