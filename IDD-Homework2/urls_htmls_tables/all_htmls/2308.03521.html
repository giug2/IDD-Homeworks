<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, federated learning (FL) has been widely considered for application in wireless networks for distributed model training. <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">However, data heterogeneity, e.g., non-independently identically distributions and different sizes of training data among clients, poses major challenges to wireless FL. Limited communication resources complicate the implementation of fair scheduling which is required for training on heterogeneous data, and further deteriorate the overall performance. <span id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> To address this issue, this paper focuses on performance analysis and optimization for wireless FL, considering data heterogeneity, combined with wireless resource allocation. Specifically, we first develop a closed-form expression for an upper bound on the FL loss function, with a particular emphasis on data heterogeneity described by a dataset size vector and a data divergence vector. Then we formulate the loss function minimization problem, under constraints on long-term energy consumption and latency, and jointly optimize <span id="id1.id1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>lient scheduling, <span id="id1.id1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">r</span>esource allocation, and the number of local training <span id="id1.id1.1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">e</span>pochs (CRE). Next, via the Lyapunov drift technique, we transform the CRE optimization problem into a series of tractable problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of the learning accuracy and energy consumption.</span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The modern era of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed powerful capabilities brought by machine learning (ML) in many applications, such as computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and so on. However, conventional ML algorithms require a centralized server to collect data from distributively located devices, consuming large amounts of communication resources. Also, privacy issues in the conventional ML are of growing concern, since data transmitted from the end devices may be eavesdropped upon during transmissions. To address these challenges, federated learning (FL), as a novel distributed learning paradigm, has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, in which a model is learned iteratively via local training on end devices and global aggregation on a server. Compared with centralized ML, FL has the advantages of reducing the communication burden by only transmitting models rather than raw data, balancing computational overload between the server and end devices for model training, and promoting privacy of clients by keeping data locally. In addition, FL can be incorporated with other advanced techniques, such as blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, for enhancing its security.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) at unprecedented scales, mobile devices equipped with powerful hardware are capable of implementing ML algorithms for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. As a result, FL has been widely applied to various intelligent applications in wireless IoT networks. However, mobile devices usually have relatively limited computing and communication resources when executing FL tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. First, limited computing resources at the mobile devices will cause inadequate local training, and thus degrade local model performance. Second, lack of communication resources, such as available channels and transmission power, may prevent devices from uploading their models successfully, therefore leading to an insufficient number of local models for global aggregation. Furthermore, data heterogeneity due to non-independently and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data and different data sizes of training samples on clients will result in significant divergence among local models, which is harmful for improving global model performance after aggregation.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL in wireless scenarios has drawn considerable attention recently. Much of the research in this area has concentrated on scheduling clients and allocating wireless resources to accelerate learning convergence and reduce the power consumption of the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> designed an algorithm for selecting a proper number of local update epoches in each communication round. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> defined a combined metric of each client which jointly considered the learning quality and the channel quality. To optimize the learning performance via client selecting, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> designed different scheduling schemes under wireless constraints. Furthermore, constraints such as client fairness and computational capability have been taken into account in recent research on FL optimization. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> measured importance of samples among all clients and selected important samples to update the model.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> The performance of wireless FL was enhanced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> via weighted local loss functions with the consideration of model fairness. And <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> derived the relationship between the performance and consumptions of computation and communication. Integrating wireless power transfer technology into FL, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> constructed a tradeoff between model convergence and transmission power.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">The preceding studies primarily concentrated on wireless resource allocation but often overlooked the issue of data heterogeneity among clients while optimizing performance under wireless constraints. In fact, achieving fair scheduling for training non-IID data contradicts the varying abilities of client participation due to differences in data sizes. Consequently, the above optimization methods are not suitable for addressing wireless FL with data heterogeneity.<span id="S1.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text">Some researchers attempted to handle this problem with additional datasets. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the server shared a training dataset with clients to mitigate the highly non-IID characteristics of local datasets. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a dataset was used in the server to assign a trust score to each local model, which then influenced the updating of the global model based on the trust scores. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> assessed the heterogeneity and fairness of local models by evaluating their performance on a common dataset. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for these methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> was proved to be challenging, as it needs to guide models towards better performance. Moreover, using additional datasets adds to the computational burden, energy consumption, and latency. In contrast, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed an asynchronous FL framework that employed a two-stage aggregation to mitigate the impact of non-IID data without relying on additional datasets. Nonetheless, this work overlooked the chaotic allocation of wireless resources in the asynchronous FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> scheduled clients based on the accurate distribution of all clients, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> shared encoded local datasets among all clients to address data heterogeneity. However these requirements concerning local datasets are impractical in wireless FL, where data privacy is emphasized. Hence, applying the new frameworks of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> in wireless FL are challenging.<span id="S1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text">Some other studies retained the basic FL framework while modifying training methods. As an example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed different clients could train heterogeneous models based on their computation and communication capabilities. However, the comparisons to conventional optimization methods of wireless FL were insufficient, and the performance cost of training heterogeneous models lacked theoretical analysis. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, a divergence penalty term was introduced in the objective function to accelerate and stabilize the training process on heterogeneous data. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> considered feature shift non-IID of sample inputs and utilized local batch normalization in the training process. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> employed a dropout method for local models, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> normalized local models with different numbers of local epochs among clients. Nevertheless, these works did not
jointly optimize client scheduling and resource allocation in wireless networks. To sum up, the primary limitation of existing researches lies in the lack of a joint consideration of communication constraints and data heterogeneity for wireless FL.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

To demonstrate the benefit of CREs, other 3 algorithms are included: <span id="S5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">(d) FedNova algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> that normalizes local models with different local epochs.<span id="S5.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> (e) channel-allocate algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> that only optimizes client scheduling and channel allocation with a fixed number of local epochs. <span id="S5.p4.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">(f) importance-aware algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> optimize client scheduling with fixed channel allocation and a fixed number of local epochs.</span></span></span></p>

It can be observed from all subfigures that our CRE algorithm achieves the highest accuracy and the fastest convergence. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">The underlaying reason is that our CRE algorithm optimizes FL performance with a joint consideration of communication
constraints and the data heterogeneity. From Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Trade-off between Performance and Energy Consumption ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Federated Learning with Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), (b), it can be seen that the channel-allocate algorithm and the importance-aware algorithm perform better than basic baselines and the FedNova algorithm. It is due to the fact that these two algorithms optimize the performance of wireless FL and can handle the scene with low heterogeneity. However in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Trade-off between Performance and Energy Consumption ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Federated Learning with Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(d), it is obvious that the two algorithms both get worse, while our proposed CRE algorithm is still the best. The reason is that the two algorithms can not tackle the high heterogeneity without acquiring the characteristic of data heterogeneity. The FedNova algorithm, by contrast, keeps stable performance in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Trade-off between Performance and Energy Consumption ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Federated Learning with Data Heterogeneity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a)-(d). However, due to lack of optimization of communication, the performance of the FedNova algorithm can not reach the performance of our CRE algorithm.<span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

It is noticed that as the number of clients increases, FL performance gets better and the energy consumption gradually decreases. These improvements attribute to more datasets and more channel states to choose, which are consequences of more clients. With the larger feasible region, our CRE algorithm can further pursue high performance and low energy consumption. Such a conclusion validates our CRE algorithm in the scene with more clients. When the number of clients reaches 30, improvements of more clients are few. This is due to the fact that constraints on FL performance and energy consumption are primarily influenced by the scarcity of channels rather than the increasing number of clients.

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed an optimization problem of CREs for FL with different data sizes and non-IID data over wireless networks. First, an optimization problem of client scheduling, channel allocation, uplink power control, and number of local epochs design has been formulated to minimize the final loss function. To characterize the loss function, we have developed a closed-form upper bound with the dataset size vector and the data divergence vector. Moreover, we have proposed a method to estimate model property parameters and the data divergence vector. Then, by means of Lyapunov technique, the formulated problem for the whole process has been transformed into a one-communication-round problem, which can be solved by using Tammer decomposition. Our simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm works well for solving data heterogeneity among the clients. Compared to baselines, our method <span id="S6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text">has<span id="S6.p1.2.2.2" class="ltx_text"> achieved the best accuracy with lower energy consumption.
