<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Future autonomous vehicles (AVs) will use a variety of sensors that generate a vast amount of data. Naturally, this data not only serves self-driving algorithms; but can also assist other vehicles or the infrastructure in real-time decision-making. Consequently, vehicles shall exchange their measurement data over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies.
Moreover, predicting the state of the road network might be beneficial too. With such a prediction, we might mitigate road congestion, balance parking lot usage, or optimize the traffic flow. That would decrease transportation costs as well as reduce its environmental impact.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a federated measurement and learning system that provides real-time data to fellow vehicles over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication while also operating a federated learning (FL) scheme over the Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) link to create a predictive model of the transportation network.
As we are yet to have real-world AV data, we model it with a non-IID (independent and identically distributed) dataset to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed system in terms of performance and privacy. Results indicate that the proposed FL scheme improves learning performance and prevents eavesdropping at the aggregator server side.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While navigating through cities, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be required to collect and process enormous amounts of data. This data contains raw measurement values (e.g., following distance) and derived observations (e.g., number of empty parking spaces on the spot). As these kinds of data further away from the trajectory of a vehicle might be hard to obtain, it is natural to exchange such knowledge among vehicles. The Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication techniques can provide a channel for this information change. The received information might help the AVs in real-time operational (e.g., finding an empty parking lot) or tactical decision-making (e.g., heading towards an area that is supposed to offer many free parking spaces).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the collected data, especially the derived ones, describes the actual traffic situation, AVs or even road operators shall access and process it. This data might support strategic planning that mitigates traffic congestion and optimizes the traffic flow (e.g., by building new parking lots or adjusting their pricing). Consequently, we might minimize the environmental impact of transportation. However, exchanging such enormous datasets over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks is challenging. We assume that this knowledge will be represented and distributed among the stakeholders (e.g., among AVs and road operators) as a machine learning model, e.g., the weight matrix of a neural network. Such representation has numerous benefits: it is a compressed extract of the data collected by the AVs, has predictive power, and can adapt to the changes in the road network. On a Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) channel, AVs can download the actual model from a central server and use its predictions for tactical planning (e.g., inferring the current parking lot occupancy rate in a neighborhood). AVs can also contribute to the training process of this model by participating in a federated learning (FL) system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, AVs only have data about a relatively small area as they can only sense phenomena (e.g., parking lot occupancy) along their routes. Such data necessarily forms a not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) dataset. Non-IID data can cause performance issues and open the way for privacy threats for the FL system. In this paper, our essential contribution is <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">addressing the problem of non-IID datasets by incorporating raw data sharing into the traditional FL scheme</em> for intelligent vehicles. As a proof of concept, we model the data of AVs by partitioning a well-known benchmark dataset MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. We assume raw data sharing is through a trusted (V2V) channel, while the participants access the FL server through a separate, untrusted (V2N) line. Based on this assumption, we demonstrate how raw data sharing improves learning speed and mitigates privacy issues.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It will be vital to use V2X communication to exploit the merits of AVs. Connected vehicles can implement platoons and minimize the following distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or make it possible to improve intersection management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As the V2X channel bandwidth is limited, we shall consider how to reduce the number of exchanged data packages. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, channel usage can be optimized by estimating and maximizing the information gains over the observations. This approach is theoretically related to the one described in this paper, but here, we aim to balance the datasets of the AVs to mitigate the effects of non-IID data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the numerous security mechanisms of V2X communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, handling non-IID data on the application level is still an important issue. The non-IID nature of the data might disclose information about a vehicle’s route revealing the origins and destinations of the passengers. In the case of commercial vehicles, that would mean that the whole supply chain of a company might be exposed. To mitigate this problem, there are both low-level solutions, such as using pseudonyms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and certificates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, as well as application-level solutions, e.g., maximizing the location entropy in social internet of vehicle applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The abovementioned solutions require a trusted third (or even fourth) party. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, that has gained popularity recently, may provide a simpler solution by an adoption to the vehicular domain. However, FL needs to exchange data periodically, which might be challenging in V2X communication; <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proved that FL works even in poor networking conditions. Although multiple papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> refer to FL as a privacy-protecting scheme, the survey in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> demonstrates how difficult it might be to secure an FL system. Most of the privacy-preserving FL mechanisms build on either distorting the data or classical cryptographic approaches that might be vulnerable to quantum computer algorithms. Considering the long lifespan of a vehicle or a piece of infrastructural equipment, we shall consider the post-quantum cryptography problem, which might be impossible with traditional solutions according to the survey of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. FL has vulnerabilities against either active or passive attacks in the V2X domain. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> mitigates the impact of an active attack against the FL system; in this study, as an elaboration of our concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, we focus on a passive eavesdropping attack against an FL scheme at a V2N server side and its prevention by trusted V2V communication.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The principal assumption for our work is an extensive V2V information exchange between the vehicles. AVs can use the received data in real-time operational decision-making. Moreover, the retrieved knowledge (along with an AV’s own measurements) can serve as training data for machine learning mechanisms. As V2V implementations are usually direct connections between two vehicles, we assume this channel is trusted and secure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, the community of AVs might measure some phenomena, e.g., congestion levels or occupancy rate of parking lots, that are beneficial to improve the traffic flow. Intelligent traffic controller systems, or even AVs can exploit the merits of such knowledge encapsulated in a queryable predictive model. To build such a model, we propose a vehicular FL system. The aggregator server of this system shall reside in the cloud, see Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II System Architecture ‣ A V2X-based Privacy Preserving Federated Measuring and Learning System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, and the <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">participant</em> AVs shall connect to this server via V2N solutions and download the actual federated model. Additionally, the server can request a subset of the available AVs to train their local model and upload their updated weight matrix. The server runs a FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> algorithm to create the next version of the federated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the link between the AVs and the cloud is indirect, including, e.g., routers and switches, we might not safely assume that this link is secure. To prevent a successful eavesdropping attack against the vehicular FL system, we propose that AVs use their measurement data together with the information received over the V2V communication to moderate their non-IID characteristics. We expect this will improve the speed of the training process by potentially utilizing more data. Also, in this way, by reducing the non-IID nature of the training data of the participant AVs, it will lower the probability of a successful cyber attack. (It may also attenuate the bias of the optimal global model, but this problem is out of the scope of this paper.)</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the proposed FL system, we implemented a small model consisting of 10 participants (that represent the AVs) and an aggregation server. Whenever the server initiated a communication round, the participants exchanged a part of their training datasets (modeling the V2V communication).

We assume that such communication technologies will have a limited range; therefore, in the modeled situation, vehicles can exchange data when they are close to each other, e.g., in the city center. We also wanted to model that AVs’ recent measurements form possibly only a small dataset. Consequently, a small to-be-sent dataset was calculated for each vehicle in every communication round (simulated day, see Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="III-D Training Process ‣ III Evaluation ‣ A V2X-based Privacy Preserving Federated Measuring and Learning System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-D</span></span></a>).

However, the exchanged raw data can also be an input for real-time decision-making; this aspect is out of the scope of the current paper. Hence, we assume that each record is equally important, and the vehicles can sample their data randomly upon knowledge exchange. This way, we aimed to balance each participant’s dataset to be more IID and to test its effect on the proposed FL system.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a federated measuring and learning system architecture that utilizes the capabilities of V2X communication. Within this system, fellow vehicles share real-time information on V2V channels. In the meantime, the AVs train a federated machine learning model and communicate with a central aggregating server by V2N techniques. We propose that the AVs shall incorporate the real-time data exchanged on V2V into their training dataset to make it more independently and identically distributed. By adopting a benchmark machine learning problem, the handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset, we provided experimental results that the <em id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">proposed learning scheme improves the learning performance and, at the same time, mitigates the possible passive eavesdropping attacks against private information</em> in V2X communication systems.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, there are various FL aggregation algorithms that handle data heterogeneity (e.g., FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>) and enhance model accuracy; but these methods do not guarantee privacy-preservation assuming the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication between the participants and the aggregator server.

When calculating such a dataset, the sender might focus on achieving the highest possible data utility to provide information for the real-time decision algorithms of the receiver. However, in the meantime, the sender shall keep its private information hidden while minimizing also the usage of the communication channel. Solving these competing interests is a challenging task. In the future, our research will focus on solving this problem.</p>
