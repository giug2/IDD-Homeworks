<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Quality control is a crucial activity performed by manufacturing companies to ensure their products conform to the requirements and specifications. The introduction of artificial intelligence models enables to automate the visual quality inspection, speeding up the inspection process and ensuring all products are evaluated under the same criteria. In this research, we compare supervised and unsupervised defect detection techniques and explore data augmentation techniques to mitigate the data imbalance in the context of automated visual inspection. Furthermore, we use Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation to enhance the classifiers’ discriminative performance. Our results show that state-of-the-art unsupervised defect detection does not match the performance of supervised models but can be used to reduce the labeling workload by more than 50%. Furthermore, the best classification performance was achieved considering GAN-based data generation with AUC ROC scores equal to or higher than 0,9898, even when increasing the dataset imbalance by leaving only 25% of the images denoting defective products. We performed the research with real-world data provided by <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV</span>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We frame the visual inspection problem as a supervised learning problem. This paper addresses the problems of class imbalance and data scarcity regarding defective pieces. These are critical visual inspection problems in manufacturing since increasing products’ quality only increases the class imbalance over time and makes it harder to improve the models’ classification performance. It is thus imperative to devise strategies that can be used to mitigate such an issue. To that end, we conduct a series of experiments to (a) compare our classification models to a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) unsupervised defect detection method, (b) understand how using trivial techniques to balance the dataset influences the classifier’s performance, (c) we devote particular attention to the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to generate synthetic images of defective parts and evaluate how such a balanced dataset influences the classifier’s discrimination performance, and (d) simulate more severe class imbalances, to understand how would the classifiers could behave in the future, as we expect a higher scarcity of defective parts when products’ quality increases. We developed the machine learning models with images provided by the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV</span> corporation. The dataset comprises shaver images classified into three categories based on the defects observed regarding logo printing: good, double print, and interrupted print.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Automated visual inspection is an automatic form of non-destructive testing in quality control, achieved through one or multiple cameras that provide visual input and visual processing techniques that allow for detecting defects (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Czimmermann et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>). The visual inspection aims to identify functional and cosmetic defects (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chin and Harlow (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">1982</a>)</cite>). Automated visual inspection techniques can be either supervised (requiring labeled data) or unsupervised (requiring no labeling). SOTA image processing techniques involve the use of deep learning (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pouyanfar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>). Authors frequently use pre-trained models, either as feature extractors (to avoid costly feature engineering) or for end-to-end learning, either by training the model from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained one (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018a</a>)</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The decreased cost of sensors and their implementation in production lines in the context of Industry 4.0 produces greater amounts of digital data (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Benbarrad et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>), which can be leveraged for automated visual inspection (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Peres et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>). Given that the reliability of manufactured products is of utmost importance, inspecting all parts is desired. Such inspection translates into great costs, which can be significantly decreased by automating the visual inspection process. The main benefits of such automation are the savings related to human labor costs, the ability to match production and inspection speeds, and error traceability, which provides relevant information to guide management decisions (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chin and Harlow (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">1982</a>)</cite>).</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Successful automated visual inspection implementations report using Artificial Intelligence models to ensure the quality of printing (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Villalba-Diez et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>), steel surface defects (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jia et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>). The most commonly used algorithms are the Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbours, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ren et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Labeling data availability is critical to train and to enhance supervised artificial intelligence models. While the acquisition of data can be cheap, the labeling process is expensive in terms of time and costs since it requires human persons to review the images and provide labels for them. In addition, when inspecting data related to products’ quality, it is to expect a strong class imbalance: most of the data instances correspond to good products, and just a minor proportion of them refer to defective pieces. If the class imbalance is not reduced, (a) most of the labeling time will be devoted to images of non-defective products, which provide little information to the model, (b) and operators will be prone to skip cases that correspond to defective pieces, confusing such an instance with the many ones that correspond to non-defective products. Given the products’ quality improves over time, such class imbalance will be more pronounced. An alternative to expensive data labeling could be the generation of synthetic images corresponding to defective parts. Such a solution would require an initial dataset but enable an unlimited supply of synthetic images, which could be used to enrich the dataset and eventually avoid most of the labeling procedure. Furthermore, such an approach could also be effective in settings where different cameras are installed on each production line, thus producing images with different characteristics (e.g., different color scales). Such a setting could likely prevent using the images of different production lines in a single dataset but require different datasets for images of different characteristics. Using synthetic images could alleviate much of the manual workload required to gather the data over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Datasets built for the supervised defect detection use case are usually small and imbalanced, given the cost required to obtain and label data instances from a dataset. It is thus important to choose such data augmentation methods that can deliver value regardless of the size of the dataset. While classical data augmentation techniques, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, or more recent variants, such as DeepSMOTE are frequently used, GANs can learn a function that can approximate model distribution close to a true distribution, generating high fidelity (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sampath et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>). While the dataset size could prevent training autoencoders or GANs from scratch, transfer learning can leverage pre-trained neural networks and fine-tune them to comply with the task. There has been extensive research on applying transfer learning to GANs, but many methods relying on traditional weight fine-tuning still fall short when faced with small datasets (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018b</a>)</cite>). A solution successfully applied to BigGAN and SN-GAN is to focus only on fine-tuning the batch normalization layers, thus reducing the number of adjustable weights (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Noguchi and Harada (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>). The latter is intuitively equivalent to selecting those features relevant to the current dataset. Some preliminary results using the above method on a pre-trained BigGAN, have shown a significant increase in classifier accuracy after augmenting the original dataset. While imperfect, the images produced seem to retain some of the features needed for classification. Combining generated and original images to increase quality is possible, as done by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Satoshi Tsutsui (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">GANs have been successfully used in various industrial scenarios to tackle class imbalance in defect detection problems. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jain et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> compare three GANs (DC-GAN, Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), and Information-theoretic GAN (InfoGAN)) applied for steel streep defect detection. In their research, GANs enable an improved classification sensitivity from the baseline (consisting only of graphical image transformations), with DC-GAN performing the best. DC-GAN was combined with geometric transformations in a fiber layup inspection setting, providing high-quality synthetic images for datasets with less than fifty representative original images per class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Meister et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, on the other hand, applied DC-GANs to generate images regarding solar cell defects, achieving substantial improvements only after combining real and synthetic images using a randomized boolean mosaic approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This research uses classical data augmentation techniques and the Lightweight GAN (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>) to augment the dataset with synthetic data instances. Classical data augmentation techniques are applied to the feature vectors that result from the feature extraction process. At the same time, the Lightweight GAN is used to create synthetic images, which are added to the regular dataset and then processed to extract the required features.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Use Case</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This research considered the visual inspection task performed on shavers manufactured by <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV</span>. This non-destructive quality control testing focuses on a cosmetic aspect of the product quality: whether the <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV</span> company logo was printed correctly and eventually detects defective printings and determines the type of defective printing. To perform such an inspection, the company uses different pad-printing setups. Countless products are manufactured daily, and they are handled and inspected. Defective products are removed from the production line. An automated visual quality inspection system could strongly reduce manual work and decrease the inspection time by up to 40%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For this research, a labeled dataset of 3.518 images was provided. The effort required to label such a dataset is close to eight man-hours and could rise to twenty-four man-hours if some triaging labeling strategy is introduced to increase the quality of the labeling. Images were labeled into three categories: ”good” (no defect was detected), ”double printing”, and ”interrupted printing”. We tackle the problem as a binary classification and a multiclass classification task.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">4 </span>Methodology and Experiments</h2>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We framed the automated defect detection as a binary classification problem (defective vs. non-defective) and a multiclass classification problem (classifying the images into one of three possible categories: good, double print, or interrupted print). To measure the models’ discriminative power, we computed the AUC ROC metric. In the case of multiclass classification, we adopted the ”one-vs-rest” heuristic. The heuristic splits the dataset to compute the AUC ROC metric for each class. Then a final value is obtained by calculating the weighted average, weighting the AUC ROC scores of each class by the proportion of true instances of that class in the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the models, we divided the dataset using a stratified ten-fold cross-validation (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zeng and Martinez (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>); Kuhn et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>). When performing data augmentation to balance the dataset, we considered the instances in the training set of the current k-fold cross-validation instance. While this meant computing ten times the instances for data augmentation, where necessary, at the same time ensured the instances were as close as possible to the data distribution observed in the training set when training the model. We used the Lightweight GAN to perform GAN-based data augmentation. To assess the quality of the synthetic images when compared to the original ones, we measured the Fréchet Inception Distance, which is defined as the squared Wasserstein metric between two multidimensional Gaussian distributions: the distribution that corresponds to features from the real-world images, and the one that corresponds to features from the synthetic images.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Throughout the experiments, we used a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rosenblatt (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">1958</a>)</cite> as a baseline and compared it in different settings and against other models. All experiments were performed with four variations of the dataset: (a) considering all data available and reducing the number of images corresponding to defective parts so that only (b) 75%, (c) 50%, and (d) 25% are left. Doing so enabled us to understand how the models perform under the existing circumstances and how their performance can change over time when the products’ quality improves, and the proportion of defective products decreases. Furthermore, a good classifier’s performance under heavier imbalance would also inform data collection and labeling efforts. For example, the need for fewer defective product samples could shorten the data collection time and reduce the number of images to label, with the consequent resource gains (time, people availability, and money).</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>), which is considered a SOTA model for unsupervised anomaly detection. DRAEM trains an autoencoder to reconstruct images to look like non-defective pieces. The original and reconstructed images are then fed to a discriminative sub-network, which identifies the anomalous regions to create an anomaly map. However, given that this model can only inform if a defect is present, it cannot be compared against a supervised model in a multiclass setting. We used the following model parameters: for the baseline model, the MLP was built with two dense layers (with 512 and 100 features), with an intermediate ReLU activation between both dense layers and a softmax activation at the output. The GBT model was instantiated with a maximum tree depth of ten, the multiclass loss function, and trained over sixty iterations.</p>

A strong advantage of the GANs is that they learn to produce realistic data instances based on the feedback provided by a discriminator, which attempts to identify which images were artificially generated and which ones correspond to the original dataset.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">After corroborating the positive outcome of oversampling on the supervised models, we explored if synthetic images generated with GANs could further enhance the classifiers’ performance. Our premise was that the similarity between the original and synthetic image distributions and the greater amount of data would boost the classifiers’ performance. We thus explore whether the inclusion of synthetic images generated with a Lightweight GAN model enhances the models’ performance and how additional class imbalance affects the GANs and the classifiers’ performance. Given the poor performance of the Gradient Boosted Trees model, we experimented with the baseline model only.</p>

We assumed that while using embeddings from a pre-trained ResNet18 model provided excellent features for a classifier, better features could be obtained by a simple CNN model trained directly on our dataset, given the visual simplicity of the images at hand. Furthermore, we trained the model on the original dataset (without data oversampling), considering two cases: training with an unweighted and a weighted loss. The weighted loss is a class imbalance mitigation technique that allows weighting the loss differently for different samples, considering whether they belong to the majority or a minority class. These two settings make the CNN comparable to the supervised models in <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Experiment 1</span> (for the unweighted loss), and <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Experiment 2</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Experiment 3</span> when using the weighted loss.</p>

After carefully analyzing those instances, we concluded that errors were likely made when labeling data instances to both categories, though the errors were not confirmed.

Such an approach could automate the labeling of good images (saving more than 50% of manual work) and let the labeling people concentrate on the defective parts.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This research compared supervised and unsupervised classification models and explored data augmentation techniques to avoid class imbalance in the automated visual inspection use case. We confirmed that supervised models outperform SOTA unsupervised defect detection models. Furthermore, the best classifier discrimination performance was achieved with GAN-based data augmentation and an MLP classifier, using a pre-trained ResNet18 as a feature extractor. We used the Lightweight GAN implementation to generate images regarding defective pieces. The GAN achieved good quality images while consuming few resources. From the results obtained, we consider (a) unsupervised models can be of great utility to identify images corresponding to non-defective pieces and automatically label them, thus reducing labeling work for at least 50%; (b) GANs can be used to reduce further the effort required to gather (e.g., by reducing the waiting time to get a defective piece) and label images of defective pieces, by generating synthetic images; and (c) supervised classification models achieve the best performance, and thus are the best choice when deploying them to production, to automate the visual inspection. Future work will focus on designing a pipeline that implements (a) and (b), along with explainable artificial intelligence techniques, to enhance labeling and manual revision. In particular, the pipeline will reduce the workload, provide hints to the users to ease the labeling effort, and monitor users’ attention to ensure the best labeling quality.</p>
