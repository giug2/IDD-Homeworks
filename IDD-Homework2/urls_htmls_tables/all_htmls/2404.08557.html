<p id="9.1" class="ltx_p">Computer vision models trained on Google Street View images can create material cadastres. However, current approaches need manually annotated datasets that are difficult to obtain and often have class imbalance. To address these challenges, this paper fine-tuned a Swin Transformer model on a synthetic dataset generated with OpenAI’s DALL-E and compared the performance to a similar manually annotated dataset. Although manual annotation remains the gold standard, the synthetic dataset performance demonstrates a reasonable alternative. The findings will ease annotation needed to develop material cadastres, offering architects insights into opportunities for material reuse, thus contributing to the reduction of demolition waste.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Demolition waste from construction and renovation activity is a growing problem internationally, making up 25%-30% of all waste generated in the EU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Anastasiou, Georgiadis Filikas and
Stefanidou, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
There is a general consensus that current practices have room for improvement for diverting and recovering materials from demolition waste <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kabirifar, Mojtahedi, Wang and
Tam, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recovering demolition waste is not a common activity in many countries because there remain limitations that practitioners currently face. Not having insight into the
availability of which specific materials will be available and at what time is often identified as a top barrier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Akanbi, Oyedele, Oyedele and
Salami, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. The planning of
projects that could use recovered materials typically begin several years before the actual construction begins. A material cadastre that maps detailed building material
information for every building at the scale of a country with an estimate of when the materials could become available would significantly alleviate the current time window bottleneck.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the significant potential of this solution, several researchers have turned their attention to developing city-scale material cadastres with computer vision
models trained on images of building exteriors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Raghu, Bucher and
De Wolf, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Arbabi, Lanau, Li, Meyers, Dai, Mayfield and
Densley Tingley, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. A top pain-point in developing these models is acquiring the training data
necessary for machine learning (ML). For deep learning models, some practitioners say that the size of training data should be 10x the number of weights in a network
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Baum and Haussler, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1988</a>)</cite>—often leading to six figure digits and more.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, because the type of material is not known before the GPS coordinates are requested to collect training data, this process can lead to some materials (i.e. classes) having higher counts
than other classes—also known as class imbalance. ML practitioners try to avoid class imbalance because a ML model will place importance on a class
that has a higher chance of occurring in the training data. For example, if brick is the most common material in the training data, then the model is likely to predict brick
when deployed in a real-world situation. This effect can be negligible if brick actually is the most common material in a city, but it is preferable to assume equal class
counts since the true distribution of materials in a city is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The scale achieved by previous studies has been at the scale of a city; however, the blue sky vision for a tool like this would be at the scale of a country.
This would mimic current practices of sourcing materials while staying within the bounds of maximum distance for a recovered material to travel before its sustainability
benefits become negligible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ginga, Ongpeng and Daly, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. There is some truth to the logic that if a model works at the scale of a city then it should have similar
performance at the scale of a country; however, previous studies have identified that several problems can arise when scaling an image classification task
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Maggiori, Tarabalka, Charpiat and
Alliez, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Perronnin, Sánchez and
Mensink, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Hendrycks, Basart, Mazeika, Zou, Kwon,
Mostajabi, Steinhardt and
Song, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. For example, wood siding
can take on different colours and textures in different cities since it is often a regional material, but an image classification model may struggle to perform well if it hasn’t
been trained on wood with a particular colour. Because it’s impossible to foresee all potential
quirks that may arise with a given use case, it’s important to move beyond proof-of-concepts at the scale of a city and demonstrate that the model maintains reasonable
performance at the scale of a country.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, it would be desirable to test an image classification model’s performance on residential and office interiors since this layer of a building typically has a high rate of change, resulting in a potentially high yield of reusable renovation waste. However, obtaining large and diverse datasets of building interiors can be challenging because of privacy concerns, data access limitations, and the labor-intensive process of data collection and annotation. As a result, public datasets for this task are limited in size, diversity, and representativeness, which may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world interior environments. Addressing the scarcity of this type of dataset could unlock an important layer in the quest for creating country-wide material cadastres.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of using synthetically generated images to augment and extend previous research done to classify façade
materials in Google Street View (GSV) images. More specifically, the research questions that this paper addresses are:</p>

</div>
<div id="Sx1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The results from these research questions make several contributions to the field of urban mining for material cadastres. To the authors’ best knowledge, no previous studies have
utilized synthetic images that mimic GSV images for augmenting and extending an image classification model to detect façade material. As a result, we present a novel approach
to reduce the amount of time needed to develop a training dataset for the classification of façade materials, as well as provide an indication of the potential to use synthetic images to create datasets that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. Additionally, we present two methods to decrease errors in the current
approaches: utilizing a higher resolution model by reducing the problem space and augmenting a manually annotated dataset to correct class imbalance. The workflow developed
in this research can be extended to detect façade materials that have no manually annotated training data and the workflow can be used to improve performance of the current
state-of-the-art for this specific use case.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In 2023, researchers from ETH Zurich published the first urban-scale ground truth dataset—hereon referred to as the Urban Resource Cadastre (URC) dataset—to detect façade

De Wolf, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. The researchers collected this data by first identifying GPS coordinates of
interest, requesting the corresponding GSV image for these GPS coordinates, and manually annotating all resulting images. This dataset contains 971 annotated 400x600 pixel
images with the labels ‘brick’, ‘stucco’, ‘rustication’, ‘metal’, ‘siding’, ‘wood’, ‘null’ (for images with no façade), and ‘other’ (for façade material that did
not belong to any of the other labels). However, the authors noted that collecting this type of dataset can easily become a time-consuming process.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Generating images for training data</h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there were significant developments with synthetic images generated for the purpose of training downstream models. Research in this area is often fueled by
use cases where acquiring more data is time/cost prohibitive, it is necessary to mask personally identifiable information for privacy, or it is not possible to collect data
at all <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Man and Chahl, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. There exists a wide variety of generative text-to-image models; however, it has recently been accepted that diffusion models outperform
previous text-to-image generative models. Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models replicate the diffusion process observed in physics by teaching a deep
learning model to add and reverse noise in images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sohl-Dickstein, Weiss, Maheswaranathan and
Ganguli, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.SSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The lack of diversity within a synthetic dataset is a known limitation associated with generating images for training models. To overcome this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>
used “language enhancement” to add variety to the prompts given to the generative model while also using a filter to discard images that didn’t resemble the target image.
The “language enhancement” involved using a simple keyword-to-sentence Natural Language Processing (NLP) model based on the T5 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He, Sun, Yu, Xue, Zhang, Torr, Bai and
Qi, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>
to make sentences from keywords. This method to diversify the generated output is prone to straying far from the desired image, however. To counteract this effect,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a “CLIP Filter” that leveraged CLIP zero-shot classification confidence. However, the authors aimed to create a fully
automated process, which could be excessive for use cases where there is enough value in just generating synthetic images alone—which is this paper’s use case.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At this point, it becomes apparent that we should justify the selection of specific façade materials for the synthetic generation of images. For example, there exist buildings
built with ETFE plastic bubbles, but since these projects are rare, their inclusion in a training dataset would confuse a ML model. While research in the area
of the reusability potential of specific building materials is rather sparse, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Icibaci (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Iacovidou and Purnell (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> identified stone with lime-based mortar, curtain walls, and concrete panels as materials with high reusability potential—hereon referred to as the High Reusability Potential (HRP) labels.</p>

the augmented, mixed, and synthetic experiments (shown in Figure <a href="#Sx3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Materials ‣ Experiment ‣ SCALABILITY IN BUILDING COMPONENT DATA ANNOTATION: ENHANCING FAÇADE MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION WITH SYNTHETIC DATA" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), varying amounts of 512x512 pixel synthetic images were generated.

reduce the parameter space of the image classification model. ‘Stucco’ and ‘siding’ were isolated as two labels of interest because ‘stucco’ had a similar class distribution
as the ‘null’ and ‘other’ labels, and because ‘siding’ had a high class imbalance in the original dataset. Therefore, there were two sub-experiments for the baseline,

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are several open source versions of diffusion models that are capable of creating synthetic images; however, the effort required to get them into an operational state can often be time-prohibitive while also
requiring intensive hardware. For that reason, OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 model was chosen to generate images because it is the most effective to leverage with just a simple API request. A portmanteau of the famous surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and the Pixar character WALL-E, DALL-E takes in a user defined text prompt to create highly realistic images. The DALL-E 2 text-to-image generation model was trained on 650 million images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ramesh et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>; however, OpenAI does not disclose the source of training data for any of their models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
To reduce this dependency on an external organization, it would be ideal to develop an open source model in-house, however.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A limitation of generating synthetic GSV images was the inability for DALL-E to create believable images with more than one façade material. Other researchers found
similar difficulties when requesting more than three components with descriptions about shape or colours <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Marcus, Davis and
Aaronson, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Additionally, it was
possible to utilize a higher resolution image classification model by reducing the label set to one material of interest combined with the ‘null’ and ‘other’ labels. For
these reasons, it was decided to generate images with one label. Since this paper’s use case would not require predicting several labels in real-time, it is
proposed that the implementation would require several models with each model focusing on one label (as well as the non-buildings and other materials).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned earlier, there was enough value in creating the synthetic images alone to not utilize a fully automated filtering process. Therefore, a brute force version of

hundred images by randomly sampling a prompt from the collection, manually removing irrelevant images from the final dataset, and taking note of the few prompts that were
likely to produce the best images. The remaining dataset was generated using this final collection of ‘high batting average’ prompts.</p>

For this experiment, the facade material label was given possible synonyms, a time period when the façade material was likely to be common, and cities where the facade material can be found. However, these keywords could be extended to any aspect of a building, such as type, size, or neighbourhood density. For example, ‘siding’ was assigned the
synonyms ’shiplap’, ’feather edge’, ’fiber cement’ and the time period ’20th century’. For all labels in the augmented and mixed experiments, the original URC
dataset cities (New York City, Zurich, and Tokyo) were used as keywords. For the synthetic experiments, the cities ’Vancouver’, ’San Francisco’, and ’Amsterdam’ were chosen arbitrarily but would benefit from additional cities in future experiments.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the image classification task, it was decided to use a Swin Transformer model pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset to maximize comparability to previous studies and
to leverage a well-known image classification model. A pre-trained image classification model is trained on a large generic dataset with the intention to later ’fine-tune’ the ’head’ of the model on tailored datasets. This method generally improves accuracy and reduces the need for a large tailored dataset. The ImageNet-21k dataset is commonly used for pre-training because it is 14 million images with 21,000 labels and contains a variety of natural images. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Raghu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.93 by applying the pre-trained Swin Transformer v2 model
to the URC dataset. However, the authors used the model version with a resolution of 192 pixels, which was not adequate for the synthetic image dataset. It was seen that the
synthetic images struggled with creating the same texture detail as real images, and this data loss was compounded when used with a low-resolution model. This is akin to
taking a photocopy of a photocopy. Therefore, the experiments in this study use the Swin Transformer v2 model with 384 pixel resolution.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To provide a quantitative and objective measurement of the image classification performance, it was decided to calculate the weighted F1 score, precision, recall, as well as
create a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graph and confusion matrices for each experiment. The confusion matrix is a grid of all target labels with the y-axis
representing the true test values and the x-axis representing the predicted test values. In this way, it’s possible to index how many samples were predicted for a specific
label: the first cell in the grid shows the number of samples predicted as ‘null’ were correctly classified. It is not possible to decide which dataset performed the best by
looking at these confusion matrices, however, so quantitative metrics were calculated: precision and recall.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p11.1" class="ltx_p">When working with multi-class problems, it is necessary to choose an averaging mechanism for the F1 score, precision, and recall metrics. The ‘weighted’ average is recommended
for imbalanced classes because it assigns different weights to each class based on their prevalence in the dataset. This prevents the dominant class from strongly influencing
these metrics.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As with many NLP models, the generated prompts contained a fair amount of hallucination; however, these nonsensical prompts surprisingly created some of the best images. For
example, a successful prompt for the ‘stone’ label was, ”The construction of building made of stone is in the medium of the Artistic Gymnastics.” It was valuable to refrain
from editorial oversight of the initial prompts to allow for spontaneity in the generated images. Because of this, the resulting datasets had more diversity than if
one prompt created all the synthetic images.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The confusion matrix compares the number of true labels versus predicted labels. To aid in comparability and interpretability, the numbers of each row in the matrix were
normalized to a percentage scale of 0% to 100%. The set of confusion matrices (Figure <a href="#Sx4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Image generation ‣ Discussion and result analysis ‣ SCALABILITY IN BUILDING COMPONENT DATA ANNOTATION: ENHANCING FAÇADE MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION WITH SYNTHETIC DATA" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) show which labels perform the worst and best for each experiment and whether any degradation of performance
is acceptable. Comparing the augmented stucco experiment to the baseline, it can be seen that the augmented dataset offered a slight advantage for the ‘null’ and ‘other’
labels, while maintaining perfect performance for the ‘stucco’ label. When using the mixed dataset, there was decrease in performance (100% of true ‘stucco’ samples predicted
as ‘stucco’ versus 91% of true ‘stucco’ samples predicted as ‘stucco’). Moving to the siding experiment set, the augmented siding experiment had a decrease in performance
(as opposed to the augmented stucco experiment). This is likely because the ‘siding’ augmented class had a higher proportion of synthetic to manually annotated images, which
triggers the question that there might be a threshold where the ratio of synthetic to manually annotated images hinders performance. The mixed siding experiment showed further degradation with only 48% of predicted ‘siding’
samples matching the true ‘siding’ label. This may have been caused by the size of the mixed siding dataset (248 training samples and 62 testing samples for each class), which
was half the size of the mixed stucco dataset (596 training samples and 149 testing samples for each class). Lastly, it is no surprise that the synthetic experiment achieved
near perfect results since the model had no way to test its performance on ‘in the wild’ images. Comparing the synthetic experiment results to the mixed experiment offers
insight into the possible ways a model trained and tested on purely synthetic data might degrade when brought into a real data scenario.</p>

indicated with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 1.00: both baseline experiments, the augmented stucco experiment, and both synthetic experiments. The two mixed
experiments achieved AUC values of 0.95 and 0.91 for stucco and siding, respectively, which is generally considered quite a good score. Since those ROC curves are positioned

augmentation can increase performance and models trained with synthetic images maintain reasonable results on a manually annotated test dataset. The highest performing
experiments were the synthetic experiment and the baseline siding experiment, achieving a value of 0.98 for all three metrics. Although the confusion matrices differed
slightly, the baseline stucco and augmented stucco experiments achieved the same score of 0.96 for all three metrics. The augmented siding experiment performed slightly
worse than the baseline siding experiment with a value of 0.91 for F1 score and recall (and a value of 0.93 for precision). This further supports the finding that too much
augmentation can degrade performance. Although the mixed experiments had a decrease in metrics, the mixed stucco experiment maintained a reasonable performance with the

when training a model on synthetic images. In terms of overall improvement, this study achieved a higher F1 score, precision, and recall than the state-of-the-art by utilizing
a higher resolution model (Swin Transformer v2 at 384 pixel resolution) and reducing the problem space to three labels (null, other, and a label of interest). This study
achieved a 0.98 weighted F1 score, 0.98 recall, and 0.98 precision on the baseline siding experiment while the state-of-the-art achieved 0.93 macro F1 score, 0.91 recall,
and 0.96 precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Raghu, Bucher and
De Wolf, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. For marginal improvements, it was found that augmenting a dataset with 27% synthetic data (for the ‘stucco’ class) offered a slight
improvement over the baseline. This had the opposite effect when using a dataset with 80% synthetic data (for the siding class). As for the possibility to train a model on
entirely synthetic data, the performance was generally worse than the baseline, but still a reasonable performance with the mixed stucco experiment capturing 91% of true
positives in the confusion matrix, achieving an AUC value of 0.95, and scoring 0.87 for precision and 0.86 for the F1 score and recall. The results from the mixed siding
experiment may have been adversely affected by the size of the dataset (62 samples for test and 248 samples for training); potentially signaling a need to have a larger
dataset when training on synthetic images. The near perfect results of the synthetic experiment show that it is possible to train a model on synthetic images for a new label
set, but demonstrates the value of testing a model on manually annotated images.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h2>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have made it feasible to train image classification models on synthetic images, addressing previous challenges of data scarcity and enabling scalability to a national or global level for façade material identification. In this study, we explored the potential benefits and trade-offs that could be made when using varying amounts of synthetic images for training a classification model, as well as proposed an improvement in
overall performance with a higher resolution model.
The research contributes a novel approach in urban mining for material cadastres by utilizing synthetic images to augment and extend an image classification model for detecting façade materials, offering a potential solution to reduce training dataset development time and address data scarcity challenges while improving current approaches’ performance.
This, of course, comes with caveats: the text-to-image prompts should trigger diversity in the generated images, the model should be
at least 384 pixel resolution, the problem space should be reduced to three labels (null, other, and label of interest), the synthetic training data should be large enough,
and it is worthwhile to still manually annotate a test set to develop an intuition for the types of errors that will happen. The results from this study are limited to replicating GSV images for the study’s specific set of labels and would not necessarily guarantee reasonable performance for synthetic images of building interiors or niche facade materials (such as ceramic tile cladding). Access to a high-performance GPU (an nVidia GeForce RTX 3070 8GB GPU) enabled utilization of the pre-trained Swin Transformer v2 384 pixel resolution model, which may not be possible to train on a CPU alone. Additionally, there could be privacy concerns associated with remotely compiling building material inventories, particularly regarding historical (materials that should not be moved from their location) or high-security façade materials (materials that may reveal structural vulnerabilities).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These limitations indicate future research that could progress the field of urban mining for material cadastres further. While this experiment achieved good results mimicking GSV images, it would not be safe yet to conclude that any type of building image could be replicated with synthetic images. Therefore, it would be valuable for future work to explore applying the workflow to interior office and residential synthetic images. For the resolution of synthetic images, there was a considerable difference in performance when moving from the 192 pixel model to the 384 pixel
model resolution, which begs the question whether generating higher resolution images and training with an even higher resolution model may increase performance further. When generating the synthetic images, a brute-force method was used to separate
irrelevant images from the training set because it was suitable for this use case; however, an automatic filtering method would greatly reduce the time needed to prune the
output of the generative model. Further studies using synthetic images could benefit material cadastre research by unlocking building interior datasets, by increasing performance of image classification models even more, and by reducing the time needed to filter synthetic images. Developing a robust image classification model that has proven reliable performance in detecting building materials in a wide variety of contexts, scales, and building layers would be an important milestone in the goal to develop country-wide material cadastres for reusable demolition and renovation waste.</p>
