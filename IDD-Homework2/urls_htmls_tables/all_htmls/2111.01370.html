<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has attracted much research attention due to its privacy protection in distributed machine learning. However, existing work of federated learning mainly focuses on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which cannot efficiently handle graph data that are popular in many applications. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proposed as one of the most promising techniques for graph learning, but its federated setting has been seldom explored. In this paper, we propose FedGraph for federated graph learning among multiple computing clients, each of which holds a subgraph. FedGraph provides strong graph learning capability across clients by addressing two unique challenges. First, traditional GCN training needs feature data sharing among clients, leading to risk of privacy leakage. FedGraph solves this issue using a novel cross-client convolution operation. The second challenge is high GCN training overhead incurred by large graph size. We propose an intelligent graph sampling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which can automatically converge to the optimal sampling policies that balance training speed and accuracy. We implement FedGraph based on PyTorch and deploy it on a testbed for performance evaluation. The experimental results of four popular datasets demonstrate that FedGraph significantly outperforms existing work by enabling faster convergence to higher accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has shown great promise in enabling collaborative machine learning among distributed devices while preserving their data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. There is a growing amount of research efforts on federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, but they study Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that show superior learning accuracy on image and voice data. However, many applications generate graph data (e.g., social graphs and protein structures) consisting of nodes and edges, and much evidence has shown that CNN cannot efficiently handle graph learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has been proposed to deal with graph learning by a novel graph convolution operation. Different from CNN’s convolution operation that filters a small set of neighboring pixels, a graph convolution operation filters the features of neighboring nodes. Unfortunately, existing work of federated learning mainly focuses on CNN, leaving GCN under explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there are several preliminary research efforts about graph learning on decentralized datasets. Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have studied a vertical federated learning scenario on graphs, where clients maintain the same nodes but with different features and edge types. Similarly, Mei et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> assume that graph structural, features and labels belong to different sources. These works are different from the general setting studied in our paper. Some recent works explore the intersection of graph and federated learning by discussing the effect of Non-I.I.D data distribution in federated graph learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, these works do not consider the inter-graph connections, which is a pervasive phenomenon in the real world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study federated learning on GCN based on graph data distributed among multiple computing clients that do not allow direct data sharing due to privacy protection. Each client has a subgraph with edge connections to the subgraphs held by others. Every graph node is associated with some features that contain private information. For example, medical records in hospitals can be organized as graphs, where each graph node represents a record and its features include personal information (e.g., ages, genders, and occupations) as well as health conditions (e.g., diseases) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. It has been widely recognized that these feature data is privacy-sensitive and they cannot be exposed. Given some nodes with labels, the goal of graph learning is to predict the labels of other nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning on GCN is not a simple extension of its counterpart on CNN because of two unique challenges. First, GCN training involves node feature sharing among clients, leading to the risk of privacy leakage. To exploit graph structure information, the graph convolution operation is designed to aggregate feature data of neighboring nodes. Such an operation would fail if some neighboring nodes are maintained by other clients, who refuse to expose their features. A straightforward solution for privacy protection is to eliminate feature sharing, but it would seriously decrease training accuracy, which has been confirmed by our experimental results. The second challenge is the high training overhead incurred by large graph size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For example, a social network maintained by Facebook contains over 3 billion users, and the corresponding graph data size may be several hundreds of gigabytes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Since a GCN model stacks several layers of the same structure with the original graph, the model size becomes extremely large, even exceeding the physical memory constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedGraph, a federated graph learning system that integrates the ideas of federated learning and GCN to open new opportunities for privacy-preserving distributed graph learning. FedGraph is especially good at learning on distributed graphs with complicated connections, and can converge to a high training accuracy by addressing the above challenges. For the first challenge about the dilemma of feature sharing and privacy protection, a common solution is to use cryptography-based techniques, e.g., homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, to enable computation over encrypted data. Despite strong security guarantee, these techniques have high computational overhead, making them inappropriate choices for FedGraph that pursuits high training speed. There also exist hardware-based solutions, e.g., SGX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, for privacy protection, but security hardware has limited capacity and it cannot handle large graph data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. FedGraph solves the dilemma by designing a cross-client graph convolution operation, without heavy cryptographic operations or dedicated hardware. Instead of directly sharing node features, FedGraph embeds them into low-dimensional representations before sharing, so that original features cannot be recovered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce GCN training overhead, graph sampling has been widely adopted to randomly select a mini-batch of nodes for training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
GraphSAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is a graph sampling method based on node neighboring relationship. It randomly selects a fixed number of neighbors when applying the graph convolution operation for each node. FastGCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> has been proposed to improve sampling efficiency by independently selecting nodes for each graph convolution layer.
However, existing work cannot satisfy the requirements of FedGraph design due to three weaknesses. First, these sampling methods depend on some hand-crafted parameters that rely heavily upon the knowledge of domain experts. For example, the performance of GraphSAGE is determined by the parameter specifying the number of sampled neighbors, and manual parameter tuning is time-consuming.
Second, existing methods ignore the tradeoff between training speed and training accuracy. Sampling fewer nodes accelerates training but decreases accuracy.
Third, clients participating in federated graph learning are heterogeneous in graph size and computational capability. Applying the same sampling policy for all clients is far from the optimal solution.

</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">These weaknesses make the sampling algorithm design challenging in FedGraph. Instead of struggling to improve existing heuristic designs, we resort to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques and design an intelligent sampling algorithm that can automatically adjust sampling policies by jointly considering computation overhead, training accuracy and client heterogeneity. By carefully examining various DRL algorithms, we choose the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and cast it to federated graph learning.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of federated learning is to train a shared model among distributed devices while avoiding the exposure of their training data. A typical federated setting consists of a number of devices, each of which holds a dataset that cannot be exposed to others. In addition, there is a parameter server responsible for synchronizing training results among devices. Federated learning contains multiple training rounds. In each training round, devices first download the latest global model from the parameter server and independently conduct training using their local data. Then, they send updated models or model differences back to the parameter server. After collecting training results from all devices, the parameter server integrates them to create a new global model. During the whole training process, devices share only models and it is almost impossible to infer the training data from these models. Due to the protection for training data, federated learning becomes one of the hottest topics in recent years and many important research efforts have been made to address various challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

Such a sampling guarantees that aggregation of node embeddings always happens among neighboring nodes. A representative work of node-wise neighbor-sampling is GraphSAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, the number of sampled nodes may exponentially increase as more layers are constructed. In addition, Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have pointed out that it incurs redundancy of embedding calculation at some nodes, e.g., the red nodes in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.3 Graph Sampling ‣ 2 Background and Motivation ‣ FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning with Intelligent Sampling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a), which are the shared neighbors of other nodes.
Several recent approaches, e.g., VR-GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Cluster-GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, have been proposed to improve the performance of node-wise neighbor-sampling, but they cannot fundamentally address this weakness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The other kind of approaches is called layer-wise importance-sampling. Its basic idea is to independently sample a fixed number of nodes for each GCN layer based on a sampling probability, which is calculated based on node degrees. FastGCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is a typical approach of layer-wise importance-sampling. However, since nodes of different layers are sampled independently, some sampled nodes may have no connections with the ones in the previous layer, like the blue-marked node shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.3 Graph Sampling ‣ 2 Background and Motivation ‣ FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning with Intelligent Sampling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b).

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We assume that computing clients and the parameter server are <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">honest-but-curious</span>, i.e., they honestly follow the federated learning procedures but want to learn feature information held by others. This is a typical threat model that has been widely used by current federated learning research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Some other more serious threat models are discussed as follows. Some malicious clients can tamper with the training by modifying model parameters sent to the parameter server. To deal with this threat, we can use Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for local training. TEE is commonly available on modern CPUs. It enables an isolated execution environment guaranteed by hardware, and adversaries cannot access data and codes in TEE. Besides, malicious parameter servers can modify global model parameters to compromise federated learning. We can use secure multi-party computation (MPC) or homomorphic encryption (HE) to protect the model aggregation. Besides, TEE can be also used to protect global model aggregation at the parameter server.</p>

We customize the parameter server and clients by adding new modules to implement intelligent sampling. The parameter server contains three main modules. The DDPG-based sampling algorithm generates sampling policies for all clients. A model aggregator collects local feature weights trained by clients and aggregates them to generate new global feature weights for next-round training. In addition, a communication module is designed for message exchanges between the parameter server and clients. This communication module is realized by gRPC APIs, which are based on TCP communication protocol. Each client has a module of GCN construction, responsible for creating a GCN model according to sampling policy. A GCN training module is designed to run the training algorithm.</p>

There are multiple training rounds. In each round, clients download the latest feature weights from the server and construct local GCNs to train these weights. Due to the existence of external edge connections, local GCN training involves embedding sharing among clients. After that, they send updated feature weights to the server, which then creates new global feature weights that will be used for the next-round training. Although FedGraph shares a similar process with traditional federated learning, it has unique procedures of local training and global parameter update, which are presented as follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The GCN construction combines the strength of node-wise sampling and layer-wise sampling. These sampling probabilities are independent, which offers opportunities for fine-grained sampling over layers, like layer-wise sampling. By carefully setting these probabilities, we can avoid the high computational cost incurred by the recursive explosive expansion of the neighborhood. Meanwhile, since the sampling process is based on neighborhood relation, which is similar to node-wise sampling, we can avoid sampling nodes without connections.</p>

The design of <span id="S3.SS2.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GenSampling()</span> is one of the most important contributions of this paper, and it relies on the deep reinforcement learning technique to balance computational overhead and model accuracy.

By sampling fewer nodes, we can accelerate the training process with reduced computational overhead, while lowering training accuracy. On the other hand, with more sampled nodes, we can better approximate the original GCN to achieve higher training accuracy, but incurs a high computational cost. Therefore, it is significant to design sampling policies to make a tradeoff, however, which has been ignored by existing work. Meanwhile, sampling policy design is difficult due to a large optimization space, and manual tuning hardly works in practice. We desire automatic algorithms, with minimum human involvement, to generate good sampling policies.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By carefully examining sampling policies, we find that their influence on the learning performance, in terms of training speed and accuracy, cannot be described using precise closed-form expressions. Instead of struggling with heuristic algorithm design, we resort to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that can automatically approximate a good solution. The idea of DRL can be implemented in various ways, generating a thriving family of algorithms for different application scenarios with different performance. By carefully comparing candidate DRL algorithms, we choose to use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which can efficiently handle the high-dimensional and continuous action space of our problem. DDPG combines Deep Q-Networks and actor-critic approach and thus enjoys their benefits.</p>

It is possible that generated local graphs overlap on some nodes, especially for small graph datasets, like Cora and Citeseer. For large graphs, we carefully control the local graph generation to avoid overlapping. Even some nodes overlap in the synthesized datasets, we treat them as different nodes and there is no influence to training performance. A similar graph synthesis method has been adopted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. For the local dataset, we randomly choose a set of nodes to generate a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
The edge connections across clients are maintained according to the original graph. For local graph learning, each client constructs a 3-layer GCN, including an input layer and two convolutional layers. We set 16 hidden units, 50<math id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> dropout rate, 0.01 learning rate for Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. For Reddit, there are 128 hidden units, the dropout rate is 20%, and the learning rate is 0.0001. We set the batch size as 256 for Cora, Citeseer, and Reddit, 1024 for PubMed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. We use ADAM optimizer for local GCN training.

For a fair comparison, we use physical time, instead of the number of training rounds, as the metric to evaluate training speeds of different schemes. That is because clients have graphs of different sizes, and they consume different time costs in each training round.
Specifically, FedGraph achieves 75% accuracy at about 5 seconds on Cora, but the other three algorithms take more than 10 seconds to achieve similar accuracy. In PubMed, FedGraph takes about 15 seconds to achieve 73% accuracy, but GraphSAGE and full-batch scheme need more than 2 times as long to converge. In the largest datasets Reddit, FedGraph’s advantages are more obvious, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Performance Evaluation ‣ FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning with Intelligent Sampling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(d). We summarize the reasons as follows. GraphSAGE has a serious problem of computation redundancy, which consumes more time for training. FastGCN can not get sufficient embedding information from other clients because some sampled nodes have no edge connections. Full-batch scheme needs to calculate the embeddings of all nodes, which incurs high computational cost especially on larger graphs PubMed and Reddit. FedGraph has well addressed the weaknesses of the above methods and thus achieves higher performance. Note that the total number of training rounds is fixed to 300 and FastGCN completes training earlier because it samples fewer nodes for training.</p>

We consider three heterogeneity levels, and the corresponding variances are 0.1 (low), 0.5 (middle) and 1 (high), respectively. For a better understanding, we calculate the ratio between the smallest graph size and the largest size, and the results are about 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively.
We measure the training time to converge to a target accuracy that can be achieved by most of sampling schemes. In PubMed, we set target accuracy to 72%, but FastGCN can converge to 68.6% only.

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Effect of cross-client embedding sharing.</span> FedGraph uses the cross-client graph convolution operation to enable embedding sharing between clients while hiding local features during local GCN training. For comparison, we consider two alternative methods, one (referred to as FedGraph_allShare ) is to share embeddings from the first layer to maximize the information sharing, and the other (referred to as FedGraph_nonShare) is to discard cross-client sharing to simplify the design. We show the accuracy convergence of these three designs in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Performance Evaluation ‣ FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning with Intelligent Sampling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. The total number of training rounds is set to 300. We can find that the curve of FedGraph is close to that of FedGraph_allShare, which demonstrates that FedGraph has little information loss even though it eliminates the embedding sharing in the first layer. It is because that the high-layer embedding contains information about the original features. Hence, FedGraph can efficiently learn from cross-clients embedding sharing without the original feature exchanging. Simultaneously, FedGraph significantly outperforms FedGraph_nonShare under all datasets. In Cora and Citeseer, cross-client convolution operations can increase training accuracy by about 10%. In PubMed, two designs have similar final accuracy, but FedGraph enables quick convergence. Reddit is more sensitive to cross-client embedding sharing than other datasets, and FedGraph_nonShare converges to an accuracy of about 70%, while FedGraph can converge to about 90%. That is because Reddit has rich edge connections as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 5 Performance Evaluation ‣ FedGraph: Federated Graph Learning with Intelligent Sampling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, and ignoring cross-client edges would seriously break the whole graph structure. Note that FedGraph_nonShare completes 300-round training earlier because it eliminates embedding sharing.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to its excellent performance, GCN has been widely used in many graph learning applications, like node classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, link prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, and recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Recently, several studies have applied GCN in natural language processing tasks, like machine translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and relation classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. In order to accelerate GCN training, NeuGraph <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> has been proposed as a new framework that supports efficient and scalable parallel neural network computation on graphs. NeuGraph can support not only single GPU training, but also parallel processing on multiple GPUs. Scardapane et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have proposed distributed GCN training based on message passing exchanges. However, this work ignores privacy protection, which is necessary for federated learning scenarios. Communication efficiency of federated graph learning has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Graph sampling can effectively reduce GCN training overhead. Hamilton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have proposed GraphSAGE that constructs a simplified GCN by sampling a subset of neighboring nodes. However, GraphSAGE incurs redundant computation at some nodes as common neighbors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Although several works has been proposed to alleviate the redundant computation by reducing the size of sampled nodes, like VR-GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Cluster-GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, they still can not well address this problem when training a very large and deep GCN. To deal with this problem, layer-wise sampling methods, like FastGCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and LADIES <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, have been proposed to sample the nodes for each layer independently, instead of sampling neighbors for each node. This kind of sampling method can efficiently reduce the computation cost, but some sampled nodes may have no connection due to independent sampling, which would degrade training accuracy. In addition, all above sampling methods depend on hand-crafted parameters that need manual tuning. The weaknesses of existing work motivate the FedGraph design with intelligent sampling in this paper.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedGraph as a novel federated graph system to enable privacy-preserving distributed GCN learning. Different from traditional federated learning, FedGraph is more challenging because GCN training process involves embedding sharing among clients. To address this challenge, FedGraph uses a novel cross-client graph convolution operation to compress the embeddings before sharing, so that private information can be well hidden. In addition, to reduce GCN training overhead, FedGraph adopts a DRL-based sampling scheme that can well balance the training speed and accuracy. Experimental results on a 20-client testbed show that FedGraph significantly outperforms existing schemes.</p>
