<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain, requires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome beyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of federated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve difficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning. Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms of organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct and ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To address the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can guard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a trained model with privacy preservation of the task requester’s test data as well as the pool’s submitted model. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain. Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain, disrupting the current centralized models, is heralded as
the next paradigm innovation in digital networks, which opens a door to uncharted cyberspace with ever-increasing security, verifiability and transparency concerns. The performance of Blockchain heavily relies on the adopted consensus mechanisms in terms of
efficiency, consistency, robustness and scalability. The aim of consensus mechanisms is orchestrating the global state machine so as to agree on the order of deterministic events and
screen out invalid events. Undisputedly, the most popular consensus mechanism is PoW, which is adopted by two mainstream Blockchain systems, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">PoW determines accounting rights and rewards through the
competition among nodes (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">miners</span>) to solve a hard cryptographic puzzle by brute-forcing, which is called <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mining</span>, an extremely computation-hungry process. It is reported that the total electricity consumption of Bitcoin is comparable to that of Austria annually; the electricity that a single Bitcoin transaction expends is equal to 22.32 U.S. households powered for one day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The energy-wasting way of PoW deviates from the sustainable and environment-friendly trend for current technology development, thus diluting
its value and hindering its further application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the drawback of PoW, researchers proposed solutions from two different perspectives: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">energy-conservation</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">energy-recycling</span>.
Proof of stake (PoS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and
voting-based consensus algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> are typically energy-conservation approaches. They economize on energy by cutting down the mining difficulty of rich stakeholders or their delegates. Non-democracy is an obvious side effect of these approaches since they have a bias toward wealthy peers. Furthermore, their mining process, even with reduced difficulty, is still considered as waste on useless computation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Energy-recycling consensus algorithms address the energy-wasting issue of PoW from a different angle. They recycle the energy which is originally employed to solve cryptographic puzzles for useful tasks. For instance, the mining energy can be repurposed for finding long prime chains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, matrix computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The idea of energy-recycling consensus algorithms, i.e., turning the meaningless proof of work into practical tasks for completing the consensus of Blockchain, undoubtedly deepens the integration of Blockchain and other fields, expanding the application scope of Blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm: <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">proof of federated learning</span> (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve difficult but meaningless puzzles
in PoW is reinvested to federated learning. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a distributed machine learning approach, with the idea of bringing code to data rather than the reverse direction. In federated learning, a high-quality model maintained by a central server can be learned through aggregating locally-computed updates, which are sent by a loose federation of participating clients. Since the local training dataset of each client will not be sent to the central server, privacy and security risks are significantly reduced.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Besides PoFL can inherit the advantage of energy-recycling consensus algorithms, we propose it also because PoW and federated learning have a natural fit in terms of organization structure. Due to the huge difficulty for individual mining, <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pooled-mining </span> becomes a trend of PoW, where miners join pools, gathering their computational power, to figure out the cryptographic solution and then the pool manager of each pool allocates rewards proportionally to each miner’s contribution. In other words, both pooled-mining and federated learning has a <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clustering</span> structure. Thus, when the cryptographic puzzle in PoW is replaced with federated learning, the cluster head, namely the pool manager, can coordinate the locally-computed results updated by pool members (miners) to form a high-quality model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, the fit of the organization structure does not imply it is non-trivial to realize PoFL. In detail, the merit of federated learning lies in that all clients collaboratively train a high-quality model while keeping their training data private from others, where the usufruct and ownership of local training data is an integration.
However, the openness of Blockchain endows anyone with the right of mining, i.e., the local model training in PoFL, which results in the separation between the data usufruct and ownership. This may lead to data privacy leakage in model training and verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper aims to address the above challenge so that PoFL can meet practical demands. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain, where the main contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">PoFL employs federated learning to solve realistic problems with practical value to achieve consensus in Blockchain. In our proposed PoFL framework, the problems such as image recognition and semantic analysis are published as tasks on a platform by <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">requesters</span>, along with the corresponding rewards as incentives for mining. Considering that the amount of reward can indirectly reflect the importance and urgency of a task, we assume that the platform will choose the task with the highest reward as the current problem which should be solved by miners as a proof-of-work to reach consensus. In the case of multiple tasks with the same highest reward, the platform will select the earliest-arrived one.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, pooled-mining has become a development trend in Blockchain currently, which has a similar organization structure with federated learning. Therefore, we investigate PoFL under the pooled-mining paradigm in this paper, whose framework is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II Framework of PoFL ‣ Proof of Federated Learning: A Novel Energy-recycling Consensus Algorithm" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

This process is named as <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated mining</span>. After accuracy computation with the requester’s test data, each pool manager packages transactions and generates a new block containing the information needed for model verification. Once receiving blocks, full nodes will identify the winner pool through verifying model accuracy. The winner pool should send his model to the requester, thus obtaining the accounting right and the corresponding reward.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, when training data are bought from some data providers, there is a potential risk of privacy leakage due to the separation between the ownership and the usage right of the data.
An intuitive countermeasure is that data providers encrypt their sensitive data and send them to the pool for miners’ training. However, this will make the training time too long, which further impacts the block generation rate and overall performance of Blockchain.
Take the training on the encrypted MNIST dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> as an example. It takes 570.11 seconds to run a single instance using CryptoNets model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>
and nearly 57 hours to train two epochs using CryptoCNN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is not practical to employ encrypted data to train ML models for consensus in Blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the above challenge, we propose a reverse game-based data trading mechanism, which takes advantage of market power to make a rational pool maximize his utility only when he trains the model without any data leakage. The proposed mechanism leverages the reverse game to describe the cooperative and conflictive relationship between the pool and the data provider, which is an efficient tool to explore the solutions for a class of private-information games. The pool also has private information in reality, such as the net profit of pooled-mining and the profit of disclosing data privacy. This information is tightly related to the probability that the pool discloses training data, which will never be told to the data provider. Leveraging on the reverse game theory, the data provider can determine the optimal trading probability and the corresponding price without knowing the private information of the pool, thus preserving the privacy of the training data using the market as a tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In our mechanism, the data trading probability and its purchase price depend on not only the private information of the pool but also his reputation. The reputation of the pool is calculated according to his data privacy disclosure record. In order to establish a credible reputation mechanism, we publish the data trading records between the pool and the data provider on Blockchain. Due to the features of transparency and traceability of Blockchain, once a piece of data is disclosed, the malicious pool can be easily detected and will be accountable for this information leak with a reduced reputation. This further affects the data trading probability and the purchase price of the pool in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The reverse game-based data trading mechanism selects the pool manager as the representative to conduct data trading with data providers. This design is based on two considerations: 1) It can avoid the waste of resources caused by two pool members in the same pool purchasing two copies of the same data; 2) The pool manager is able to have the knowledge of the data amount used for training in the entire pool, so that the amount of training data for each miner can be distributed as evenly as possible, which acts as the cornerstone of the average income allocation after successful mining. Once the data trading process is finished, the data provider directly sends the data to the corresponding miner, which helps avoid the communication overhead and possible privacy leakage risks caused by the pool manager’s transmission<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>Each miner can acquire training data directly from one or more data providers which are assigned by the pool manager according to the data trading contracts, rather than obtain all data from the pool manager who need to collect training data from all data providers.</span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we mentioned above, after each epoch of training, the model accuracy should be calculated based on the test data of the requester. However, on one hand, the test data may be sensitive so that the requester is not willing to share them; on the other hand, the trained model should not be published before the end of consensus competition to avoid being plagiarized by other competitors. To address this challenge, we design a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism to verify the accuracy of the trained model without information disclosure from either the requester or the pool. This mechanism can also be used by full nodes to verify the accuracy of models when receiving blocks from pools.</p>

However, the communication and computation complexity of directly using 2PC is too high, making the efficiency of label prediction relatively low.

The main reason of using 2PC lies in that it is easy to employ a garbled circuit (GC) to describe the label comparison process so that this process can be completed efficiently, since the efficiency of 2PC is closely related to the GC construction in both the communication and computation complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.3" class="ltx_p">The cost of GC is linearly correlated with the number of garbled gates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Taking advantage of the <span id="S4.SS2.p3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">free-XOR</span> technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, XOR can be <span id="S4.SS2.p3.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">free</span>, implying that XOR does not need associated garbled tables
and the corresponding hashing or symmetric key operations. Therefore, a direct way to improve the performance is reducing the number of costly garbled gates, namely those non-XOR gates. In detail, to compare two values, a SUB gate is supposed to be exploited, which is a non-XOR gate. In our scheme, we replace the SUB gate with a combination of an XOR gate and a NOT gate shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-B 2PC-based label comparison ‣ IV Privacy-preserving Model Verification Mechanism ‣ Proof of Federated Learning: A Novel Energy-recycling Consensus Algorithm" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Note that the NOT gate is also free since it can be implemented using an XOR gate with one of the inputs as constant 1. We summarize the number of non-free binary gates of our circuit in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B 2PC-based label comparison ‣ IV Privacy-preserving Model Verification Mechanism ‣ Proof

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When blocks are generated, it comes to the accuracy verification process of full nodes. The time for full nodes to verify accuracy and reach a consensus is very significant. The shorter the time, the better the efficiency and the higher the security.
In our proposed mechanism, the main time spent on verification is accuracy sorting and testing.
The time of sorting is based on the operating speed and the number of blocks. For the operating speed, we take ASIC in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> as an example. Referring to the average sorting time of ASIC, the time consumption increases with the number of models as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-D Accuracy verification ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Proof of Federated Learning: A Novel Energy-recycling Consensus Algorithm" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(a). While for the number of received blocks, according to the statistics of Bitcoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, there are 9,364 nodes at present.
Thus, the time of sorting all the accuracy of received blocks in our system will not exceed 60 microseconds for full nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">After sorting the accuracy of models in a descending order, full nodes test these models from the first one. If the model with the highest accuracy is verified to be true, there is no need to test other models. Otherwise, the second one will be tested until finding the first model with verified accuracy being the same as that stored in the block header. The quantity of our test data is set as 10,000. The average time for full nodes to test the accuracy of models is between 1.65 seconds and 1.7 seconds as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-D Accuracy verification ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Proof of Federated Learning: A Novel Energy-recycling Consensus Algorithm" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(b). In addition to the time of sorting, all the time we need is no more than 2 seconds.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many attempts have been made to find valuable work as a substitute of puzzles in PoW, which should be difficult to solve but easy to verify. Initially, researchers take a small step forward replacing the nonce with some mathematic problems. Primecoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> requires miners to find long prime chains for the proof of work. There are many similar problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, such as orthogonal vectors, all-pairs shortest paths problem and rSUM, which requires to find r numbers to have their sum be zero. However, there is no significant practical value in solving these mathematical problems at the cost of ridiculously
large amounts of energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, more diverse and improved attempts are proposed. In PoX (proof of exercise) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, scientific computation matrix-based problems are sent by employers to a third-party platform where miners select tasks to solve. Permacoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposes PoR (proof of retrievability) to investigate the storage space and memory for a file or file fragment, where the mining is not associated with computation but storage resources. PieceWork <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> reuses the wasted work for additional goals such as spam prevention and DoS mitigation by outsourcing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent, the combination of deep learning and Blockchain has appeared. A substitution of PoW named PoDL (proof of deep learning) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> first uses deep learning for Blockchain maintenance instead of useless hash calculation, which only needs to add some new components to the block header and thus can be applied to the current cryptocurrency systems. However, the user needs to provide a complete training dataset for model training and test datasets for verification to all miners, which sacrifices data privacy and may frustrate the data provider to apply Blockchain. Besides, image segmentation is employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which defines the segmentation model as proof. Furthermore, Coin.AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposes a proof-of-storage scheme to reward users for providing storage for deep learning models.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm named PoFL, where the cryptographic puzzles in PoW is replaced with federated learning tasks. To realize PoFL, a general framework is introduced and a new PoFL block structure is designed for supporting block verification. To guarantee the privacy of training data, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism is proposed, which takes advantage
of market power to make a rational pool maximize his utility
only when he trains the model without any data leakage, thus further motivating pools to behave well. In addition, a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism is designed to verify the accuracy of a trained model while preserving the privacy of the task requester’s test data as well as avoiding the pool’s submitted model to be plagiarized by others, which employs homomorphic encryption and secure two-party computation in label prediction and comparison, respectively. Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PoFL.</p>
