<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) over resource-constrained wireless networks has recently attracted much attention.
However, most existing studies consider one FL task in single-cell wireless networks and ignore the impact of downlink/uplink inter-cell interference on the learning performance.
In this paper, we investigate FL over a multi-cell wireless network, where each cell performs a different FL task and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is adopted to enable fast uplink gradient aggregation.
We conduct convergence analysis of AirComp-assisted FL systems, taking into account the inter-cell interference in both the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions, which reveals that the distorted model/gradient exchanges induce a gap to hinder the convergence of FL.
We characterize the Pareto boundary of the error-induced gap region to quantify the learning performance trade-off among different FL tasks, based on which we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of error-induced gaps in all cells.
To tackle the coupling between the downlink and uplink transmissions as well as the coupling among multiple cells, we propose a cooperative multi-cell FL optimization framework to achieve efficient interference management for downlink and uplink transmission design.
Results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves much better average learning performance over multiple cells than non-cooperative baseline schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications becomes an emerging trend for accelerating the fulfillment of connected intelligence in the 6G wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, a vast amount of raw data generated at the wireless edge stimulates the emergence of various AI applications, such as smart Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, and augmented reality.
Due to the communication-efficiency and privacy-preserving concerns, it is undesirable to transfer raw data from massive edge devices to an edge server, e.g., base station (BS), as in the centralized machine learning (ML) framework.
To this end, federated learning (FL) as one of the promising distributed learning paradigms has recently been proposed to train a common ML model in an iterative manner by exploiting the edge computing power while keeping the raw data at the edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
During each training iteration, multiple edge devices first receive the latest global model broadcast from the edge server, based on which the edge devices compute the local updates with their own datasets.
Subsequently, the edge server aggregates the local updates to refresh the global model for the next training iteration.
The aggregation of local updates therein can be regarded as an implicit information sharing without transmitting the private raw data, which effectively preserves the data privacy.
However, because of the periodic exchange of high-dimensional model/gradient parameters between the edge server and edge devices during the training process, it is mandatory to develop communication-efficient strategies to reduce the communication overhead and accelerate the training process, especially when the radio resources are limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed an upsurge research interest in the joint learning and communication design for FL over wireless networks.
One challenge in realizing such a joint design is the efficient allocation of limited radio resources for high learning performance.
To this end, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> propose to dynamically adapt the frequency of global aggregation to improve the learning performance under a fixed resource budget for the entire training process.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> optimize the resource allocation to balance the trade-off between the training time and the energy consumption.
In addition, various scheduling policies are developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to allocate limited radio bandwidth to a subset of edge devices with good channel conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, large local updates norm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, small transmission delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and low energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, hierarchical FL is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to reduce communication costs and achieve efficient resource allocation.
All the aforementioned studies adopt an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme to achieve uplink model/gradient aggregation, where the edge sever updates the global model after successfully decoding each of the local updates.
The number of resource blocks required by such a “<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">transmit-then-aggregate</span>” strategy linearly scales with the number of participating devices, which can be radio spectrum inefficient, especially when the number of devices is large.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently been leveraged to enhance the communication efficiency of uplink model/gradient aggregation in FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
By exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels, AirComp allows multiple devices to concurrently transmit their local updates over the same radio channel and meanwhile enables the edge server to directly receive an aggregation of these local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Such an “<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregate-when-transmit</span>” strategy requires only one resource block regardless of the number of participating devices.
To achieve accurate model aggregation via AirComp, various transceiver designs have recently been proposed to reduce the distortion of the aggregated model due to the receiver noise and channel fading, such as via multi-antenna beamforming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and transmit power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In addition, auxiliary equipment is leveraged to support reliable uplink model/gradient aggregation, such as intelligent reflecting surface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and half-duplex relay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, thereby improving the learning performance when the propagation environment is unfavorable.
All the aforementioned works assume ideal error-free downlink transmissions and focus on the uplink transmission design.
Due to the random channel fading, the global model disseminated in the downlink inevitably suffers from channel distortion, which in turn detrimentally affects the local training performance at the edge devices.
When the downlink distortion is severe, the previous training may become futile.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To fill this gap, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> develop efficient methods to tackle non-ideal downlink model dissemination in wireless FL systems.
In particular, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> show that, by adopting the analog downlink transmission, the adverse impact on the learning performance caused by the devices with less accurate model estimates can be alleviated by those with more accurate model estimates.
The convergence of FL over noisy downlink and uplink wireless channels is investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, which takes into account full and partial device participation, uplink model and model differential transmission, and non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) local datasets.
Results show that the effect of both downlink and uplink communication errors can be alleviated during the training process as long as they do not dominate the errors caused by stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
In addition, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> consider a unit-modulus AirComp-assisted FL system, where a phase-shift network at the edge server is utilized to reduce the parameter distortion caused by both the downlink and uplink communication errors.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned studies develop efficient joint learning and communication designs considering one FL task in a single-cell wireless network.
With the rapid advancement in connected intelligence, the co-existence of multiple FL tasks in a multi-cell wireless network will become a new normal in future wireless networks.
Under this circumstance, the inter-cell interference among different FL tasks needs to be considered, as it is the main performance-limiting factor of multi-cell wireless networks.
A few recent studies have given some preliminary discussions about the impact of inter-cell interference on device scheduling and resource allocation in wireless FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
These studies focus on inter-cell interference in the uplink aggregation.
Different from the existing studies in the literature, in this paper we study multiple FL tasks over multi-cell wireless networks, while taking into account the inter-cell interference in both the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions.
Furthermore, we investigate the learning performance in multiple cells, extending the existing studies focusing only on a typical cell.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider over-the-air FL in a multi-cell wireless network, where each cell performs a different FL task and the devices in each cell upload local gradients to their home BS using AirComp.
We consider a practical yet challenging scenario with universal frequency reuse, where both the downlink and uplink transmissions during the training process in each cell are distorted by the receiver noise, channel fading, and inter-cell interference.
To achieve maximal learning performance for all cells, it is necessary to effectively manage inter-cell interference during both the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions, which introduces the following challenges.
First, the main objective of FL is to enable low-latency and high-quality intelligence distillation from edge devices. However, there does not exist a widely-accepted performance metric that can characterize the learning performance as a function of communication system parameters.
Second, considering both the downlink and uplink model/gradient distortion significantly complicates the learning performance characterization.
This is because the local gradient computation depends on the distortion of the downlink model transmission, while the global model update also depends on the distortion of the uplink gradient transmission.
Third, due to the inter-cell interference, the transmission processes in different cells are coupled and hence simply focusing on single-cell optimization may deteriorate the learning performance in other cells, which makes it challenging to coordinate the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions in different cells.
To address these challenges, we develop a cooperative optimization framework to balance the learning performance of different FL tasks in a multi-cell wireless network.

Assume that each device is able to accurately estimate the channels between itself and all the BSs through downlink pilot signaling, and each BS can obtain the local channel state information (CSI) of its associated devices through uplink feedback <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
The channel gain of each link is invariant within one coherence time block but independently changes from one block to another.
Each round consists of one downlink transmission block and one uplink transmission block, where each transmission block can accommodate the transmission of an entire model/gradient parameter.
The communication protocol designed in the following focuses on the transmission of one typical dimension of the parameters, which can be extended to the scenarios where multiple blocks are required for transmitting high-dimensional model/gradient parameters.
Note that, when the dimension of the model/gradient parameter is quite large, the compression techniques can be leveraged to enable the parameters to be transmitted in one coherence block <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

On such a boundary, we can only reduce one cell’s error-induced gap at the cost of increasing the error-induced gap of the other cell.
Here, we leverage the profiling technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> to characterize the Pareto boundary by coordinating all BSs to minimize the sum of error-induced gaps of all cells.

Specifically, the IT technique allows the inter-cell interference term to be replaced by a constant, namely IT level, which enables each cell to optimize its transmission regardless of the transmission of other cells.
The IT constraints should be considered in the optimization to ensure that the inter-cell interference does not exceed the IT level.
Meanwhile, each BS merely needs to obtain the CSI of its home cell, which reduces the overhead for collecting the CSI of other cells.
The distributed optimization algorithm is left for our future work.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Figs. <a href="#S5.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-B1 Two-Cell Network ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Interference Management for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Cell Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-B1 Two-Cell Network ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Interference Management for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Cell Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> show the learning performance versus the number of rounds for different uplink transmission schemes when the downlink model dissemination is error-free.
It is observed that <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Opt</span> performs similarly to <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Benchmark</span> in terms of the training loss and test accuracy, which demonstrates that our proposed cooperative uplink transmission is capable of balancing the uplink aggregation errors between two cells, while keeping near-optimal learning performance.
Different from the downlink model dissemination, the transmission design in the uplink gradient aggregation needs to achieve the magnitude alignment at the receiver while suppressing the inter-cell interference for accomplishing the desired function computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Since <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-IgnInter</span> ignores the inter-cell interference and <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-MaxInter</span> assumes a maximum inter-cell interference, they achieve less accurate power control than <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Opt</span>, which results in larger distortion of the aggregated local gradients at the BS and in turn leads to worse learning performance in both cells.
Due to the negligence of inter-cell interference, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-IgnInter</span> suffers from severe inter-cell interference during the training process.
As channel conditions independently change over different communication rounds, the inter-cell interference may vary dramatically in different rounds, which leads to large fluctuations in the training loss of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-IgnInter</span>.
Meanwhile, since the worst effect of inter-cell interference is considered, <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-MaxInter</span> yields a relatively smooth curve as compared with <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-IgnInter</span>.
Due to the lack of power control, the magnitude alignment of uplink local gradients achieved by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Full</span> is completely dependent on the receiver noise, channel fading, and inter-cell interference, which leads to much worse learning performance than other baseline schemes.
Meanwhile, due to the randomness of the receiver noise and channel fading, the FL training using <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Full</span> is not guaranteed to converge.
This results in that some experiments yield an increasing training loss and a non-increasing test accuracy, while others yield slightly decreasing training loss and increasing test accuracy.
Consequently, by averaging the simulation results over <math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="100" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">100</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">100</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1c">100</annotation></semantics></math> experiments, the training loss of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Full</span> shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-B1 Two-Cell Network ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Interference Management for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Cell Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> increases, instead of decreasing as other baseline schemes, while the test accuracy of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UL-Full</span> shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-B1 Two-Cell Network ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Interference Management for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Cell Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> can still increase.</p>

It is observed that all the baseline schemes that consider unreliable wireless communications lie within the achievable regions of training loss and test accuracy.
The <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DL-Opt &amp; UL-Opt</span> achieves the learning performance closest to <span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Benchmark</span> as compared with other baseline schemes that lack interference management in either downlink or uplink transmission.
The results indicate that the interference management is required for both the downlink and uplink transmissions to balance the FL performance among multiple cells.</p>

This demonstrates that our proposed cooperative transmission design is effective in a multi-cell wireless network and can balance the learning performance.
As the number of rounds increases, the learning performance of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DL-Opt &amp; UL-MaxInter</span> gradually approaches and even exceeds the learning performance of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DL-Opt &amp; UL-IgnInter</span>.
Hence, the inter-cell interference gradually becomes a major factor limiting the performance improvement, which demonstrates the importance of interference management in multi-cell wireless networks.
Also, since the performance of <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DL-Opt &amp; UL-IgnInter</span> is mainly limited by the uplink transmission, a phenomenon similar to <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DL-Free &amp; UL-IgnInter</span> is also observed in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B2 Multi-Cell Network ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Interference Management for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Cell Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, i.e., ignoring the inter-cell interference in the upink transmission leads to relatively large fluctuations in the training loss.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider over-the-air FL in a multi-cell wireless network, where each cell performs a different FL task.
To quantify the learning performance, we first conduct the convergence analysis of AirComp-assisted FL systems, which reveals that the distorted downlink and uplink communications result in a gap that hinders the convergence of FL.
We then characterize the Pareto boundary of the gap region via the profiling technique and further formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of error-induced gaps for all cells.
Subsequently, we propose a cooperative multi-cell FL optimization framework to achieve efficient interference management in the downlink and uplink transmissions.
Benefiting from the coordination among multiple cells, our proposed algorithm is able to achieve much better average learning performance than non-cooperative baseline schemes.</p>
