<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">We present <em id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Cross-Client Label Propagation (XCLP)</em>, a new method
for transductive and semi-supervised federated learning.
XCLP estimates a data graph jointly from the data of multiple clients
and computes labels for the unlabeled data by propagating label information
across the graph.
To avoid clients having to share their data with anyone, XCLP employs two cryptographically secure protocols:
<em id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">secure Hamming distance computation</em> and <em id="id7.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">secure summation</em>.
We demonstrate two distinct applications of XCLP within federated learning.
In the first, we use it in a one-shot way to predict labels for
unseen test points. In the second, we use it to repeatedly
pseudo-label unlabeled training data in a federated semi-supervised
setting.
Experiments on both real federated and standard benchmark datasets
show that in both applications XCLP achieves higher classification
accuracy than alternative approaches.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a machine learning paradigm in
which multiple clients, each owning their own data, cooperate to jointly solve a learning task.
The process is typically coordinated by a central server.
The defining restriction of FL is that client data must remain on device
and cannot be shared with either the server or other clients.
In practice this is usually not due to the server being viewed as a hostile
party but rather to comply with external privacy and legal constraints that
require client data to remain stored on-device.
To date, the vast majority of research within FL has been focused
on the supervised setting, in which client data is fully
labeled and the goal is to train a predictive model.
In this setting a well-defined template has emerged: first proposed
as <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated averaging</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, this consists of
alternating between local model training at the clients and model aggregation at the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in many real-world settings fully labeled data may not be available. For instance, in <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cross-device</em> FL, smartphone users are not likely to be interested in annotating more than a handful of the photos on their devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Song et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Similarly, in a <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</em> setting the labeling of medical imaging data may be both costly and time consuming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dehaene et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
As such, in recent years there has been growing interest in developing algorithms that can learn from partly labeled or fully unlabeled data in a federated setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
For such algorithms it can be beneficial, or even essential, to go beyond the standard federated framework of
model-centric learning and develop techniques that directly leverage client data interactions.
Examples include federated clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dennis et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and dimensionality reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Grammenos et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>,
where clients compute statistics based on their data and the server computes with aggregates of these statistics.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contribution</span>  In this work we propose <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Cross-Client Label Propagation (XCLP)</em> which follows a data-centric approach.
XCLP allows multiple clients, each with labeled and unlabeled data, to cooperatively compute labels for their
unlabeled data. This is done using a transductive approach, where the goal is label inference restricted to some
predefined set of unlabeled examples. In particular this approach does not require a model to be trained in order
to infer labels.
Specifically, XCLP takes a graph-based approach to directly assign labels to the unlabeled data.
It builds a joint data graph of a group of clients and propagates the clients’ label information along the edges.
Naively, this approach would require the clients to centrally share their data.
That, however, would violate the constraints of federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">XCLP allows for multiple clients to jointly infer labels from a cross-client data graph <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">without</em> them having to share their data. We refer to this privacy guarantee, in which a client’s data never leaves their
own device, as data confidentiality.
To achieve this XCLP exploits the modular and distributed nature of the problem. It uses locality-sensitive hashing and secure Hamming distance computation to efficiently estimate the cross-client data graph.
It then distributes the label propagation computation across clients and aggregates the results using a customized variant of <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">secure summation</span>.
The key benefits of this approach are:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">XCLP enables the data of multiple clients to be leveraged when estimating the graph and propagating labels.
This is beneficial as the prediction quality of label propagation increases substantially when more data is used.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">XCLP is communication efficient as it does not require training a model over multiple communication
rounds but requires only a single round of communication.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">As a technique to transfer label information from labeled to unlabeled points, XCLP is versatile enough to be used in a variety of contexts.
We illustrate this by providing two applications within federated learning.
In the first we employ XCLP purely for making predictions at inference time. We demonstrate empirically on a real-world, highly heterogeneous, federated medical image dataset that XCLP is able to assign high quality labels to unlabeled data. When all clients are partly labeled we observe XCLP to outperform purely local label propagation, which illustrates the benefits of leveraging more data. XCLP also obtains strong results when using fully labeled clients to infer labels on different, fully unlabeled clients, even when these clients have very different data distributions. In both these scenarios we find that running XCLP on features obtained from models trained using <em id="S1.p4.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</em> gives significantly better accuracy than purely using the model predictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the second application we tackle the problem of federated semi-supervised learning. In this scenario clients possess only partly labeled data and the goal is to train a classifier by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled client data. In this setting we employ XCLP in the training process by integrating it into a standard federated learning pipeline. Specifically, during each round of <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</em> we use XCLP to assign pseudo-labels and weights to the unlabeled data of the current batch of clients. These are then used to train with a weighted supervised loss function.
Our experiments show that this pseudo-labelling approach outperforms all existing methods for federated semi-supervised learning, as well as a range of natural baselines in the standard federated CIFAR-10 benchmark.
Going beyond prior work, we also evaluate on more challenging datasets, namely CIFAR-100 and Mini-ImageNet, where we also observe substantial improvements in accuracy.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning</span>  Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> was originally proposed for learning on
private fully labeled data split across multiple clients.
For a survey on developments in the field see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
A number of recent works propose federated learning in the absence of fully labeled data.
Methods for cluster analysis and dimensionality
reduction have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dennis et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Grammenos et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, in which the server
acts on aggregates of the client data, as opposed to client models.
Other works have focused on a model based approach to federated semi-supervised learning (SSL).
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Jeong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> propose inter-client consistency and parameter decomposition to separately learn from labeled and unlabeled data.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Long et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> apply consistency locally through client based teacher models.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Liang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> combine local semi-supervised training with an enhanced aggregation scheme which re-weights client models based on their distance from the mean model.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> focus on a setting in which the
server has access to labeled data. In this setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite> combine local consistency with grouping of client
updates to reduce gradient diversity while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> combine consistency, through strong data augmentation, with pseudo-labeling unlabeled client data.
Our approach to federated SSL is to iteratively apply XCLP to pseudo-label unlabeled client data. This approach differs from prior work by making use of data interactions between multiple clients to propagate label information over a cross client data graph.
Related to this idea is the notion of federated learning on graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; Xie et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. However, these works are primarily interested in learning from data that is already a graph. In contrast XCLP estimates a graph based on similarities between data points, in order to spread label information over the edges.</p>

Our goal is to assign labels to the unlabeled data points, i.e.<span id="S3.p3.14.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, <em id="S3.p3.14.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">transductive learning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vapnik, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">1982</a>)</cite>.
The process is coordinated by a central server, which we
assume to be <em id="S3.p3.14.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-hostile</em>.
That means, we trust the server to operate on non-revealing
aggregate data and to return correct results of computations.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In particular we exclude <em id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">malicious</em> servers in the cryptographic sense that would, e.g.<span id="footnote1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, be
allowed to employ attacks such as model poisoning or generating
fake clients in order to break the protocol.</span></span></span>
At the same time, we treat clients and server as <em id="S3.p3.14.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">curious</em>,
i.e.<span id="S3.p3.14.6" class="ltx_text"></span>, we want to prevent that at any point in the process
any client’s data is revealed to the server, or to any other client.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our main contribution in this work is, <em id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Cross-Client Label Propagation (XCLP)</em>,
an algorithm for assigning labels to the unlabeled data points. XCLP works
by propagating label information across a neighborhood graph that is built jointly
from the data of all participating clients without revealing their data.
Before explaining the individual steps in detail,
we provide a high level overview of the method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">XCLP consists of three phases:
1) the clients jointly compute similarity values between
all of their data points and transfer them to the server,
2) the server uses these similarities to construct a neighborhood graph and
infers an influence matrix from this, which it distributes
back to the clients,
3) the clients locally compute how their data influences
others, aggregate this information, and infer labels for
their data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The key challenge is how to do these steps without
the clients having to share their data and labels with each
other or with the server.
XCLP manages this by formulating the problem in a
way that allows us to use only light-weight cryptographic
protocols for the steps of computing similarities and
aggregating label information.</p>

Note that cryptographic protocols operate most efficiently on
binary vectors, and Hamming distance is particularly simple
to compute. In fact, this is the reason why we transform
the data using LSH in the first place.

Homomorphic encryption is a framework that allows
computing functions on encrypted arguments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
The outcome is an encryption of the value that would have
been the result of evaluating the target function on the
plaintext arguments, but the computational devices gain
no information about the actual plaintext.
<em id="S3.SS2.p13.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Fully homomorphic encryption(FHE)</em>, which allows
arbitrary functions to be computed this way, is not
efficient enough for practical usage so far <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang &amp; Ju, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
However, efficient implementation exist for
the setting where cyphertexts only have to be

one-shot way to infer labels at prediction time.
In <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 XCLP for federated semi-supervised learning ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Cross-client Label Propagation for Transductive and Semi-Supervised Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a> we show how XCLP can be used for federated
semi-supervised learning by integrating it into a federated averaging
training loop.
As our emphasis here is on accuracy, not real-world efficiency, we
use a simulated setting of federated learning, rather than physically
distributing the clients across multiple devices.
Therefore, we also use plaintext placeholders for the cryptographic
steps that have identical output.

classification of medical images. It consists of a total of 23247 images across 6 clients.
The dataset is highly heterogeneous in terms of the amount of data per client,
the classes present at each client as well as visual content of the images.
As baseline classifier, we follow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ogier du Terrail et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and use an EfficientNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan &amp; Le, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>,
pretrained on ImageNet, which we finetune using federated averaging.

which all clients contribute fully-labeled training data and have
new data that should be classified.
The left columns (“pretrained") illustrate the one-shot setting:
no network training is required, only features are extracted once
using a pretrained network, and XCLP is run once to infer labels.
XCLP performs better than per-client label propagation here, except
for the largest dataset size, indicating that in the limited data regime,
it is indeed beneficial to build the data graph jointly from all data rather
than separately on each clients.
The other three columns (“finetuned") illustrate that with a better
–task-adapted– feature representation, XCLP still outperforms
per-client LP, and also achieves better accuracy than predicting
labels using only the network.</p>

setting. We adopt a leave-one-client-out setup in which one client
does not contribute labeled training but instead its data is meant to be
classified.
Given the heterogeneity of the clients, this means the classifiers have to
overcome a substantial distribution shift.
XCLP achieves better results than a network trained by federated
averaging in all but one case, where in several cases the advantage
is quite substantial.
Note that per-client LP is not applicable here, as the new data
is all located on a client that does not have labeled training
data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We compare FedAvg+XCLP to a broad range of other methods.
To enable a fair comparison of results, all methods use
the same network architecture, and hyper-parameters are

and <em id="S4.SS2.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedSem+</em>, which follows <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Albaseer et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> but
additionally uses confidence-based sample weights, as
we found these to consistently improve its accuracy.
Additional baselines are two methods that follow the same
structure as <a href="#alg2" title="In 4.1 XCLP for prediction ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Cross-client Label Propagation for Transductive and Semi-Supervised Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> but use alternative ways
to obtain pseudo-labels: from per-client label propagation
(FedAvg+perclientLP) or from the network’s classifier
predictions (FedAvg+network).
Finally, we also report results for training in a
supervised manner on only the available labeled
examples, <em id="S4.SS2.p7.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedAvg (labeled only)</em>.
Note that we do not include comparisons to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al.

Across the board, XCLP achieves the best results among all methods,
while of the other methods, none has a consistent advantage over the others.
In addition to these general observations the results offer a number of more specific insights.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p9" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, in nearly all cases semi-supervised methods outperformed the labeled only FedAvg baseline. This is to be expected given the additional (unlabeled) data available to the SSL methods. A notable exception to this, however, is FedAvg + perclientLP in the non-i.i.d.<span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> scenario. In this case in three of the four cases perclient-LP actually degraded the performance of the initial supervised model, which caused automatic model selection to deactivate it. A likely reason for this poor performance is the presence of classes in the client test data which do not appear in the labeled portion of the clients training data. In this situation perclient-LP is not able to predict for these classes on the test data. In contrast XCLP is unlikely to be affected by this issue, as more clients are pooled together and hence more classes are present in the labeled training data. This is reflected in the strong performance of FedAvg + XCLP in the non-i.i.d.<span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p10" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, we observe that the biggest gains from incorporating XCLP occur in the regime where little labeled data is available. In particular we see that with ample labeled data available per client, in the i.i.d.<span id="S4.SS2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> settings, perclientLP performs not so much worse than XCLP. This is to be expected as when each client already has ample labels available then the potential gain of collaboration with other clients is of course lower.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we introduced XCLP, a method for transductively predicting
labels for unlabeled data points in a federated setting, where
the data is distributed across multiple clients.
It makes use of cryptographic routines to preserve data confidentiality
when estimating a joint neighborhood graph over the data and
propagates label information across this graph by distributing
the computation among the clients.
We presented two applications of XCLP, inferring labels for new (test)
data, and training on partly labeled data in a federated semi-supervised
setting.
In our experiments XCLP led to substantial improvements in
classification accuracy in both applications, especially in the
most challenging (but often realistic) setting when the amount
of labeled data per client is limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">XCLP ensures that a client’s data remains anonymous, in the
sense that it is not directly exposed to or shared with any other
party, a notion of privacy we referred to as data confidentiality. This is achieved through the guarantees provided by the cyryptographic subroutines.
While data confidentiality is a fundamental building block of private machine learning paradigms, such as
federated learning, on its own it does not guarantee
that nothing can be learned about the clients or their data.
Indeed it is common practice in private machine learning
to combine data confidentiality with other notions of
privacy, such as differential privacy, in order to obtain
stronger privacy guarantees.
Extending XCLP to integrate such notions of privacy is an interesting direction for future work.</p>

The task is to predict melanoma (cancer) types. There are 6 clients, naturally defined by hospital and scanner used. As a result the data of each client is highly heterogeneous in terms of the amount of data per client (12413, 3954, 3363, 2259,
819, 439 examples for each client respectively), the classes present at each client as well as visual content of the images. Due to the class imbalance in the dataset the evaluation metric used is balanced accuracy.</p>
