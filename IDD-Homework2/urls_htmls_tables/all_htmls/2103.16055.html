<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and analyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the air, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog aggregation transmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we theoretically analyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL over the air. Our theoretical results reveal the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise.
Then, we formulate 1-bit CS based FL over the air as a joint optimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through joint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency. </p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Centralized machine learning (ML) that collects distribute data from edge devices (local workers) to a parameter server (PS) for data analysis and inference is becoming increasingly costly for communications. Although the adoption of approximate data aggregation instead of exact data aggregation proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> can effectively reduce communication costs, the privacy issues exposed by data collection cannot be ignored.
As an alternative, federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that enables many local workers to collaboratively train a common learning model under the coordination of a PS in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In each round of iteration-based FL, starting from a common learning model received from the PS, local devices (workers) proceed to train the model with their own local data by updating their local model parameters, and then transmit their local updates to the PS. Next, all the collected local updates are averaged at the PS and then sent back to local workers for the next round local updates. Without exchanging raw datasets during the iterations between the PS and local workers, FL offers distinct advantages on protecting user privacy and leveraging distributed on-device computation compared to traditional learning at a centralized data center.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, updates shared between local workers and the PS can be extremely large, e.g., the VGGNet architecture has approximately 138 million parameters. As a result, the pre-processing of updates has been considered in the literature to reduce the communication load per worker,
such as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sparsification</em>, <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">quantization</em> and <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication censoring</em> schemes. Given the compressible nature of gradients where only a small percentage of entries have large values while the rest remain at relatively small values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sparsification</em> schemes only keep the large values of local updates to reduce the communication load<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. <em id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Quantization</em> is to compress the continuous-valued update information to a few finite bits so that it can be effectively communicated over a digital channel<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. <em id="S1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Communication censoring</em> is to evaluate the importance of each update in order to avoid less informative transmissions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. All these useful strategies are investigated predominantly for FL with digital communications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the communication overhead and transmission latency of FL over digital communication channels are still proportional to the number of active workers, and thus cannot be applicable in large-scale environments. To overcome this problem, an analog aggregation model is recently proposed for FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> by allowing multiple workers to simultaneously transmit their updates over the same time-frequency resources and then applying an average-enabled computation-over-the-air principle<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It benefits from the fact that FL only relies on the averaged value of distributed local updates rather than their individual values. Exploiting the waveform superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel (MAC), analog aggregation automatically enables to directly obtain the averaged updates required by FL, which prompts the prosperity of analog aggregation based FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a broadband analog aggregation scheme was designed for FL, in which a set of tradeoffs between communication and learning are derived for broadband power control and device scheduling, where the learning metric is set as the fraction of scheduled devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a jointly optimization was proposed to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the aggregated signal. Similarly, a joint design of device scheduling and beamforming was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> for FL over
the air in multiple antenna systems, which aims to maximize the number of selected workers under the given MSE requirements. Based on one-bit gradient quantization, a digital version of broadband over-the-air aggregation was proposed, and the effects of wireless channel hostilities on the convergence rate was analyzed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the gradient sparsification, and a random linear projection for dimensionality reduction of large-size gradient in narrow-band channels was considered to reduce the communication requirements. The power allocation scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> scales the power of the vectors containing the gradient information of different
devices to satisfy the average power constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the prior work, some fundamental questions remain unanswered, which however prevent from achieving communication-efficient and high-performance FL with analog aggregation.
Firstly, the quantitative relationship between FL and analog aggregation communication is not clear. Simple maximization of the number of participated workers is learning-agnostic and hence not necessarily optimal, which decouples the optimization of computation and communication, e.g., the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Secondly, to facilitate power control, most existing works are developed based on a strong assumption that the signals to be transmitted from local workers, i.e., local gradients, can be normalized to have zero mean and unit variance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, gradient statistics in FL vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are unknown a priori<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Thus, it is infeasible to design an optimal power control without prior knowledge of the local gradients at the PS, especially for the non-coding linear analog modulation in analog aggregation based FL. Thirdly, sparsification is introduced for communication efficiency in analog aggregation based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> as a means of lossy compression of local gradients, which may introduce aggregation errors, but the impact of these aggregation errors on FL is not yet clear let alone how to alleviate their side effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we introduce 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) for efficient FL over the air, by developing an optimized practical worker selection and power control policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce 1-bit CS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> into FL over the air for high communication efficiency, where both the dimension of local gradients and the number of quantization bits can be reduced significantly.
Further, thanks to the 1-bit quantization, our power control becomes feasible since it hinges on the quantized values of known magnitude, without relying on any prior knowledge or assumptions on gradient statistics or specific distribution.
More importantly, our work provides an essential interpretation on the relationship between FL and analog aggregation with 1-bit CS techniques to enable joint optimization of computation and communications. Our main contributions are outlined below:</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the scenarios of FL applied over large-scale networks and for training a high-dimensional model parameters, the transmissions between the PS and local workers consume a lot of communication resources and cause training latency. Meanwhile, due to the transmit power and bandwidth limitations posed by practical wireless communications, the digital communication approach of transmitting and reconstructing all the gradient entries one-by-one in an individual manner is an overkill. Thus, in order to reduce the transmission overhead and speed up communication time, we propose to apply 1-bit compressive sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> in FL over the air,
which is motivated by two facts.
One is that the gradients involved in large-size learning problems usually turn out to be compressible with only a small number of entries having significant values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The other is that FL is usually running in an averaged-based distributed learning mechanism.
In our work, through gradient sparsification, the compression nature of CS allows to reduce the dimension of the transmitted gradient vectors. Meanwhile, analog aggregation enables all local workers to simultaneously use the same time-frequency resources to transmit their updates to the PS. Further, the 1-bit quantization not only minimizes the quantization overhead, but also circumvents the unrealistic requirement on known distribution of local gradients. The procedure of the proposed 1-bit CS method for FL is elaborated next.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies a communication-efficient FL based on 1-bit CS and analog aggregation transmissions. A closed-form expression is derived for the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm. This theoretical result reveals the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise. Guided by this revelation, a joint
optimization problem of communication and learning is developed to mitigate aggregation errors, which results in an optimal worker selection and power control. An enumeration-based method and an ADMM method are proposed to solve this challenging non-convex problem, which can obtain the optimal solution for small-scale networks and sub-optimal solution for large-scale networks, respectively. Simulation results show that our proposed FL can greatly improve communication efficiency while ensuring desired learning performance.</p>
