<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Sixth-generation wireless communication (6G) will be an integrated architecture of ”space, air, ground and sea”. One of the most difficult part of this architecture is the underwater information acquisition which need to transmitt information cross the interface between water and air.
In this senario, ocean of things (OoT) will play an important role, because it can serve as a hub connecting Internet of things (IoT) and Internet of underwater things (IoUT). OoT device not only can collect data through underwater methods, but also can utilize radio frequence over the air. For underwater communications, underwater acoustic communications (UWA COMMs) is the most effective way for OoT devices to exchange information, but it is always tormented by doppler shift and synchronization errors. In this paper, in order to overcome UWA tough conditions, a deep neural networks based receiver for underwater acoustic chirp communication, called C-DNN, is proposed. Moreover, to improve the performance of DL-model and solve the problem of model generalization, we also proposed a novel federated meta learning (FML) enhanced acoustic radio cooperative (ARC) framework, dubbed ARC/FML, to do transfer. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FML in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling ratio, local epoch and the data amount on a single node.
From our analysis and simulation results, it is shown that, the proposed C-DNN can provide a better BER performance and lower complexity than classical matched filter (MF) in underwater acoustic communications scenario. The ARC/FML framework has good convergence under a variety of channels than federated learning (FL). In summary, the proposed ARC/FML for OoT is a promising scheme for information exchange across water and air.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the continuous developmenting of the blue economy, the communications for marine information gathering, transmission and fusion will become more and more important<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, sixth-generation (6G) agenda aims to connect the whole world together, which needs to ensure worldwide connectivity. The demand of commnunications will expand from space to air, ground, and sea environment in this era, dramatically<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Hence, underwater information acquisition is becoming increasingly important. Underwater acoustic communication (UWA COMMs) as the most effective way of underwater information transmission has two challenges to face.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One challenge is underwater information need cross the water-air interface.
Fortunately, using buoy node to exchange seabed observation information with satellite control information is a very typical and extremely important application for ocean observation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
The emerging ocean of things (OoT) based on low-cost floating devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, will provide a feasible way for water and air information interaction.
Therefore, OoT will be the hub of information interaction, linking IoT, which is for wireless devices and IoUT which is mainly focusing on underwater equipment<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge is that UWA COMMs need overcome many obstacles, such as strong noise interference, multipath effects, large scale Doppler effects and synchronization error<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The UWA COMMs can be divided into two research fields, high rate communication system and low rate robust communication system.
Especially, the robust UWA COMMs play an important role in many underwater scenarios, such as control signaling transmission for unmanned underwater work system and information interaction in a high-noise environment.
Recently, deep learning has shown amazing results in solving underwater acoustic signal recovery than classical signal processing method. However, the fatal problem is that devices are distributed and may have insufficient data in single node.
Hence, there are two important problems that can’t be ignored. First, data is separated which lead to the marginalization and discretization of data acquisition. Second, single device may have insufficient data.
The emerging federated learning (FL) can train deep learning (DL) models in distributed systems which is a good solution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by above mentioned, we explore the power of deep learning and exploit the cooperation of acoustic and radio links to use distributed data to achieve robust UWA COMMs and utilize distributed data. The surface relay buoy transmission system can utilize the cooperation of acoustic and radio. First, the system can realize information interaction with the subsea equipments through DL based UWA COMMs. Second, the sea surface relay buoy can do federated learning to share DL model parameters via radio frequence in order to improve single node performance. In this paper, the main contribution can be divided into three parts.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">UWA COMMs:</span> UWA characteristics are now known the disadvantages of severe transmission loss, time-varying multi-path propagation, severe Doppler spread, limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, and high propagation delay<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. These features will change as the communication scenario changes. Therefore, researchers usually divide underwater acoustic communication into two kinds according to application requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. One is high-data-rate underwater acoustic communication for short- and medium-range communications. In this direction,in order to further improve the communication reliability, it is necessary to better overcome the complex multi-path fading of underwater acoustic channel. The joint equalization decoding method, which combines channel equalization and channel decoding, is a relatively advanced channel compensation technology at present and has high practical value and application prospect<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in order to meet the needs of more diversified applications with high data rate, new efficient modulation mode and multiple input multiple output technology are introduced into the medium and short range underwater acoustic communication, which significantly improves the rate of underwater acoustic communication and becomes a new research hotspot<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
The other is low-data-rate underwater acoustic communication for long-range communications. Many modulation techniques which have robust performance, such as frequence shift keying, chirp modulation and spread modulation, have been used for rapid timevarying channels.
However, the most difficult aspect of UWA COMMs is lack of a accurate channel models
the tractable mathematical descriptions of the underwater acoustic channel are elusive, because the signal propagation is very complicated<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Hence, researchers pay more attention to data based deep learning method expecting to solve many problems that traditional methods cannot.
With the improving computational resources and the quantity of data, deep learning brings a new era for communication system that many novel system architecture and algorithm are designed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DL Based COMMs:</span>
DL has been applied successfully in receiver design, channel estimation and signal detection over wireless channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Unlike conventional receivers, DL can handle wireless channels in an end-to-end manner. It is widely acknowledged that the well-trained DL-receiver can not only reduce the receiver complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, but also achieve perfect demodulation under unknown channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
The design of DL-receivers can be generally classified into two categories. One is the data driven method, such as the classical FC-DNN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which takes into account the characteristics of data and the ability of neural networks, aiming to achieve global optimality. Whereas, most existing works based on the data-driven method consider the communication system as a black box. The other category is the model driven method, such as the well-known ComNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which combines DL and expert knowledge.
In especial, some methods based on deep learning are also gradually being used in underwater acoustic communication.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL:</span>
FL come into fashion because it can decouple the data acquisition and compute at the central unit.
An analytical model is developed to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, to ensure the DL based communications can work at a new environment. Meta-learning, which can train the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates with a small number of labeled data to improve the transfer efficiency, has been used in wireless communications.
Therefore, many researchers pay attention to federated meta learning.
However, among many applications in federated learning based wireless network, deep learning (DL) based applications are actively and widely discussed on image classification task, such as MNIST, rather than DL based physical layer cases.
Recently, in the ocean of things, with the increasing computational capacity of device, such as buoys, unmanned ships and offshore platform, as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data. There is a precedent that the IoUT device can realize federated learning (FL) computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.3" class="ltx_p">For DL based applications, an important limitation of the approach is that training should be generally carried out from scratch for each new dataset. Aiming at improve the generalization of DL-receiver, we proposed FML based framework in random scheduling.
Squentially updating the network parameters from all edge nodes then do global aggregation which is very efficient than transimitted all data loacated on distributed node to the centre node. In many communication scenarios, the channel sources are precious. Hence, sheeduling police is used to allocate the limited channels to users. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the federated learning in wireless network with three scheduling policies have been studied and the convergences are analyzed.
However, existing federated learning focus on a sufficient dataset and is hard to adapt to new UWA environment when labeled data is rarely.
The issue of robust learning is highly concerned for machine learning for communications. Many approaches have been proposed, in particular the approach of coarse offline learning using data sets and fine learning in an online fashion have been proposed.
The goal of federated meta learning fits in well with this, which is to train models performing one or a few steps

Hence, we take DL-based communications system as an example.
In order to achieve the purpose of stable communication, each node selects chirp communications for UWA COMMs, because of its characteristic of anti-noise and robustness to Doppler.
The UWA stable communications adopt a pair of chirp signals in frequency band <math id="S4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[f_{1}-f_{2}]" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">[</mo><mrow id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml">f</mi><mn id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><msub id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">f</mi><mn id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">2</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">]</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2">delimited-[]</csymbol><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><minus id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.2">𝑓</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.2">𝑓</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1c">[f_{1}-f_{2}]</annotation></semantics></math> Hz to transmit information which can be expressed as</p>

<p id="S6.p1.8" class="ltx_p">In addition, massive data is critical for deep learning. In radio frequency (RF) communication system, the required data sets can be found online, such as DeepSig dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, RF channel dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. But open source underwater acoustic communication dataset for learning algorithm is still blank. What’s more, acoustic channel models and open-source software are foreseen as some of the key elements in the next generation of UWA COMMs research practices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
The approximate channel models can be implemented by the tapped delay line. We assume the signal is
bandlimited within bandwidth B which can be described by discrete samples. Hence, formula (<a href="#S4.E8" title="In IV UWA Chirp Communications Cases ‣ Federated Meta Learning Enhanced Acoustic Radio Cooperative Framework for Ocean of Things Underwater Acoustic Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) can be expressed as</p>

In addition, the CIRs measured under different environments are considered.
The raw CIRs were measured at Norway-Oslofjord (NOF), Norway-Continental Shelf (NCS)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and China-Wanlu Reservoir (CWR). It is worth noting that, in CWR, CIRs from different distances were collected. Both receiver and receiver terminals were located on two ships for long-distance communication test, with distances of 1100m, 2100m, and 6000m, respectively.
After this, we consider two specific condition as data augmentation.</p>

From the results, we can discover a distinct characteristic that the smaller sample factor we get, the lower bit error rate can be obtained.
This is due to the smaller sample factor means the more sample points which influence signal-to-noise ratio of the used signal in detection.
Besides, we can find that the C-DNN receiver can reach the almost ideal bit error rate performance.</p>

For deep learning based receiver, not only BER is the key characteristic to decipt communication system performance, but also needs the comparison of train loss and the valid loss to reflect the generalization capability of the receiver.
Fig.3 The DNN receiver BER performance can be
There is a fact that the receiver is easy to overfit as shown in Fig.4. When receiver is trained online, the loss of model on training set is better than that on validate set. Even so, when the receiver is deployed offline, the receiver performance can better than traditional minimum meansquare error algorithm based receiver . If the generalization ability of the model can be further improved, the receiver performance will be further improved. Deep learning based receiver has great potential.</p>

We use simulation data to train our C-DNN and test its performance under simulated and measured dataset. We test C-DNN under different scenarios, where NCS, NOF and CWR have diverse communication environments. It is worth mentioning that a variety of distance are employed in CWR. Hence, we can believe the C-DNN receiver can handle multiple scenarios with only a small loss of accuracy. That is to say, C-DNN is robust can deal with different channals. Moreover, we also test C-DNN performance under emergency conditions (EC) that the data augmentation cannot cover all Doppler shift and symbol timing offset cases. Unfortunately, under EC condition, the C-DNN encounter performance degradation because the DL-model meet something it had never seen before.</p>

But for test stage, test dataset considered, FL accuracy will decrease because the insufficient generalization of the model. FML utilize the then fine-tune the network with the labeled data in the target dataset. In genearl, if the source dataset and target dataset are highly related, a FL algorithm would perform well, without the need for fine-tuning the DL-receivers according to the target environment, which owes to generalization of it. However, most of the time, it’s hard to make source and target dataset equally distributed. Hence, FML has wider application scenarios.</p>

From the results, we can find that with the number of users increasing, the convergence of the whole system becomes faster.
It is easy to see that the larger data volume used for training, the better system performance can be got. But in a real system we can’t overdo the amount of local data, because of the distributed data storage, especially in the ocean.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning have great potential in underwater acoustic communication system but the disadvantage is sensitive to the distribution of training data. Therefore, considering the generalization of DL-based applications, we utilize the acoustic radio cooperation characteristic of OoT, we proposed
a federated Meta Learning Enhanced Acoustic Radio Cooperative Framework for Ocean of Things, which take advantage of the data distributed on surface nodes. Through this method, we can achieve transfer learning.
We take UWA chirp communications as an example, which can provide stable UWA COMMs for Ocean of Things.
In order to overcome UWA doppler shift and symbol time offset, we proposed C-DNN receiver based on data driven deep learning. Besides, to understand its performance, a comprehensive
convergence analysis framework for FML with random schedule in wireless is developed. This work represents the first
attempt to combine FML and DL in physical layer.
For future work, we will consider the framework of the
current work to sea trial. As another
interesting direction, the proposed design only for OoT device can be extended to the IoUT
scenario by using underwater unmanned submarine vehicle in an effort to utilizing the distributed data, further accelerating the learning process.
