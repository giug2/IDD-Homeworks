<p id="id5.7.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is typically considered a beneficial technology which allows multiple agents to collaborate with each other, improve the accuracy of their models, and solve problems which are otherwise too data-intensive / expensive to be solved individually. However, under the expectation other agents will share their data, rational agents may be tempted to engage in detrimental behavior such as <em id="id5.7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free-riding</em> where they contribute no data but still enjoy an improved model.
In this work, we propose a framework to analyze the behavior of such rational data generators. We first show how a naive scheme leads to catastrophic levels of free-riding where the benefits of data sharing are completely eroded. Then, using ideas from contract theory, we introduce <em id="id5.7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">accuracy shaping</em> based mechanisms to maximize the amount of data generated by each agent. These provably prevent free-riding without needing any payment mechanism.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data is a <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-rivalrous good</em>—once produced, it can be repeatedly used multiple times without exhaustion. Thus, multiple firms can simultaneously use the data produced by any individual firm, increasing societal utility/welfare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jones and Tonetti, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To promote such multiple usage, data portability requirements have been widely legislated, e.g., the GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mancini, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. As a consequence, services are required to enable a user to download any personal data collected and potentially re-upload it to a different service. These desiderata form a solid economic and legal basis for federated learning—a new paradigm in machine learning wherein multiple data-generating agents collaborate with each other to train a model on their <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">combined</em> data so that all the agents end up with a better model than they would have obtained on their own <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Such collaborative data sharing is already common in genomics research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Weinstein et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, internet advertisement targeting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Google, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, and is also gaining traction between networks of hospitals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(see, e.g., Sheller et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Wen et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Flores et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that once a certain amount of data has been produced, privacy issues aside, societal welfare is maximized by allowing free access to the data thereby making it a public good. However, under such an expectation, a rational agent may be tempted to <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free-ride</em>, i.e., consume the benefits of the data production by others without contributing any data themselves. This may lead to a collapse in the data generation with everyone wanting to free-ride. Such a problem inevitably arises with any public good <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Baumol, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>. Further, even if no agent actually free-rides and everyone intends to contribute data out of altruism, the mere perception that others may be free-riding reduces pro-social behavior and willingness to contribute <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Choi and Robertson, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Thus, the long-term success of federated learning in particular and data portability in general critically require overcoming free-riding.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The overall consequence of free-riding to the system is that a lesser amount of data may be generated. Thus, we can equivalently formulate the problem of preventing free-riding as that of maximizing the amount of data generated by the agents. This motivates our main question:</p>

</em></p>

However, providers may react to such a data-sharing regulation by reducing the amount of data they collect and instead free-riding, defeating the purpose of the legislation. <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">How should the government agency formulate its data-sharing legislation in order to maximize the total amount of data collected and shared?</em></p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Free-riding and fairness in federated learning.</h5>

<div id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent work has explored such free-riding behavior in federated learning schemes, with various incentive models proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sarikaya and Ercetin, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Fraboni et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Most of this work has, however, focused on a taxonomy of free-rider attacks or the detection of such attacks, instead of proposing mechanisms that incentivize maximal data contribution. In this work, we consider a mechanism for data sharing under the standard federated learning setting such that rational agents are incentivized to contribute their maximal amount of data.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Preventing free-riding behavior in federated learning is notoriously hard because the data collection and costs are private to the agents. This information asymmetry and the existence of a central server (a “principal”) suggests connections to contract theory, which studies the design of incentive mechanisms under a principal-agent model, where the agent possesses private information about their costs. Recently, there has been an emerging line of research exploring the application of contract theory for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kang et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">c</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>; Cong et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhan et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Lim et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Tian et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In particular, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed a contract-based aggregator under a multi-dimensional contract model over two possible types of agents and showed improved model generalization accuracy under that contract. However, their mechanism focused on eliciting the private type information instead of maximizing the data contribution. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to use contract theory for <span id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data maximization</span> in federated learning. Further, prior work has focused on how to design payments to agents, rather than the accuracy-shaping problem that we focus on here without any payment usage.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">More broadly, this work is related to an active line of research on mechanism design for collaborative machine learning, which involves multiple parties each with their own data, jointly training a model or making predictions in a common learning task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sim et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Xu et al., <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In collaborative machine learning, a major focus has been the design of model rewards (i.e., data valuation) in order to ensure certain fairness or accuracy objectives. Towards that goal, there has been model rewards proposed based on notions from the cooperative game theory literature such as the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jia et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.

We also assume each of them has access to the same data distribution and that we are in an i.i.d. setting. This holds true if the data is generated by manually labelling a subset of an already public unlabelled dataset, as is common in machine learning; e.g., Cifar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Krizhevsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> and ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Russakovsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.

For such a provider, improved accuracy in their models might directly imply better customer satisfaction and hence more sales. It might also imply lower downstream costs in term of law-suits, etc. However, a small number (say ten) data points are not in themselves of any value. This is because the true value needs to overcome additional fixed (non data-related) costs, as well as have sufficient accuracy to pass safety regulation. Thus, in practice, the real value of data is better captured by <math id="S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.5.5.m5.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="a(m)=\max(0,1-\nicefrac{{\beta}}{{m^{\alpha}}}-\tau)"

<p id="S3.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A mechanism which satisfies individual rationality guarantees that for any agent the accuracy of the model received (and hence their utility) will be no worse than if they trained on their own.
Since IR guarantees that all rational agents will participate in our mechanism, and participation is key to success of a federated learning platform, we will restrict our focus henceforth to mechanisms which satisfy IR. In the context of our running example of data-sharing legislation for autonomous driving, ensuring the mechanism satisfies IR means that the legislation is a win-win for all parties encouraging support and compliance—consumers get safer models and car companies get higher utilities.

This is sometimes justifiable—the cost of driving a vehicle to generate a data point by an autonomous-driving provider can be easily estimated by all parties, as can the cost of labelling a data point by a crowd-worker.

Then, we look at some implications of the proposed solution—how fairly it distributes the surplus and potential moral hazards it might induce.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.4" class="ltx_p">We have initiated the study of mechanism design for data sharing, where the goal is to maximize the amount of data collected and the accuracy of the final model trained. We showed that the standard scheme of sharing each agent’s data contribution with everyone else will inevitably lead to catastrophic free-riding where at most a single agent is contributing any data. In particular, this implies that when a learning problem is too difficult or expensive for a single agent to solve on their own, it will remain insurmountable under naive data sharing. Instead, more successful collaboration occurs if the data shared is tuned to the contributions of each of the agents. Our analysis suggests using a credible threat—agents receive the full benefit if they honestly submit data, but free-riding behavior is penalized by reducing the quality of the model returned. We presented examples of such schemes depending on whether the costs are verifiable or not.
Our framework and results can also be extended to compensate for additional fixed joining costs, to allow the accuracy functions <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{a_{i}(m)\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">{</mo><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.2.cmml">a</mi><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2b"><set id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1"><times id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1"></times><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.2">𝑎</ci><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.2c">\{a_{i}(m)\}</annotation></semantics></math> to be different across the agents, and to employ general increasing convex cost functions <math id="S5.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{c_{i}(m)\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml">{</mo><mrow id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.2.cmml">c</mi><mi id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">m</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.3" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2b"><set id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1"><apply id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1"><times id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1"></times><apply id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑚</ci></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.2c">\{c_{i}(m)\}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite such limitations, our proposed framework already yields rich insights on the design of data-sharing mechanisms, and we believe that it has even broader implications. The federated learning community has recently been grappling with questions such as how to compensate the participants for their contributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhan et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, incorporating incentives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhan et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, fairness constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shi et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and addressing privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. While numerous mechanisms with varying definitions for each of these goals have been proposed, a principled manner to compare them is absent. We believe that the data-maximization viewpoint may provide such a principled framework—the idea is to come up with a mechanism which in the long-term induces agent behavior that maximizes data (or, more generally, value) creation.</p>

<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The literature on mechanism design and federated learning is vast. We discussed the most closely related work in three verticals in the main text; we include a detailed review of the broader literature in this section.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past decade, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important paradigm in modern large-scale machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Konečnỳ et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016a</a>, Kim et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. Specifically, FL research has resulted in many applications to overcome practical challenges such as data silos and data sensitivity: on one side, since more training data often gives better model performance, data silos results in scarcity of labeled training data and puts limit on the industrial performance; on the other side, in high-stakes applications the data may contain private user information and thus the sharing of data is constrained by regulations and laws <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Voigt and Von dem Bussche, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Baik, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Cheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Mancini, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>. Given these challenges, FL provides a useful scheme for different agents / parties to train collaboratively and leverage the benefit from other agents’ data, while the training data remains distributed over the agents. Such a framework has been shown to be able to bring improved model performance to all the participants. Indeed, many prior works have been devoted to develop more scalable and communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Konečnỳ et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016b</a>, McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, one cannot ignore an important aspect in the standard FL scheme, which is the incentives aspect. The standard FL scheme may incentivize strategic agents to contribute less data in order to minimize their data collection cost and maximize the gain from participating in the federated learning mechanism. Although the participation and contribution of each agent is often legislated by certain protocols, such free-riding behavior has been notoriously hard to regulate and prevent in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Fraboni et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Huang et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. Recently, a few works have started to explore such free-riding behavior in FL, with various incentive models proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Richardson et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Sarikaya and Ercetin, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Fraboni et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>]</cite>. However, the majority this work has focused on a taxonomy of free-rider attacks or the detection of attacks under the existing FL scheme, instead of proposing mechanisms that incentivize maximal data contribution. In this work, we strive for a mechanism for information sharing under the standard federated learning setting such that rational agents are incentivized to contribute their maximal amount of data.</p>

<div id="A1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we focus on the free-riding behavior of FL agents in terms of data collection. In FL, the data collection happen on the agents’ side before they join the mechanism for training models. Therefore, the cost of collecting data is often <span id="A1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">private</span> information to each agent. Such an information asymmetry brings difficulty to prevent free-riding, because the agents might simply report fake costs. This brings the need to design <span id="A1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incentive</span> mechanisms for FL, under which the agents are incentivized to behave truthfully, which is also guaranteed to lead to the best utility.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Indeed, designing incentive mechanisms under private costs is not new, and has been a main focus of the contract theory literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Smith [<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>], Laffont and Martimort [<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>], Bolton and Dewatripont [<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the existence of a central server (a “principal”) in FL brings further convenience to apply a principle-agent model. An emerging line of recent works have been exploring the application of contract theory for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Kang et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">c</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>, Lim et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Tian et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Cong et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Zhan et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. In particular, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tian et al. [<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite> proposed a contract-based aggregator under a multi-dimensional contract model over two possible types of agents and showed improved model generalization accuracy under that contract. However, their mechanism focused on eliciting the private type information instead of maximizing the data contribution. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a first step to use contract theory for <span id="A1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data maximization</span> in federated learning. Further, prior work has focused on how to design payments to agents, rather than the accuracy-shaping problem that we focus on here.</p>

<div id="A1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This work is related to the active line of research on mechanism design for collaborative machine learning, which involves multiple parties each with their own data, jointly training a model or making predictions in a common learning task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sim et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Xu et al., <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>.
In collaborative machine learning, a major focus has been the design of model rewards (i.e., data valuation) in order to ensure certain fairness or accuracy objectives. Towards that goal, there has been model rewards proposed based on notions from the cooperative game theory literature such as the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Jia et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. However, the guarantees of these model rewards depend on the assumption that the agents are already willing to contribute the data they have. In this work, we study a different incentivization task for data maximization.</p>

<p id="A1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">More broadly, apart from data maximization, there are other objectives which are of interest in federated learning, such as fairness and welfare objectives, that have been under active study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Donahue and Kleinberg, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>, Mohri et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>.

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Until now, we assumed that the cost of all agents is known to everyone involved, or is atleast verifiable. In some settings where the costs are universal and outside the control of the agent, this assumption may be justified.
