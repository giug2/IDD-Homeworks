<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Today we live in a context in which devices are increasingly interconnected and sensorized and are almost ubiquitous. Deep learning has become in recent years a popular way to extract knowledge from the huge amount of data that these devices are able to collect. Nevertheless, centralized state-of-the-art learning methods have a number of drawbacks when facing real distributed problems, in which the available information is usually private, partial, biased and evolving over time. Federated learning is a popular framework that allows multiple distributed devices to train models remotely, collaboratively, and preserving data privacy. However, the current proposals in federated learning focus on deep architectures that in many cases are not feasible to implement in non-dedicated devices such as smartphones. Also, little research has been done regarding the scenario where data distribution changes over time in unforeseen ways, causing what is known as concept drift. Therefore, in this work we want to present Light Federated and Continual Consensus (LFedCon2), a new federated and continual architecture that uses light, traditional learners. Our method allows powerless devices (such as smartphones or robots) to learn in real time, locally, continuously, autonomously and from users, but also improving models globally, in the cloud, combining what is learned locally, in the devices. In order to test our proposal, we have applied it in a heterogeneous community of smartphone users to solve the problem of walking recognition. The results show the advantages that LFedCon2 provides with respect to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Smartphones, tablets, wearables, robots and “things” from the Internet of Things (IoT) are already counted in millions and allow a growing and sophisticated number of applications related to absolutely all human domains: education, health, leisure, travel, banking, sport, social interaction, etc. If we also take into account factors such as the progressive sensorization and the connection to the networks of these devices, we can talk about an authentic “society of devices” that is being formed around people.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The volume of data generated by these agents is growing rapidly. Having such an exponentially growing amount of data collected on real working conditions from distributed environments, together with a good intercommunication between devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, opens up a new world of opportunities. In particular, it will allow devices to incorporate models that evolve and adapt in order to perform better and better, thus benefiting the consumers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of distributed devices (smartphones, robots, etc.), applying traditional cloud-centric machine learning processes involves gathering data from all the devices in the cloud. This data, typically sensor measurements, photos, videos and location information, must be later uploaded and processed centrally in a cloud-based server or data center. Thereafter, the data is used to provide insights or produce effective inference models. With this approach, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">deep learning</em> techniques have proven to be very effective in terms of model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, in this kind of scenarios, cloud-centric learning is usually either ineffective or infeasible, since it involves facing the following challenges:</p>
</div>
<section id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Challenge 1: Scalability</h5>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are limitations both in storage and communication costs, as well as in computing speeds.
Central storage and the transfer of huge amounts of data over the network might take extremely much time and also require an unbearable financial cost. Note also that communication may be a continuous overhead, as data form real environments is continuously been updated. This can be especially challenging in tasks involving unstructured data, e.g., in video analytics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A cloud-centric approach can also imply long propagation delays and incur unacceptable latency for applications in which real-time decisions have to be made, e.g., in autonomous driving systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Similarly, central computing can take much more time than parallel processing of smaller parts of data.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Challenge 2: Data privacy and sensitivity</h5>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many popular applications deal with sensitive data, that is, any information about an user that circulates on the Internet and allows him/her to be identified. For example, the ID card, telephone number, or address, but also pictures, videos, browsing history, or geolocation. The central collection of such data is not desirable as it puts people’s privacy into risk. In recent years, governments have been implementing data privacy legislations in order to protect the consumer. Examples of this are the European Commission’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights in the US <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In particular, the consent (GDPR Art. 6) and data minimisation principles (GDPR Art. 5) limit data collection and storage only to what is consented by the consumer and absolutely necessary for processing. 
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These limitations have led in recent years to the emergence of new learning paradigms that bring processing and analysis capacity closer to the devices themselves, following the philosophy of edge or fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. A good example of this is the recent <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which allows the training of the model across multiple decentralized edge devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of room for improvement in this area. For example, most work on FL is based on deep neural network architectures, but deep learning usually requires huge amounts of data and high computational capabilities (not available on the edge devices). Also, there is a number of practical concerns that arise when running federated learning in production. In particular, the problem of nonstationarity and concept drift (i.e., when the underlying data distribution changes over time) is perhaps one of the most important ones, and has not yet been addressed in FL literature.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in the present work, we propose a new FL algorithm, <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Light Federated and Continual Consensus</em> (LFedCon2). Our method allows powerless devices (such as smartphones, wearables, or robots) to learn in real time, locally, continuously, autonomously and from users, but also improving models globally, in the cloud, combining what is learned locally, in the devices. Basically, it consists on the training of light, weak, local learners, on the devices themselves, which are later consensuated globally, in the cloud, using ensemble techniques. This global model is then returned to the devices so that they speed up the local learning and help to quickly improve device behaviour, at the same time that they are subdued to a new local adaptation process. Our algorithm is also able to deal with continuous single-task problems where the underlying distribution of data might be non-IID (independent and identically distributed) among the different client devices, but that also can change in unforeseen ways over time (concept drift).
As we will describe later, there are important benefits as a consequence of the explicit detection of concept drifts. In short, we can say that it helps us to answer two key questions: <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">what</em> needs to be learned and <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">when</em> it should be learned.
In this work, we will show the performance of our approach when it is used to solve the specific semi-supervised classification task of walking recognition in smartphones.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we have already mentioned in the previous section, applying cloud-centric learning in networks of smart and distributed agents, such as smartphones, robots or IoT devices, involves a number of issues. We are referring to the two challenges (scalability and data privacy) mentioned above. In this section, we are going to review some of the strategies that are being applied in this context of devices in order to address these challenges: cloud-centric variations, distributed learning, and federated learning.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Cloud-centric variations</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the last decade, there have emerged some cloud-centric variations that suggest that the learning process can take place in the cloud, but the learned model can be then transferred to the devices, which is where it is executed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Other proposals suggest that there may even be a final adjustment of the model at the local level. The latter would fall within the transfer learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. In this case, a global deep learning model obtained in the cloud would be a general solution that could be then adapted to each device locally.
Other hybrid solutions using local and cloud computing have also been explored. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the pre-training of a deep neural network (DNN) is carried out in the smartphone and the subsequent supervised training is performed in the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, any of these strategies will still involve moving a significant volume of potentially sensitive data. Therefore, a better option for learning in this kind of scenarios where data is naturally distributed seems to be a decentralized approach.</p>

Different from the cloud-centric approach, in this kind of algorithms the learning process can be carried out in a distributed and parallel manner along a network of interconnected devices, a.k.a. <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em> or <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">agents</em>. This client devices are able to collect, store, and process their own data locally. The learning process can be performed with or without explicit knowledge of the other agents. Once each device performs its local learning, a global integration stage is typically carried out in the cloud, so that a global model is agreed upon. Allocating the learning process among the network of devices is a natural way of scaling up learning algorithms in terms of storage, communication and computational cost.
Furthermore, it makes it easier to protect the privacy of the users, since sharing raw data with the cloud or with other participants can be avoided.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">These methods mainly focus on how to train a global model more efficiently, by managing large scale of devices simultaneously and making proper use of their hardware in a distributed and parallel way. For that purpose, there already exist many powerful optimization algorithms to solve the local sub-problems, which are developed from Gradient Descent (GD). The best known one is the ancient <em id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Stochastic Gradient Descent</em> (SGD), which greatly reduces the computation cost in each iteration compared with the normal gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
There are other proposals that rely on other optimization methods, such as those that use augmented Lagrangian methods, being <em id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</em> (ADMM) the most popular one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, a new learning framework called <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) has been boosted by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Its core idea is very similar to distributed learning, i.e., solving local problems on the devices and aggregate updates on a server without uploading the original user data. In fact, we could even contemplate state-of-the-art federated methods as distributed optimization algorithms (the first group of distributed methods mentioned above). However, FL has been considered in the literature as an independent paradigm as it has some key differences with more traditional distributed learning. Firstly, the main objective of federated learning is to ensure the privacy of the data and the users, so sharing sensitive information is not an option in FL. Besides, both approaches make different assumptions on the properties of the local datasets, as distributed learning mainly focus on parallelizing computing power, where federated learning, essentially designed to work on mobile device networks, aims at training on heterogeneous datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. A common underlying assumption in distributed learning is that the local datasets are identically distributed and roughly have the same size. None of these hypotheses are made for federated learning. Instead, the datasets are typically heterogeneous and their sizes may span several orders of magnitude.</p>

Nevertheless, there are still some constraints in the state-of-the-art methods that need to be addressed. In this work, we would like to highlight two of them: (1) the non-viability of deep architectures, and (2) the lack of methods to deal with nonstationarity of data. By following the list of challenges initiated in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we have:</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As far as we are aware, all the existing FL algorithms are based on deep neural network architectures. This is a significant constraint, since the type of learner to be used is often conditioned by the task to be solved, and deep neural networks are not always the best solution. In addition, the use of DNNs usually demands high amounts of data and high computing capabilities. To date, client devices, such as smartphones, do not have the appropriate hardware and software to carry out this computing. The most popular deep learning frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> or Pytorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, still do not have any available version for operating systems such as Android or iOS that allow the training of these models. In terms of hardware, although much progress has been made in recent decades, these kind of devices still cannot compete with dedicated computers capable of getting the most out of their GPUs. This is a major impediment to the introduction of FL-based solutions in the real world. Nevertheless, in many cases it could be solved using traditional learning methods, such as decision trees or support vector machines, that have lightweight implementations in multiple programming languages and for multiple operating systems.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most machine learning algorithms assume that data is stationary and IID, i.e., independent and identically distributed. However, it does not hold in many real world applications, where the underlying distribution of the data streams changes over time and between the different devices. Some authors have evaluated some FL algorithms on non-IID scenarios, analyzing the impact of non-identical client data partitions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, little research has been done studying the effect of non-stationary data streams along time. This phenomenon is known in the literature as <em id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">concept drift</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. If the concept drift occurs, the inducted pattern of past data may not be relevant to the new data, leading to poor predictions or decision outcomes. Yoon et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> propose a method for federated continual learning with Adaptive Parameter Communication, Fed-APC, which additively decomposes the network weights into global shared parameters and sparse task-specific parameters. They validate their approach on several settings, including multi-incremental-task continual scenarios.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other researchers working on federated learning who have addressed concept drift detection and adaptation in the underlying distribution of data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The new federated method we propose in this paper, LFedCon2, is intended to overcome these challenges. On the one hand, it is designed to work with weak traditional learners, e.g. decision trees, instead of DNNs. On the other hand, our algorithm is also able to deal with concept drift in continuous single-task problems. Moreover, the proposed architecture is asynchronous, and contemplates a semi-supervised learning, two additional aspects that make it more suitable to be deployed in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Iteratively, each of the devices creates and refines its own local model of the learning problem that is intended to be solved. For that, devices are continuously acquiring and storing new information through their sensors. This information is raw data, which must be locally preprocessed before being able to use it in a learning stage: noise detection, data transformation, feature extraction, data normalization, instance selection, etc. When local models are obtained, they are sent to the cloud where a new learning stage is performed to join the local knowledge, thus obtaining a global model. The global model is then shared with all the devices in the network. Each device can take advantage of that global model to improve the local one, thus starting a new cycle.
New data is continuously recorded in each device and will be also used to retrain better local models or refine existing ones. Of course, an improvement of the local models will result in an improvement at the global level too. Note that the information available at the local level will increase progressively. As it is unrealistic to assume that infinite storage is available, a compromise solution must be reached that retains previously learned knowledge that is still relevant at the same time as old information is replaced with new knowledge, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we have focused on semi-supervised scenarios, where the data in the local devices is partially labeled.
Nevertheless, the application of LFedCon2 to fully supervised problems is immediate.

<p id="S4.p2.2" class="ltx_p">In order to learn the local model, in this work we have opted for the use of ensemble methods. These methods have received much attention in stream data mining and large-scale learning. In particular, every device builds an ensemble of base classifiers.
Any algorithm that provides posterior probabilities for its predictions can be used as base classifier. In our case, in our experimental results (Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>), we tried different methods as base classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), C5.0 Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB).
In the same way, any state-of-the-art method could be used to combine the predictions of the base classifiers of the local ensemble. We opted for a simple but effective approach, employing decision rules, which effectively combine a posteriori class probabilities given by each classifier. Rule based ensemble have received very much attention because of their simplicity and because they do not require training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. When the base classifiers operate in the same measure space, as it is this case, averaging the different posterior estimates of each base classifier reduces the estimation noise, and therefore improves the decision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Thus, we should use a rule that averages the posterior estimates of the base classifiers. The sum rule could be used, but if any of the classifiers outputs an a posteriori probability for some class
which is an outlier, it will affect the average and this could lead to an incorrect decision. It is well known that a robust estimate of the mean is the median. Thus, we use the <em id="S4.p2.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">median rule</em>.

<p id="S4.p3.7" class="ltx_p">As we can see in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4 Local learning ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, our local device gathers data and, if there is a global model available, it uses it to annotate the unlabeled data (semi-supervised transduction). Otherwise, it keeps collecting data until it has enough examples to perform the training of the first local model.
A common question in machine learning is how much data is necessary to train a model. Unfortunately, the answer is not simple. In fact, it will depend on many factors, such as the complexity of the problem and the complexity of the learning algorithm.
Significant research efforts have been made to find the relationship between classification error, learning sample size, dimensionality and complexity of the classification algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Statistical heuristic methods have been frequently used to calculate a suitable sample size, typically based on the number of classes, the number of input features or the number of model parameters.
To ensure a minimally balanced training set with representation of all classes, in this work we establish a single heuristic rule that must be fulfilled in order to allow the training of a local model.

<p id="S4.p4.10" class="ltx_p">As we pointed out before, the local device collects data which is partially annotated. In fact, it will be common to have a much greater number of unlabeled than labeled examples. In order to deal with this, we perform what is called <em id="S4.p4.10.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">semi-supervised transduction</em>. To understand how it works we must remind that in LFedCon2 all devices receive the last global model achieved by consensus in the cloud (Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Light Federated and Continual Consensus: an overview ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
To take advantage of that knowledge globally agreed, our proposal uses the global model for labeling data that has no label. As soon as a new unlabeled instance is available, we use the latest global model, if any, to predict a possible label and, then, we filter the predictions based on their degree of confidence. We define the confidence of a prediction as the classifier conditional posterior probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>,

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, once the device has a global model and a local model, the remaining question is when this local model should be updated using the new data that is being collected. It makes no sense to update the local model if it is performing well. However, as we said before, data is usually non-stationary, i.e., its distribution evolves in time in an unpredictable way. This is what is usually called <span id="S4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">concept drift</span>. If a concept drift happens the model will lower its performance.

Therefore, there may occur concept drifts that affect all clients, some of them, or just a single one. Thus, we can generalize the problem in the following way: Given a time period <math id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[0,t]" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.2a"><mrow

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Drift detection refers to the techniques and mechanisms that characterize and quantify concept drift via identifying change points or change intervals in the underlying data distribution. In our proposal, if a concept drift is identified it means that the local model is no longer a good abstraction of the knowledge of the device, so it must be updated.
Drift detection algorithms are typically classified into three categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>: (1) error rate-based methods, (2) data distribution-based methods and (3) multiple hypothesis test methods. The first class of algorithms focuses on tracking changes in the online error rate of a reference classifier (in our case, it would be the latest local model). The second type uses a distance function or metric to quantify the dissimilarity between the distribution of historical data and the new data. The third group basically combines techniques from the two previous categories in different ways. Error rate-based methods operate only on true labeled data, because they need the labels to estimate the error rate of the classifier. Therefore, in order to take advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data, in this work we decided to use a data distribution-based algorithm, which do not present such a restriction. Thus, we have used an adapted version of the change detection technique (CDT) originally proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, which is a CUSUM-type CDT on <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">beta</span> distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once a drift is detected, the local classifier should be updated according to that drift. There exist three main groups of drift adaptation (or reaction) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>: (1) simple retraining, (2) ensemble retraining and (3) model adjusting. The first strategy is to simply retrain a new model combining in some way the latest data and the historical data to replace the obsolete model. The second one preserve old models in an ensemble and when a new one is trained, it is added to the ensemble, so that the local model itself is the ensemble. The third approach consist of developing a model that adaptatively learns from the changing data by partially updating itself. This last strategy is arguably the most efficient when drift only occurs in local regions. However, online model adjusting is not straightforward and it will depend on the specific learning algorithm being used. In fact, most of the methods from this category are based on decision trees because trees have the ability to examine and adapt to each sub-region separately.</p>

From now on, for simplicity, we will refer to this ensemble simply as the local model of the device.

<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Every time that a local device train or update its local model, the changes in that local model will be reported to the cloud. For the construction of the global model, we decided once again to use an ensemble, because of the good properties of these kind of methods that we already mention in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Local learning ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. As in the local level, any state-of-the-art ensemble technique could be used to combine the predictions of the local models.
Stacking, or stacked generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, is a technique for achieving the highest generalization accuracy that has probably been the most widely applied in distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Stacking tries to induce which base classifiers (in our case, local models) are reliable and which are not by training a meta-learner. This meta-learner is a higher-level model which is trained on a meta-dataset composed from the outputs of all base classifiers on a given training set.
However, it presents a great limitation, which is the need to have this meta-dataset available in advance. In the context of devices, this would involve gathering a certain amount of labeled data from all users in the cloud before being able to create a global model.
Therefore, a better solution is to use a simpler but equally effective rule-based ensemble, as we already do at the local level (Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Local learning ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). In this case, the optimal combining rule is the <em id="S5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">product rule</em>, because each local classifier operates in a different measure space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>: different environments, sensors, users, etc.

First, depending on the problem, there could be thousands or millions of connected devices, so using an ensemble of those dimensions could be computationally very expensive. As the global model is sent back to local devices, it would also have a negative impact on the bandwidth and computational requirements of the nodes. In addition, assuming that there is an optimal global abstraction of knowledge, not all the local models will reflect such knowledge in equal measure or bring the same wealth to the ensemble. On the contrary, there will be devices that, accidentally or intentionally, may be creating local models totally separated from reality, which should be detected in time so as not to participate in the ensemble.</p>

In particular, we are interested in checking to what extent the global models obtained from the consensus of the different local devices are capable of solving distributed and semi-supervised classification tasks. In addition, we also want to evaluate the evolution of these models over the time. In our experiments, we have used several base classifiers at the local level so as not to link the results and the architecture to any particular method (although, as we will see below, some of them are clearly suboptimal according to the strategy we propose).</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The task we have chosen to conduct our experiments is the detection of the walking activity on smartphones.
It is relatively easy to detect the walking activity and even count the steps when a person walks ideally with the mobile in the palm of his/her hand, facing upwards and without moving it too much. However, the situation gets much worse in real life, when the orientation of the mobile with respect to the body, as well as its location (hand, bag, pocket, ear, etc.), may change constantly as the person moves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the performance of our method and the evolution of the models over the time, we require an independent test set that is representative enough of the problem. Thus, we started by building a fully labeled test dataset, for which 77 different people participated. We asked the volunteers to perform different walking and non-walking activities in several conditions. Since manual data labeling would be very time-consuming, volunteers carried a set of sensorized devices in their legs (besides their own mobile) tied with sports armbands in order to automatically get a ground truth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Several features (21) from time and frequency domains were extracted from the 9-dimensional time series composed by the 3 axis of each of the 3 inertial sensors of the smartphone: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. This fully labeled dataset is composed of 7917 instances when dividing the data in time windows of 2.5 seconds. The ultimate goal of this set is to help us to evaluate the performance of the models we obtain applying LFedCon2. Nevertheless, we decided to apply the traditional learning approach first in order to have a baseline. Remember that in the context of distributed devices it is not always feasible to apply traditional methods. However, for this task it is, because we were able to obtain a sufficient amount of well-labeled data from a high number of users. This is one of the main reasons why we chose this problem to test our proposal. Thus, we applied some of the most popular and widely known supervised classification methods on this dataset:</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite the high performances shown in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we must admit that these numbers are unrealistic. Obtaining performances like those involves months of work, collecting and labeling data from different volunteers and re-tuning and re-obtaining increasingly robust models until significant improvements are no longer achieved. It is at that moment when the model is finally put into exploitation. In fact, we have tried all the models in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> on a smartphone and we have identified several situations, quite common in everyday life, where all of them fail, such as walking with the mobile in a back pocket of the pants, carrying the mobile in a backpack or shaking it slowly in the hand simulating the forces the device experience when the user is walking. No matter how complete we believe our dataset is, in many real problems there are going to be some situations that are poorly represented in the training data. The classical solution to this would be to collect new data of these situations where the model fails, try to obtain a better model robust to this situations and, once achieved, replace the old model with the new one.</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to build an appropriate training dataset to evaluate the federated, continual and semi-supervised learning possibilities of our proposal, we developed an Android application that samples and logs the inertial data on mobile phones continuously, after being processed. These data is all unlabeled. Nevertheless, the app allows the user to indicate whether he/she is walking or not through a switch button in the graphical interface, but this is optional, so depending on the user’s willingness to participate, there will be more or less labeled data. The app also labels autonomously some examples applying a series of heuristic rules when it comes to clearly identifiable positives or negatives (e.g., when the phone is at rest). With this app, we collected partially labeled data from 10 different people. Participants installed our application and recorded data continuously while they were performing their usual routine.

If we compare both tables, Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is clear that the latter results are substantially worse—approximately 10% worse in all the cases—. This is logical, since training now is carried out using a totally new dataset, obtained in a more realistic and unconstrained way, which contains biased and partially labeled data from a much smaller number of users.
Note that we have not obtained the new results using CNNs in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. This is because, for the experiments in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a dedicated mobile device was used, so recording raw data for training a CNN was not a problem. However, the new training set was obtained in a federated context using the participants’ own smartphones, so recording raw data was not an option.</p>

Furthermore, the use of RF or SGB as base classifiers does not seem to be the best option in the federated scenario, since these algorithms are already ensembles. For these cases there are probably much more efficient combination strategies that could be tested. For example, by creating an ensemble of Random Forests we are combining the final decisions of each of the forest, when it might be better to combine the decisions of all the trees of each forest, at a lower level. Proposals like this are out of the scope of this work, in which we have opted for a global learning method scalable to multiple settings.</p>

The fact that some suboptimal local models are being selected indicates that there are devices that value these models highly, which means that the selection criteria of the voters can be improved. Remember that LFedCon2 needs a mechanism for selecting local models to build the global one, but this could be other than DEV. However, designing a good selection method is not straightforward as some challenges must be addressed. Firstly, local models must be evaluated without centralized data being available anywhere and without even being able to retain all local data. In addition, a balance is required between precision in the selection and efficiency in the overall system. Improving the voting system may involve more communication between server and devices, which limits the scalability of the proposal. Nevertheless, in the results we have obtained we can notice how the global ensemble is able to provide good performance almost from the beginning. This leads us to think that perhaps it is not necessarily bad that some suboptimal classifiers are chosen and even that the diversity on the global ensemble is more important than the accuracy of each of its members.</p>

<p id="S6.p11.1" class="ltx_p">As we can see, LFedCon2 allows the society of devices to have a classifier from practically the beginning and to evolve it over time. In order to illustrate some other advantages of our approach, we have artificially modified the training dataset in different ways. Suppose now there are some users who are mislabeling the data, whether intentionally or not. To simulate this, we have inverted all the labels of four of the users. This is the maximum number of local datasets we can poison so that the system continues to properly choose the best participants for the global ensemble. In this example we have chosen three very active users (users 1, 2 and 9), and one more not very involved (user 9). The results using a single classifier trained on all the available data are those in Table <a href="#S6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The results using our method with different base classifiers are those shown in Table <a href="#S6.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. Figure <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 6 Experimental results ‣ Federated and continual learning for classification tasks in a society of devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> compares the ROC curves of the traditional models with the federated ones in this scenario. As can be appreciated, in this case LFedCon2 far outperforms the results provided by the classical approach. This is because the system is able to identify those noisy users and remove them from the global ensemble. In addition, the devices of those users will use the global model to label the unlabeled data correctly, thus overcoming the data that was manually mislabeled.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we have presented LFedCon2, a novel method for light, semi-supervised, asynchronous, federated, and continual classification. Our method allows to face real tasks where several distributed devices (smartphones, robots, etc.) continuously acquire biased and partially-labeled data, which evolves over time in unforeseen ways. It basically consists of training local models in each of the devices and then share those models with the cloud, where a global model is created. This global model is sent back to the devices and helps them to label unlabeled data to improve the performance of their local models. We have applied our proposal to a real classification task, walking recognition, and we have shown that our proposal obtains very high performances without the need of large amounts of labeled data collected at the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that we have opened a very promising line of research in the context of federated learning, and that there is still a lot of work to be done. In this work we have presented a new method with clearly separated components: local learning, semi-supervised labeling, local drift detection and adaptation, and selection of local candidates for the subsequent global consensus. However, we believe that all of these modules can be further improved. For example, we want to explore optimal ways to combine models locally and also in the cloud, study effective ways to perform distributed feature selection, analyze the use of the global model for instance selection in the local devices or the application of techniques such as amending <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, real world, physically distributed devices have an intrinsic data skewness property so, depending on the problem, instead of having a single global model, it could be more interesting to cluster users or devices that share similar properties and then obtain several global models, one for each group. Another promising approach could be to have some system of local adaptation of the global model, for example using transfer learning, so that it would be able to adjust to local particularities.</p>
