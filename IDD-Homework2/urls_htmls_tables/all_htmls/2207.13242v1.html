<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) task aims to answer questions that require additional external knowledge as well as an understanding of images and questions. Recent studies on KVQA inject an external knowledge in a multi-modal form, and as more knowledge is used, irrelevant information may be added and can confuse the question answering. In order to properly use the knowledge, this study proposes the following: 1) we introduce a novel semantic inconsistency measure computed from caption uncertainty and semantic similarity; 2) we suggest a new external knowledge assimilation method based on the semantic inconsistency measure and apply it to integrate explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge for KVQA; 3) the proposed method is evaluated with the OK-VQA dataset and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) task is to answer questions that require an understanding of images, questions, and additional external knowledge. The KVQA task is proposed with the aim of reaching human-level reasoning. Injecting huge knowledge related to the entities identified from images and questions in a multi-modal form is among the tasks being researched. However, as the knowledge base (KB) is often incomplete, when the context of the entities is not fully consistent with the KB, irrelevant information can be retrieved and confuse the question answering.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the example in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Uncertainty-based Visual Question Answering: Estimating Semantic Inconsistency between Image and Knowledge Base *This work was done when J. Chae was with Dongguk University." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the question can be answered with a full understanding of the image and question. However, the predicted answer can become yellow when we use related general knowledge, i.e., <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(banana, HasProperty, yellow)</span>. In this case, there is a conflict between the image and the knowledge base. We define semantic inconsistency as such conflicts between the image context and the knowledge extracted based on the object in the image or question keywords.
For KVQA, there have been a lot of approaches introduced to make use of external KB with the given image and the question. Recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> suggested a method of extracting external knowledge by using the object keywords of the image and the words in the question. However, as shown above, these approaches can suffer from semantic inconsistency when the context information of the VQA is not well used given the new information from the KB. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced graph-based approaches for the KVQA where the work focuses on how to extract the needed knowledge using graph algorithms. However, they lack considering how well the extracted knowledge match with the given image and the question, and the extracted knowledge can rather confuse the answer prediction. In such cases, we believe it is necessary to evaluate and adjust the amount of the external knowledge injected based on semantic inconsistency between the context of the image and the knowledge. In estimating semantic inconsistency, first we propose to make use of caption generation results which can indicate unusuality of the image. In addition, we develop a new uncertainty-based measure that uses knowledge context model pre-trained with commonsense knowledge. When generating the knowledge context for an image, the context that is inconsistent with the actual image context may incur uncertainty, and the semantic inconsistency can be estimated through an uncertainty measure. Furthermore, the inconsistency can be also estimated by the similarity between the generated knowledge context and the image context. This study combines these into a new approach for measuring such inconsistencies and introduces a new way of assimilating external knowledge.
This study is summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A lot of researches have studied image and text as a multi-modal form. By tokenizing the object in an image, an alignment between an object and text has been proposed to apply a self-attention model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> showed such models achieve better performance in various downstream tasks compared with other vision-language approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, this study experiments with the approach suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> for extracting the implicit knowledge. Multi-modal approaches using image features from Faster R-CNN or ResNet and question embedding of pre-trained models are also proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> generated joint representation through Bilinear Attention Map. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> extracted image-text joint representation by using image features and question embedding, and proposed a 3-way Tucker fusion method. In addition to using pre-trained models, there have also been studies trying to solve VQA tasks using additional external knowledge. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> proposed ArticleNet using Wikipedia search API related to keywords of an image and words of the question. A method for extracting an external knowledge related to the objects in an image was also introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> extracted the knowledge by using the object label output from the Faster R-CNN model. This study extracts more relevant knowledge by using not only image object keywords, but also words in the question.</p>

However, because the study focuses on the contents of the image, the method has a limitation in answering a question that requires additional knowledge. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> suggested graph-based VQA for capturing the interrelationship between objects and entities of external knowledge by combining concept graph and scene graph. However, the scene graph relation is limited because only locational information is considered, and in the OK-VQA dataset, the extraction method for location-based scene graphs does not show significant performance improvements.</p>

The latter is directly related to calculating hallucinated words that are irrelevant to the given context. We make use of the latter in measuring uncertainty in KVQA, as described below. The latter can be decomposed into two: aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For KVQA, this study proposes a semantic consistency model that relies on the uncertainty measures described above. The model relies on two types of knowledge sources inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>: 1) explicit knowledge and 2) implicit knowledge. The former is the knowledge extracted from RGCN that has the external KB as input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

Furthermore, the use of the explicit and implicit knowledge is adjusted based on the uncertainty estimation, as described in section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Semantic inconsistency between an image and an external KB ‣ III Approach ‣ Uncertainty-based Visual Question Answering: Estimating Semantic Inconsistency between Image and Knowledge Base *This work was done when J.

The correlation between aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty shows a positive correlation, with a value of 0.4518. The correlation analysis indicates that there are relations between caption similarity and uncertainty, as we expected.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a novel semantic inconsistency measure through uncertainty modeling and semantic similarity for KVQA that can make use of diverse KBs more effectively. As KBs are often incomplete or incompatible with the given problem, the use of knowledge should be moderated. With the proposed model, we achieve the state-of-the-art results on KVQA. As a future work, we plan to further explore diverse ways of using KBs based on the characteristics of the KB and the given problem.</p>
