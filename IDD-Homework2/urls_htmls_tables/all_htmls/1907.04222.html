<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">The quality inspection of solder balls by detecting and measuring the void is important to improve the
board yield issues in electronic circuits. In general, the inspection is carried out manually, based on
2D or 3D X-ray images. For high quality inspection, it is difficult to detect and measure voids accurately
with high repeatability through the manual inspection and the process is time consuming. In need of high quality
and fast inspection, various approaches were proposed, but, due to the various challenges like
vias, reflections from the plating or vias, inconsistent lighting, noise and void-like artifacts makes these
approaches difficult to work in all these challenging conditions. In recent times, deep learning approaches are
providing the outstanding accuracy in various computer vision tasks. Considering the need of high quality and
fast inspection, in this paper, we applied U-Net to segment the void regions in soldering balls.
As it is difficult to get the annotated dataset covering all the variations of void, we proposed an approach to
generated the synthetic dataset. The proposed approach is able to segment the voids and can be easily scaled to
various electronic products.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the electronic circuits manufacturing, a type of surface-mount named soldering ball grid array (BGA) is
being used widely. Due to various reasons the voids will appear in these soldering balls that will reduce
the life time of the device. Inspecting the quality of BGA to confirm the presence of voids is vital for quality
inspection and to reduce the cost of manufacturing  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hillman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. In general, 2D and 3D X-ray imaging is used and
voids are segmented based on the intensity differences within the BGA. Due to the low contrast between
the voids and the BGA,
it is difficult to accurately segment the void and an human expert is needed for the reliable inspection. The issue with
the human inspection is the low repeatability due to the perceptual differences. As the number of soldering balls in
BGA ranges from 10s to 100s,
each ball is to be inspected in serial fashion resulting in longer inspection time. Due to these challenges in manual
inspection, there is a need for low delay robust void detection approach that can be scaled to all 2D X-ray acquisition
device type, product type, layout of BGA and the void characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Image processing techniques are usually applied for void detection by segmenting each soldering ball and
segmenting the void regions within each soldering ball. The arrangement, size, intensity and number of soldering balls
will vary for different
devices. The challenging factors in void segmentation are relative intensity of voids, vias, plated-through holes,
reflections from the plating or vias, inconsistent lighting, background traces, noise, void-like artifacts, and
parallax effects. There is a need of robust techniques that are able to segment soldering balls and voids considering
all the mentioned factors.
Although many techniques are proposed since many years, but lacks in the robustness in dealing these various challenges.
The drawbacks of these approaches are scalability to new device types or different void
characteristics and the parameters has to be tuned manually for different device and material types.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Said et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is applied to detect edges, via extraction, filtering out false voids
and finally detect real voids. In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Peng and Nam (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, blob filters with various sizes are applied to segment the voids
of various sizes. In
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mouri et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, void detection is formulated as the matrix decomposition problem by assuming that void as sparse
component and non-negative matrix factorization approach is used to separate the void region from soldering ball.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The end to end void inspection process can be broadly split into two steps. In the first step, the soldering balls are
segmented from the input image and in the second step, the voids are to be segmented and analysed for each soldering
ball.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the first step, thresholding or background subtraction techniques are usually applied to remove the background,
that works well to separate out the soldering balls from background. Some of the soldering balls are
not detected due to shadowing of other components. In these cases, reference ball based matching technique is
applied in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Said et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Where, the reference template is used to match all the locations in the neighbourhood
of occluded soldering ball. The best matched location is considered as the location of occluded one. In general,
the pattern or arrangement of soldering balls will vary for each manufacturing device, prior information about the
soldering balls pattern can simplify the soldering ball segmentation. To solve the pattern issue various approaches
are proposed in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Said et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The challenging factors in void segmentation are relative intensity of voids, shape of void, vias, plated-through holes,
reflections from the plating or vias, inconsistent lighting, background traces, noise, void-like artifacts, and
parallax effects. The non-void soldering balls are of uniform intensity and voids are brighter with respect to
intensity of non-void
soldering ball. The shape of voids are assumed as circular in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Said et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> to simplify the detection.
But, in practical, the voids can be of regular and irregular shapes and the
overlapping of multiple regular voids will look as irregular void. The issue with the irregular shapes is
difficulty in distinguishing the irregular shape voids and overlapping voids. Normally, multiple voids will
appear. In some cases, the voids are partially or totally obscured by vias and the characteristics
of via reflections are similar to those of the actual voids. The challenges are the scalable robust void segmentation
irrespective of shape, number of voids, overlapping between multiple voids, and noises. In recent years, deep learning
techniques are
showing the
promising accuracy for various computer vision problems such as image classification, object detection and pixel level
segmentation. In this paper, we apply deep learning approach by formulating the void detecting problem as segmentation
problem. Some of the popular segmentation approaches are U-Net  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ronneberger et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, Mask R-CNN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>,

U-Net  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. U-net architecture consists of encoder and decoder network with skip connections and is widely
used in various segmentation problems. Deep learning approaches for void segmentation are not explored. In this paper,
we propose U-Net based approach for void regions segmentation. To detect the
soldering ball we followed the same approach used in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Said et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> with some modifications. For training the U-Net,
an large annotated dataset is needed resembling all the variations in voids. As it is difficult to get the void dataset
covering all the variations. Recently, synthetic dataset generation became the vital thing. In this paper, we proposed
the approach to generate the synthetic dataset to solve the data problem. According to our knowledge, this is the
first paper to propose the technique for generating the synthetic data for void detection. Initially we train the
2-class binary
image classification network (U-net encoder) to classify whether the image consists of void or not. U-net encoder
weights are initialized with this and end to end U-net (Encoder + Decoder) is trained for void segmentation.
The paper is organized as follow. The proposed approach is
described in section 2, experimental results are presented in section 3 and finally concluded in section 4.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed approach mainly consists of 3 stages as shown in the Fig.  <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Proposed Approach ‣ Void Region Segmentation in Ball Grid Array Using U-Net Approach and Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The first stage is the dataset creation. Given the input image,
soldering balls are to be segmented. For each soldering ball, the voids are to be
manually annotated aided by LoG, and classified into void or non-void types. Synthetic voids are augmented on the
non-void soldering balls to generate the dataset for training U-net. In the second stage, image classification
network (U-net encoder) is trained for void/non-void classification and end to end U-net (Encoder + Decoder) is
trained for void segmentation. Finally, testing is applied on the test dataset for evaluation including with post
processing step to remove the noises. The detailed description of these stages are
described next.</p>

balls. The template matching approach is used to segment the occluding balls. The reference soldering ball is used to
match all the locations in the occluded region. The location having the higher correlation is considered as the centre
of the occluded soldering ball. In this paper, we follow the similar steps with some modifications. The steps in our
proposed approach consists of slicing, otsu thresholding, circle fitting, filtering the false voids and interpolating
the occluded balls. In this paper, we proposed the location based filtering using the information of un-occluded
soldering balls. If the ball is missing in detection step then the distance between the neighbouring balls will be
more. We interpolate the location of occluded one based on the distances of neighbouring soldering balls.

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Given the images of soldering balls, the void contours are generated through manual annotation.
For this, LoG is applied at first to get the void contours. The LoG contours are
classified into two categories, opened and closed. For closed contours, The region inside the contour represents the
void and no manual labelling is required for these cases. Whereas, for opened contours, the contours are to be
closed by manually labelling the most probable pixels that forms the closed contour.
To do that, the input images, LoG contours are manually analysed by profiling the intensity values along horizontal
and vertical around the void using ImageJ to find the most probable pixels that forms the closed contour.
In case of overlapping contours, the contours are to be separated into individual ones.
The manual process required is to separate the individual contours in case of overlapping contours.
Given the input image and LoG mask, the overall manual process is to find the most probable pixels that can form the
closed contour in case of open contours and separate the individual contours in case of
overlapping contours. The voids with various strength usually appear in soldering balls, but the voids whose intensity
is more than certain threshold <math id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Thr_{min}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">T</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">h</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.2" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml">r</mi><mrow id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.2" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.2.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.3" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.3.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1a" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.4" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.4.cmml">n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑇</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">ℎ</ci><apply id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.2">𝑟</ci><apply id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3"><times id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.3">𝑖</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.4.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.3.4">𝑛</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">Thr_{min}</annotation></semantics></math> are considered as real voids.

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is widely known that, large dataset is the key to solve the problem using deep learning. Millions of images were
needed to solve the image classification problem and became the backbone network to solve the various vision
problems  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Training the network using less number of samples can results in over-fitting that
leads to poor accuracy. Recently, many novel approaches were proposed to solve the data and labelling problem
for various complex computer vision tasks. As the millions of labelled samples may not be available in most of
the cases, data augmentation, transfer learning  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, domain adaptation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hoffman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and synthetic
dataset creation became the vital approaches to improve the accuracy  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Perez and Wang (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. The simple photometric and
geometric transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, noise etc., were used for
data augmentation. Recently, GANs are more popular in generating synthetic samples that looks like real and are
widely used in data augmentation, creation of adversarial examples and image translation. Unsupervised learning
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Antoniou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> techniques are used for learning features, if the labelled data is not available.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As it is difficult to get the void samples
covering all the diversities (location, intensities and shape of voids, number of voids). Although data augmentation
techniques are usually applied, but it easily leads to over-fitting and doesn’t increase the sample diversity for void
segmentation.
As from the manual annotation it is observed that number of non-void samples
are more and the voids are of uniform intensity. There is a possibility to generate the synthetic voids with
various intensities, sizes, count, locations and augment them on the non-void soldering balls that looks like
real voids. This approach will create the more diverse samples and generalize the void detection that provides
the better accuracy in real test time. The real void samples characteristics has to be considered in generating
the synthetic voids so that the samples generated using synthetic domain should look as real. The characteristics
to be considered in creating the synthetic voids are mentioned below.</p>

shape of void, we assume that voids are circular. The factors considered here are void location (VL), void radius (VR),
void brightness (VB), amount of void blur (VBL),
void noise (VN) variance and number of voids or void count (VC).

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The architecture of U-net is based on encoder and decoder networks. The encoder takes the input image and extracts
the high level features. The decoder up-sample the extracted features to get the required output. There
are skip between the encoder and decoder that copies the feature map of encoder output in each layer to the
corresponding layer in decoder. At first, we construct the network for image classification to classify whether
the image consists of void or not. After that, we remove the fully connected layer and add the decoder network to
construct U-net. Weights for decoder are initialized randomly. The end to end U-net is trained for void segmentation.
The reason to train the encoder network separately is to have the better initial weights during the training of U-net.
The classification network and the corresponding network configuration is shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2.2.1 Training Image Classification Network (Encoder) ‣ 2.2 Training ‣ 2 Proposed Approach ‣ Void Region Segmentation in Ball Grid Array Using U-Net Approach and Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and

remained same. The reasonable F1 score can be obtained by using only proposed synthetic data compared to the one using
real data. The network weights trained on synthetic data can be used as initial weights for training on real data with
less number of real samples. With the help of synthetic data, less number of real samples are needed to get the better
F1 score.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The quality inspection of BGA by measuring the voids is vital for board yield issues. Various traditional approaches
were proposed for void segmentation but lacks in scalability and provides less accuracy. In this paper, we applied
U-net for void segmentation. In addition to that, we proposed an approach to generate the synthetic void dataset
by considering the variations in real voids. The synthetic data improved the accuracy compared to the ones which
is trained only using real data. The advantage of synthetic data is the data scalability and less number of real
void samples are needed. The proposed system is scalable to various device types or products. There is a scope for
further improvements in the future. In addition to the synthetic voids, synthetic soldering balls can be generated.
In this paper, we assumed the void shape as circular, but in real the voids can be of any shape. Irregular shape voids
can be generated and augmented for training. Improving the manual annotation can correctly evaluate the importance
of synthetic data.</p>
