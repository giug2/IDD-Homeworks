<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) emerges as a pioneering distributed machine learning paradigm for the 6G Hyper-Connectivity, harnessing data from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices while upholding data privacy. However, current FEEL algorithms struggle with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, leading to elevated communication costs and compromised model accuracy. To address these statistical imbalances within FEEL, we introduce a clustered data sharing framework, mitigating data heterogeneity by selectively sharing partial data from cluster heads to trusted associates through sidelink-aided multicasting. The collective communication pattern is integral to FEEL training, where both cluster formation and the efficiency of communication and computation impact training latency and accuracy simultaneously. To tackle the strictly coupled data sharing and resource optimization, we decompose the overall optimization problem into the clients clustering and effective data sharing subproblems. Specifically, a distribution-based adaptive clustering algorithm (DACA) is devised basing on three deductive cluster forming conditions, which ensures the maximum sharing yield. Meanwhile, we design a stochastic optimization based joint computed frequency and shared data volume optimization (JFVO) algorithm, determining the optimal resource allocation with an uncertain objective function. The experiments show that the proposed framework facilitates FEEL on non-IID datasets with faster convergence rate and higher model accuracy in a limited communication environment.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In modern wireless networks, the proliferation of advanced sensors has engendered a significant surge in data generation, spanning diverse modalities such as texts, images, videos, and audio streams <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This influx of big data is conventionally offloaded and stored on cloud platforms, often coupled with Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to facilitate a series of intelligent services. However, the privacy
leakage problem becomes critical when considering the exposure of sensitive raw data to potential attacks and cyber threats, especially after certain legislations on data privacy are introduced, e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This predicament causes data owners to become increasingly privacy-sensitive and hesitant to share their data. As a solution, a novel distributed learning paradigm, termed Federated Learning (FL), has been introduced to construct a high-quality model by leveraging locally-trained models instead of directly sharing raw local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL framework, a number of federated rounds are required between clients and servers to collaboratively achieve desired accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Given the nature of deep learning models containing millions of parameters, e.g., the Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-3.5 has 175 billion parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, transmitting such high-dimensional models results in a substantial communication costs.
By balancing communication and computation resources of edge devices, Federated Edge learning (FEEL) has been proposed to reduce latency and energy consumption in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Yet the training costs are still serious especially when training with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data across devices in FEEL.
In practice, due to the decentralized and geographically dispersed nature of edge devices, data within a federated learning environment displays significant variations and samples imbalance, i.e., statistical heterogeneity. Extensive research studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have shown that as the degree of heterogeneity increases, the convergence of the FEEL algorithm slows down, and more communication rounds are required for the desired accuracy. Therefore, the time consumption and weak accuracy caused by the non-IID data become the bottleneck of FEEL applied in real-world IoT applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There is plenty of research trying to solve the statistical heterogeneity problem, which can be categorized into two types: 1) model-driven and 2) data-driven <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
The <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model-driven</em> methods refer to designing the internal structure and parameters of the models to mitigate performance loss. Li <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> adds a proximal term to the local loss function to constrain the distance between the local model and the global model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> correct the update drift in local training and provide convergence guarantees for non-IID FL. Instead of training a single global model with well generalization, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> aim at grouping the client into clusters and training personalized models based on data distribution. These works assume that there is intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity in clients’ data distributions. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> provide the different model structures for heterogeneous clients by knowledge distillation techniques.
<em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Data-driven</em> approaches manipulate and augment the local data to make distribution more homogenous. Zhao <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, develop a method that shares a small subset of local data with all devices to improve model accuracy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose a hybrid learning mechanism wherein the server collaboratively trains the model with an approximately IID dataset uploaded from the clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> employs GAN technology to ensemble data information in a data-free manner, broadcasting the generator to all users and regulating local updates to mitigate bias.
Both approaches entail sacrificing additional communication or computational resources in order to achieve accuracy improvements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the communication cost, some other studies try to design resource-efficient FEEL system. These approaches aim to minimize FL loss while optimizing resource efficiency. Unfortunately, these two goals largely conflict with each other, as obtaining a higher-quality model often necessitates increased resource consumption, and vice versa.
Chen <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> introduce a joint learning and communication framework that derives a closed-form expression for convergence based on packet error rates, and formulates optimal strategies for user selection and resource allocation to minimize the FEEL loss function. Zhao <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> jointly minimizes the accuracy loss and the cost of data sharing to mitigate the impact of non-IID data, and proposes a computation-efficient algorithm to approach a stationary optimal solution. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposes a resource-efficient method for training a FL model with non-IID data, effectively minimizing cost through an auction approach and mitigating quality degradation through data sharing. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> analyzes the implicit connection between data distribution and trained models from empirical and mathematical perspectives, and proposes a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for selecting the optimal subset of devices. Therefore, it is a majority challenge for FEEL to accelerate training process in communication and computation meanwhile ensuring model performance with non-IID data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although these approaches have attempted to address the statistical heterogeneity issue at model-driven, data-driven, and system design levels, deploying non-IID FL in wireless communication systems still <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">faces challenges</span>. <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Firstly</em>, model-driven methods demand additional computing resources and show marginal improvements. The increased complexity of local training adds to the difficulty of applying FL in resource-constrained wireless networks. Much work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> demonstrate that data sharing is a straightforward and efficient method for directly mitigating model quality degradation. <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Secondly,</em> most data sharing methods work under the strongly assumption of a publicly available proxy data source on the server side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, building a pre-processed and labeled public dataset is a time-consuming and expensive task. Evaluating the quality of the shared dataset is also critical, since it directly ensures performance gains. <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Lastly</em>, the costs and privacy concerns of data sharing cannot be ignored. Exchanging data unavoidably raises information leakage, additional latency, and energy consumption. Specifically, when an excessive amount of data is transferred, the costs and privacy risks may outweigh the benefits of sharing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above analysis, this work proposes a data sharing framework that allows partial data exchanged among trusted user groups to reduce the degree of data heterogeneity. In the real-world scenario, there are certain devices with high-quality data that can accelerate FEEL training. By the aid of the high-bandwidth mmWave multicasting technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, these nodes can share the private data with trustable neighbors in close proximity communication (i.e., sidelink) directly without going through the base station (BS). These sidelink transmissions boost network ulity while saving spectrum resource since it enables the simultaneous delivery of content to multiple users through a single transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
By selectively exchanging data with trustworthy and dependable partners via sidelink-aided technology, communication overhead and privacy concerns can be effectively regulated. Moreover, the goals of this paper are not only to mitigate the statistical heterogeneity issue, but also to accelerate FEEL training by exploiting data and computility of edge network.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the divergence between the local and global distributions, one possible approach is to share data among the participating clients. Traditional data sharing schemes involve a centralized server sharing a portion of the global data, which is made available to all clients. However, this approach requires the creation of a publicly accessible proxy data source, which can be impractical or pose privacy concerns. Instead of centralized sharing, we randomly select clients to exchange local data within clusters. The preliminary experiments between this scheme and the standard FedAvg algorithm reveal that the convergence of the training process is impacted by three main factors.</p>

In brief, nodes with high data quality are preferred to be selected as cluster heads. While condition 2 guarantees optimal intra-cluster data sharing, the appropriate number of clusters and inter-cluster relationships are still undetermined.

<p id="S4.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed DACA offers several advantages over existing approaches. This algorithm addresses the complex clustering problem in a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. It does not rely on the clustering number as the priori parameter, making it adaptive to different constrained thresholds. Moreover, the proposed DACA achieves optimal cluster formation with low computational complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and show that it outperforms existing methods in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Experiment Results ‣ V Simulation and Experimental Results ‣ Faster Convergence on Heterogeneous Federated Edge Learning: An Adaptive Sidelink-Assisted Data Multicasting Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a>.

These improvements can be attributed to the fact that the proposed framework reduces the degree of non-IID data and adjusts the deviation of model update by local training. The train loss and test accuracy of DACA are close to central sharing under label distribution skew setting. However, as illustrated in Figs. <a href="#S5.F4.sf3" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Experimental Setup ‣ V Simulation and Experimental Results ‣ Faster Convergence on Heterogeneous Federated Edge Learning: An Adaptive Sidelink-Assisted Data Multicasting Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4c</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F4.sf6" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Experimental Setup ‣ V Simulation and Experimental Results ‣ Faster Convergence on Heterogeneous Federated Edge Learning: An Adaptive Sidelink-Assisted Data Multicasting Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4f</span></a>, the DACA shows favorable results even compared with central sharing method under feature distribution skew setting. This is because clustered data sharing has a larger sample variety than central sharing, where the former can serve as a better type of data augmentation on local dataset. This observation further demonstrates the superiority of DACA over clustered data sharing in terms of estimating statistical heterogeneity.</p>

SNR is an important parameter that affects the performance and quality of communication systems. We simulate various communication states by varying the SNR to 10dB, 15dB, and 20dB. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of JFVO algorithm in these varied communication states.

Traditional FL defines FL training delay as total delay, which includes model transmission and local processing. For FedAvg with central sharing, total delay includes data collection, sharing, and FL training. In contrast, clustered data sharing FEEL just considers training and sharing time. In Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Experiment Results ‣ V Simulation and Experimental Results ‣ Faster Convergence on Heterogeneous Federated Edge Learning: An Adaptive Sidelink-Assisted Data Multicasting Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the total delay of the conventional FedAvg algorithm increases as the number of users grows. This is due to the fact that limited communication resources lead to a reduction in transmission rates and an increase in FL training time. Compared with FedAvg, the total delay of clustered data sharing FEEL can be significantly reduced by employing the DACA and JFOV algorithms. This improvement can be attributed to the optimization of computational resources and a reduction in the number of convergence rounds. Notably, the sharing time gradually increases with the growing number of users. This is because of increased interference among cluster heads, which causes a decrease in the multicast rate of data sharing. Furthermore, the latency of clustered data sharing is slightly lower than that of central sharing, which involves extra delay for data uploading, referred to as <em id="S5.SS2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Collecting Time</em>.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigate and quantify the statistical heterogeneity which is identified as a primary impediment to the convergence of FL. Furthermore, we introduce a clustered data sharing framework to address the non-IID challenge in FEEL and formulate an optimization problem which is aimed at minimize the overall delay in transmission and computation. We decompose the original problem into two subproblem, each dedicated to identifying the optimal clustering strategy and efficient resource allocation. Three conditions are established to aid in clustering process, rooted in a privacy-preserving constrained graph. To enhance the efficacy of data sharing, a clustering algorithm is proposed for selecting cluster heads and credible associates based on the data distribution and the constraints. We derive a upper bound on FEEL convergence to fit the relationship between data distribution and the communication rounds. Then a stochastic optimization approach is employed to determine the optimal computed frequency and shared data volume. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is efficacious in mitigating the data heterogeneity within the system and expediting the FEEL training process. Moreover, our method exhibits well performance not only in resource-constrained environments but also in different non-IID cases.</p>

This phenomenon can be readily understood as increasing the local step size shifts the local models towards the local optimums.</p>
