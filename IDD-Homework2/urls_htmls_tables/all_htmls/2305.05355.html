<p id="id24.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, researchers have successfully employed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build enhanced recommender systems due to their capability to learn patterns from the interaction between involved entities.
In addition, previous studies have investigated federated learning as the main solution to enable a native privacy-preserving mechanism for the construction of global GNN models without collecting sensitive data into a single computation unit.
Still, privacy issues may arise as the analysis of local model updates produced by the federated clients can return information related to sensitive local data.
For this reason, experts proposed solutions that combine federated learning with Differential Privacy strategies and community-driven approaches, which involve combining data from neighbor clients to make the individual local updates less dependent on local sensitive data.</p>
<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we identify a crucial security flaw in such a configuration, and we design an attack capable of deceiving state-of-the-art defenses for federated learning.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the last few years, federated learning has gained growing attention from the research community thanks to its capability of supporting privacy-preserving approaches for the construction of machine learning and deep learning models.
Indeed, with the massive availability of data that characterizes the current information technology realm, complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions have been brought to life just by leveraging that data availability and the most recent technological advancements.
However, one of the baseline factors of the aforementioned data era is the diffused, user-level data production and collection.
On the one hand, this situation enables the design and realization of advanced AI products, but the user-level granularity of usable information has raised important privacy and security concerns on the other hand.
Moreover, in line with the technological advancements, the legal aspects and regulations have received increasing attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">voigt2017eu, </a>)</cite>, imposing, in some cases, even a firm limit to AI progress, driving researchers to work on solutions where privacy protection becomes the main constraint.
This is precisely one of the objectives of federated learning, whose design allows for the training of deep learning models avoiding the need to centralize the collection of possible sensitive data into a single computation unit.
Indeed, according to this learning paradigm, the computation is distributed, and each involved client is responsible for the independent training of a local model using a private, non-shareable set of data.
A super node, which acts as an aggregation server, coordinates the training task by collecting, at each training epoch, the updates of the local models from the clients and by applying a suitable aggregation strategy to build the final global model.
Previous studies have proven the successfulness of his technology, mainly in its horizontal variant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">yang2019federated, </a>)</cite>, applying it in many application contexts.
This is especially true in scenarios in which social collaboration among users can provide important contributions to obtain improved sophisticated AI solutions.
For instance, very recently, researchers have adopted deep learning approaches in the context of recommender systems to refine the recommendation strategy.
In this context, they demonstrated that graph neural networks (GNNs) are very promising due to their ability to learn patterns from the interactions between the modeled entities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">ying2018graph, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2022graph, </a>)</cite>.
However, an open issue concerning the use of GNNs refers to the so-called cold-start, for which freshly involved users do not have enough interaction history so that the model can learn adequate representations of their profiles.
To overcome this limitation, some recent studies have leveraged additional social information of involved users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">fan2019graph, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">mu2019graph, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2019neural, </a>)</cite>.
In this way, the representation of a user can also be learned by analyzing his/her social neighborhood.
According to this strategy, the underlying GNN of such a recommender system will model both the classical user-item interactions and the social user-user ones.
Of course, the introduction of additional sensitive data related to the social life of users has urged even more researchers to rapidly define and adopt privacy-preserving strategies, with federated learning being the most prominent choice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite its distributed design representing a native privacy solution, researchers have shown that federated learning is vulnerable to attacks.
Thus, an adversary could infer sensitive information related to the original private data of local clients based on the local model variations recorded during consecutive learning epochs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">lyu2020threats, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">chai2020secure, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>.
To address this vulnerability, several recent studies have combined federated learning with Differential Privacy techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcsherry2009differentially, </a>)</cite>.
This ensures that the rating assigned by users to items cannot be inferred by analyzing the local model updates of consecutive epochs.
However, as stated above, to face the cold-start issue, also social information can be included, thus adding a higher complexity level to the whole solution.
Leveraging this information, some authors have proposed to exploit the social nature of the underlying scenario to create an additional collaborative privacy-preserving mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2021fedgnn, </a>)</cite>.
In practice, the idea underlying these strategies is to augment the training of the local models with information derived from the surrounding social neighborhood so that the produced updates will not be dependent only on the local data.
Interestingly, as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>, such an augmentation mechanism not only addresses the privacy concerns discussed above but ultimately leads to the improved general performance of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The proposal described in this paper starts from these recent research efforts. Our intuition is that although the additional social collaborative solutions can help both in improving the performance of considered systems and in building strong privacy-preserving approaches, this paradigm can be maliciously exploited to craft very impactful cyber attacks.
In general, the decentralized nature of federated learning makes it a very interesting target environment for attackers. Indeed, each involved client, as well as the aggregating server, can become potential adversaries to the system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">fang2020local, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan2020backdoor, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">yang2023model, </a>)</cite>.
For this reason, the research community has developed several countermeasures and advanced protection solutions that can be successfully exploited to protect this complex environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">nguyen2023poisoning, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">fung2020limitations, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">blanchard2017machine, </a>)</cite>.
However, by analyzing the behavior of the most recent defenses, we can see that the main strategy adopted therein is basically to detect and isolate from the system any action that differs from the average behavior of the community composing the federated scenario.
By contrast, the collaborative strategy introduced by the novel privacy-preserving mechanisms tries to protect the local contributions of single clients.
To do so, these strategies suitably combine local updates with those of the surrounding community members.
From an attacker’s point of view, this configuration can become an opportunity to spread the attack to its neighbors.
Thus, obtaining a novel threat possibly capable of even deceiving the state-of-the-art protections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we leverage this intuition to design a novel AI-based attack strategy for a scenario characterized by a social recommender system equipped with the privacy protection measures introduced above.
Borrowing some ideas from the related literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">baruch2019little, </a>)</cite>, we include two modes for the attack in our design, namely: a convergence inhibition strategy (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Adversarial Mode</span>) and a deceptive rating injection solution (<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Backdoor Mode</span>).
More precisely, we implemented our proposal by focusing on the system described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>, in which a GNN model is trained with a federated learning approach to build a social recommender system.
To achieve a strong privacy protection level, the target system includes both a Local Differential Privacy module and a community-based mechanism, according to which pseudo-items derived from the community are included in the local model training.
We argue that, although the attack described in this paper is specifically tailored to the features of such a system, the underlying intuition and methodology can be generalized to other similar scenarios.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section is devoted to the description of background concepts for our study.
In particular, we begin by introducing existing federated learning solutions that focus on privacy-preserving applications, with particular emphasis on recommender systems based on Graph Neural Networks.
After that, we describe model poisoning attacks in this context and introduce the most popular and effective countermeasures.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning exploits decentralized parties, which own private sets of data to build global models through the suitable aggregation of learning information derived from the local training of individual models. This infrastructure ensures the construction of global models without sharing data between the involved parties. In any case, this scenario opens possible threats to the privacy of involved actors, including the possibility of inferring the private original data based on the model updates during the training phase or by observing the output produced subsequently.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, solutions like Local Differential Privacy (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">dwork2008differential, </a>)</cite> allow basic protection of the privacy of the federated learning clients by limiting the influence of the single datasets.
Generally speaking, Local Differential Privacy achieves privacy protection by norm clipping and adding noise to the updates of the local models from the clients. Some effective solutions apply Local Differential Privacy by adding Gaussian or Laplacian noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>:</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By introducing links between users, social recommender systems compensate for the data sparsity problem.
As typically done in Social Network Analysis, a very promising strategy in this setting is to model data through graphs, and then, ad-hoc Deep Learning algorithms, such as Graph Neural Networks, can be adapted to identify complex recommendation patterns.
Practically speaking, Graph Neural Networks are used to learn user and item embeddings from the graph to predict additional links between them.
Works like the one proposed by Fan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">fan2019graph, </a>)</cite> exploit Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Attention Networks, to learn the embeddings of users and items for recommendation purposes.
In particular, this paper showed how using a GNN as an underlying model for a recommender system can be effective and efficient. The advantage of such models is the ability to aggregate high-order structural information that is important for learning embeddings from users and items.
Of course, due to the sensitivity of involved training data, this type of solution could also be implemented through a federated learning approach, in which data concerning the links between users and items remain locally private.
For instance, Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2021fedgnn, </a>)</cite> proposed a federated learning approach to build a recommender system based on a GNN model collectively trained with highly decentralized user data.
This solution builds a robust model while preserving the privacy of the involved parties via Local Differential Privacy and user graph expansion, obtained by randomly sampling items from the neighbors.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to its decentralized nature, federated learning introduces important security issues in scenarios where the involved clients cannot be assumed to be honest. In such a case, local model updates can be orchestrated by attackers to cause a detriment in the global model performance or, even worse, to drive the model behavior maliciously.
As described in Section <a href="#S2.SS4" title="2.4. Defenses against Model Poisoning ‣ 2. Background ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4</span></a>, to overcome these flaws, the aggregator entity of the federated learning solution can apply different robust aggregation strategies to limit the impact of such attacks.
These defense methods are, typically, Byzantine-robust algorithms that filter possibly malicious updates returned by the clients using statistical approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, a baseline strategy could be to exclude gradient updates too distant from the mean (outside the interval confidence) of the distribution of the updates of all the clients.
However, the recent scientific literature has demonstrated that these methods are still vulnerable to model poisoning attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting, Baruch et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">baruch2019little, </a>)</cite> proposed one of the most well-known attacks trying to circumvent these defense strategies.
There, the authors defined two attack variations, namely <span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Convergence Prevention</span> and <span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Backdooring</span>.
In the first version of the attack, the attacker controls a small set of clients and tries to perturb their updates, within a statistically admissible range, with the objective of preventing the convergence of the model.
Gradients are perturbed by finding a deviation range from the mean that cannot be detected by defense methods based on statistical heuristics.
Specifically, the attack identifies the updates from local models with the maximum distance from the mean of the update distribution. Then it boosts this edge signal by replicating it in all the updates sent by the attacked clients.
Instead, the second attack they proposed is a <span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backdoor</span> attack in which the attacker poisons the model during the training phase to force the prediction of a specific target class against a controlled input pattern.
In practice, the attacker seeks a range of parameters that, if attacked, force the model to produce the desired label. A successful configuration must not affect the model’s performance on benign inputs.
In our paper, we follow a similar strategy and design two different variants of our attack.
In particular, our attack leverages the vulnerabilities introduced by the recent privacy-preserving techniques for GNN-based recommender systems trained through federated learning. As we show in our experiments, our attack proved to be more effective than the one presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">baruch2019little, </a>)</cite> also against the defense mechanisms described in the next section.</p>

In this case, the authors have defined two versions of the attack, the former referring to a situation in which the attacker has partial knowledge of the clients (i.e., the attacker knows only the controlled clients), and the latter, instead focusing on a condition in which the attacker has full knowledge of the federated learning scenario.
In both cases, the attacker crafts compromised local updates by maximizing or minimizing the parameters in such a way as to skew the global model in the reverse of the expected gradient direction; that is, the direction along which the global model would converge in a favorable situation.</p>

However, as explained above, this strategy introduces many security issues in general scenarios where the clients cannot be assumed fully secure.
Among the other security threats, model poisoning, either in the form of convergence prevention or backdooring, is, for sure, one of the most critical. Over the years, researchers have proposed several countermeasures for this reason.

<p id="S2.SS4.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Recently, Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">nguyen2022flame, </a>)</cite> proposed an advanced defense mechanism for <span id="S2.SS4.p3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backdoor</span> attacks, named <span id="S2.SS4.p3.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLAME</span>, which combines a clustering algorithm with an adaptive differential privacy strategy.
The workflow of <span id="S2.SS4.p3.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLAME</span> consists of three main steps, namely: filtering, clipping, and noising.
The objective of the first step is to filter malicious clients and select only those with the highest probability of being honest.
To do so, the authors perform a clustering over the pairwise cosine similarity distances among the updates received from the clients using HDBSCAN.
Specifically, they configured it to return a cluster that includes at least 50% of the batch of clients. With this setting, the candidate cluster will contain the majority of clients, and all the remaining updates, possibly poisoned, are marked as outliers.
The second and third steps are dedicated to an adaptive differential privacy approach that estimates an effective clipping bound and a sufficient level of noise, such that the effect of the backdoor attack is removed while preserving the original performance of the model.
The clipping bound should be dynamically adapted to the decreasing trend of the gradients’ <math id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{2}-norm" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">L</mi><mn id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mrow id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">r</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1b" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.5" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.5.cmml">m</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1"><minus id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝐿</ci><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3">2</cn></apply><apply id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑜</ci><ci id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.4">𝑟</ci><ci id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.5.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.5">𝑚</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS4.p3.1.m1.1c">L_{2}-norm</annotation></semantics></math>.

The clipped updates are then aggregated to obtain the new global model.
The third step adds a certain amount of noise to the aggregated updates. This amount is determined by estimating a sensitivity value based on the distance between the clients’ updates. In this way, the proposed strategy can override the contribution of the attack on the global model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Fung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">fung2020limitations, </a>)</cite> proposed another defense solution with the name of <span id="S2.SS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FoolsGold</span>.
In any iteration, <span id="S2.SS4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FoolsGold</span> adapts the learning rate of each client based on the similarity distance of the updates, also considering information derived from past iterations.
To measure the distance between the updates, as done by <span id="S2.SS4.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLAME</span>, the cosine similarity is used.
Poisoning attacks usually affect specific features of the model, which can be identified by measuring the magnitude of model parameters in the output layer of the global model. Hence, the malicious updates can be removed or re-weighted.
Another key point of <span id="S2.SS4.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FoolsGold</span> is the exploitation of the history of the previous updates.
Indeed, as stated above, the similarity distance among the updates is computed by considering the current values returned by the clients and the values of the historical updates produced in the previous iterations.
This additional feature allows more accurate identification of malicious attempts to corrupt the federated learning task.</p>

To make our strategy concrete, we focus on a recent solution in this setting proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>.
It is worth observing that, although, in our approach, we make explicit reference to such a scenario, the main feature we are focusing on is a common strategy of social systems. Indeed, in such contexts, collaboration is generally leveraged to obtain joint advantages among peers.
Our strategy relies just on the fact that, if the common objective of the social system is to achieve privacy protection, such collaboration is typically “blind”, and, even better, includes a Local Differential Privacy strategy, in such a way as to ensure non-disclosure of sensitive information.
We argue that, if properly handled, this condition can be exploitable to craft critical security menaces for social scenarios.</p>

Of course, for these additional pseudo-items only the corresponding embeddings are available to the client (through the embedding table available from the server). As for the corresponding ratings, a semi-supervised strategy is adopted, according to which the client uses its current local model to predict them for each pseudo-items.
At this point, such pseudo-items are included in the local loss computation as follows:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By design, the referring scenario introduces two main techniques that aim to improve the privacy protection of clients’ data, while ensuring greater robustness of the global model built through federated learning.
Among them, the design choice of including pseudo-items in the local embeddings of clients plays a crucial role.
Indeed, as stated in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1. The System Model ‣ 3. System Model and Attack Intuition ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, because the adopted pseudo-items are generated from real-data embeddings gathered from other clients, the introduced noise is informative and resembles a data augmentation solution.
On the other hand, in the case in which the assumption of the trustworthiness of clients does not hold, such an approach could lead to exploit opportunities for attackers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that by leveraging this privacy-preserving social collaboration mechanism, it is possible to design a very powerful poisoning attack.
As will be shown in the experiments described in this paper, the social nature of such an attack allows the achievement of considerable performance also in the presence of cutting-edge defense solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">More in detail, the social mechanism of sampling pseudo-elements of peer clients to improve privacy protection, allows the possibility of involving such peers in prearranged attacks and, therefore, forcing them to include poisoned elements in their local training process, unknowingly.
Our attack aims, therefore, at performing a model poisoning by forging a malicious set of item embeddings. Our objective is to deceive the target recommender system and make it act as intended by the attacker, either by inhibiting convergence of the underlying GNN model or by performing a <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backdoor</span> attack to force the system to predict specific ratings for items in relation to a target user.
In such a context, not only pseudo-items could be exploited, but also the Local Differential Privacy strategy could play a key role in the attack process.
As a matter of fact, many countermeasures, like for example the one proposed by Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">nguyen2022flame, </a>)</cite>, make use of Differential Privacy to override or erase the contribution of an attack, thus filtering malicious gradients updates in a federated learning solution.
In our case, the Local Differential Privacy module, which is included in the privacy-aware social recommender system, acts as a regulator of the attack so that the poisoned changes to updates are the most similar to benign ones, while still guaranteeing the effectiveness of the attack.</p>

In practice, it aims at forcing the model to predict specific ratings for items in relation to a target user.

It is worth observing that a domino effect is triggered by this strategy. Indeed, in doing so, the attacker poisons not only the updates of the local model but also the embeddings of the corresponding user, its neighbors, and the associated items.

As visible in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ Evaluation Metrics. ‣ 5.1. The Considered Testbeds ‣ 5. Attack Evaluation ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, this metric returns the percentage of target items whose residuals are lower than the Standard Error of the estimate function for good items. The objective of this metric is to assess whether the error produced by the model on the target items, with respect to the rating value aimed by the attacker, is comparable to the average baseline error rate obtained for good items (we require that this error is even lower than the average to declare an attack success). Indeed, such a condition would imply that the built backdoor successfully changes the behavior of the attacked model, forcing it to predict, for the target items, the ratings imposed by the attacker.</p>

Moreover, as commonly done in this context, we also consider different protection configurations based on the most common and effective Federated Learning defenses, namely: <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>, <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">TrimmedMean</span>, <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FoolsGold</span>, and <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Flame</span> (see Section <a href="#S2.SS4" title="2.4.

Moreover, to provide a comparison baseline for the assessment of the effectiveness of our solution, we report: <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(i)</span> the basic performance of the considered GNN model without the additional privacy-aware social mechanism proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite> based on pseudo-items (<span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Baseline Scenario</span>), <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(ii)</span> the performance obtained in the same configuration when the system is attacked by a reference state-of-the-art attack, i.e., the Little Is Enough attack (LIE) (Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3.

The obtained result also confirms that the use of community-derived pseudo-items and, in general, collaborative strategies to achieve privacy protection improves the robustness of the federated learning model (as originally shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite>) but, at the same time, provides an adversary with the means to perform possibly stronger attack. As presented in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1. Adversarial Mode - Convergence Inhibition ‣ 4. Attack Description ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, our attack crafts the embeddings of the pseudo-item by maximizing the loss of the model at each epoch. To assess the reasoning behind our strategy, in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2. Results: Adversarial Mode ‣ 5. Attack Evaluation ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we report the results obtained by a basic attack in which, instead of learning optimal embeddings at each iteration, they are initialized with Gaussian noise. As we can clearly see from this table, the attack on pseudo-items using Gaussian noise does not affect the performance of the model, thus confirming that only an AI-driven attack can suitably exploit this scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a final remark on these first results, we observe that our attack proved to be resistant to all the different countermeasures we considered.
In fact, as expected, the use of Local Differential Privacy gives boundaries to the adversary, allowing for a controlled impact of the attack on gradients, thus keeping them quite similar to benign ones and, therefore, very complex to detect.
The underlying assumption of the aforementioned defenses is that such a limited impact on the gradients, in principle, would completely prevent the effectiveness of the attack. However, the additional community-based privacy solution of the attacked scenario provides an opportunity to boost this malicious signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To have a confirmation of our intuition, in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2. Results: Adversarial Mode ‣ 5. Attack Evaluation ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we show the variation of the performance metrics of the GNN model during the training phase.
We can see at the very beginning of the training phase, the performances of the federated model on the validation set, with and without attacks, are almost identical. As the training continues, the difference between the normal and the attacked model increases, reaching high values by the end of it.
Indeed, after the first epoch, the clients surrounding the nodes controlled by the attacker begin to sample the malicious pseudo-items forged by them, thus permanently poisoning their local models. Such a mechanism continues, epoch by epoch, expanding the malicious signal to a growing neighborhood. In the end, all the poisoned clients will contribute to the attack boosting the negligible original signal produced by the attacker.</p>

Here, we can see how changing the number of sampled items does not significantly affect the performance of the attack.
This indicates that, at least for the considered datasets, a small number of pseudo-items is enough to spread the malicious payload to a sufficiently large set of clients, which, then, will unknowingly act as additional collaborators of the attacker.</p>

This metric estimates how close the ratings of the selected items predicted for the target user are with respect to the values proposed by the attacker.
To return a reliable estimation, it also considers the general error of the regressor (standard error of estimate) to purge the evaluation from possibly wrong predictions related to the accuracy of the model.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.6" class="ltx_p">As a final experiment, we proceed by testing our Backdoor Mode attack against a real-life recommendation system.
To do so, first of all, we designed a recommender system on top of the GNN-based model described in the previous sections. Such a model includes the embedding of users and items according to their interactions, which are described in the datasets of reference in this paper (see Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1. The Considered Testbeds ‣ 5. Attack Evaluation ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>). Moreover, as stated in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1. The System Model ‣ 3. System Model and Attack Intuition ‣ Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, given the embeddings of a user and an item, an estimate of the rating that the given user would assign to the target item can be obtained through the dot-product between their embeddings.
With this information, it is possible to build a recommender system capable of suggesting an item to a user if the estimated rating, according to the strategy above, is higher than a recommendation threshold <math id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝛿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">\delta</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate that our backdoor attack can force a recommender system to suggest to a target user any item (also those that would normally receive a minimum rating score).
Of course, it can even be used in the opposite direction, that is, to force the removal of a good item from the set of recommendable ones for a target user.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.10" class="ltx_p">To properly configure our test, we started by selecting a target user and training the model in a safe configuration without attacks. Then, using the trained model, we estimated the rating of all the items available in relation to the target user.
After this, we sorted them and created a ranking of items for the target user.
As stated above, the goal of the attacker can be either to force the recommendation of a specific item to a target user or to remove a good item from the user recommendation list.
In both cases, we considered the worst-case situation, in which the specific item has originally an extremely low rating for the former objective, or an extremely high one, for the latter.
To obtain this configuration, as for the former objective, we selected the bottom <math id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> items of the ranking above, and for the latter attack objective, we selected the top <math id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p3.2.m2.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> items as targets.

This behavior could be because this dataset has a fewer number of items concerning the others, thus increasing the probability for a single item to be sampled by multiple clients.
In this way, the contribution of the attack could be partially overwritten by the benign clients’ updates, which implies a slight reduction of the attack performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated recommender systems are becoming popular due to regulation on data and privacy of the users, like GDPR in the European Union <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2021fedgnn, </a>)</cite>.
This solution allows social media platforms to build effective recommender systems useful to produce high-quality suggestions while preserving the privacy of the final user.
However, this kind of collaborative strategy might be affected by malicious users that take part in the training of the federated recommender system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">hitaj2017deep, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2022pipattack, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">christakopoulou2019adversarial, </a>)</cite>.</p>

The proposed solution is designed to preserve the main characteristics of the data, thus ensuring unnoticeable changes.
Generative Adversarial Networks not only can be used to attack the systems in an adversarial way, but they are also effective in stealing private information from other users.
An example of that has been proposed by Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">hitaj2017deep, </a>)</cite> in which the attacker runs the collaborative learning algorithm and reconstructs sensitive information stored on the victim’s device.
The attacker also influences the training process inducing the victim to disclose more detailed information.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional poisoning attacks on recommender systems, known as shilling attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">lam2004shilling, </a>)</cite>, are not targeted to a specific type of recommender system. Therefore, the performance that they can achieve is sub-optimal to an attack targeted at a specific recommender system. Fang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">fang2020influence, </a>)</cite> proposed a series of techniques that optimize the attack to be more effective and achieve better performances compared to general shilling attacks.
Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2022fedattack, </a>)</cite> proposed another optimized attack on recommender systems. In this paper, the authors proposed to use globally hardest sampling as a poisoning technique.
In particular, they retrieve pseudo “hardest positive samples” that are farthest from user embeddings to replace the original positive samples. The obtained gradients significantly impact the model convergence while being difficult to be perceived as malicious updates from the server.
Fang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">fang2018poisoning, </a>)</cite> presented a poisoning attack optimized for graph-based recommender systems, like the attack we are proposing.
More in detail, in this poisoning attack, the authors’ goal is to deceive the graph-based recommender system making it promote a target item to as many users as possible injecting fake users that give fake ratings to a subset of the items.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The superior ability of graph neural networks to learn graph-structured data makes them ideal for recommender systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">qiu2020exploiting, </a>)</cite>.
Considering this, Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">nguyen2023poisoning, </a>)</cite> proposed an attack that leverages both the representations of items and users to learn an optimal attack on a surrogate model. The proposed framework, similar to the one described above, synthesizes new users and associated edges to be added into a heterogeneous graph between real users and items before feeding the poisoned graph as input for optimization.
Graph-based recommender systems are also vulnerable to optimized backdoor attacks such as the one proposed by Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">zheng2023link, </a>)</cite>.
In particular, the authors designed a backdoor attack against link prediction that injects nodes and uses gradient information to generate optimized triggers building a relationship between any two nodes in the graph to construct a general attack.</p>

<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The GNN models are also prone to attacks that aim at the privacy of the model and the data.

In particular, the authors designed six different attacks considering a comprehensive taxonomy of the threat model with various types of adversary knowledge.
They analyzed the main factors that contribute to group property inference attacks’ success and they found that it is possible to infer the existence of a target property by using the correlation between the property feature and a label in the target model.
Duddu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">duddu2020quantifying, </a>)</cite> designed three different attacks: the first infers if a node was included in the training graph, the second recreates the target graph, and the third infers sensitive attributes of the graph.
Considering attacks against the model instead, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2022inference, </a>)</cite> proposed a property inference attack that aims to infer the basic properties of the graph given the graph embeddings.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we described an AI-based attack against a scenario composed of a privacy-preserving social recommender system leveraging Graph Neural Networks and federated learning to produce item recommendations.
Our attack design starts by analyzing the security of recent approaches aiming at building such recommender systems, including Differential Privacy and community-based strategies to improve sensitive data protection in federated learning contexts.
As a matter of fact, although, by design, one of the main features of federated learning is privacy protection, researchers have shown that, by analyzing local model updates produced by federated clients, it is possible to infer sensitive information concerning the local datasets.
For this reason, recent studies have included additional privacy protection strategies to face the above-mentioned issue.
This is the case of recent investigations in the context of social recommender systems, in which federated learning and Graph Neural Networks are adopted to build a predictive model to estimate item ratings to be fed to an underlying recommendation engine.
In such a scenario, some authors have proposed combining Differential Privacy modules with novel privacy-preserving strategies based on the main characteristics of the underlying scenario.
Indeed, in the context of social recommender systems, user interactions play a crucial role; this additional information allows the identification of communities of users related to each other.
Leveraging these communities for each client, it is possible to augment the training of their local model with knowledge derived from the other community members, thus creating an additional separation between the local updates and the training-sensitive data.
However, our intuition is that, if properly exploited, these additional privacy-preserving mechanisms can be used to produce a very impacting model poisoning attack against federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we demonstrated this concept by designing a novel AI-based model poisoning attack with two operating modes, namely: <span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Adversarial Mode</span> producing a convergence inhibition effect and <span id="S7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Backdoor Mode</span> creating a deceptive rating injection attack on the federated model.
We tested our solution against a target social recommender system proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022federated, </a>)</cite> in a federated learning scenario equipped with the most effective state-of-the-art defenses.
The experimental results have shown how our attack is effective in all the considered cases. Moreover, to further show the significance of our achievements, we built a real-life recommender system to demonstrate that, with our attack operating in Backdoor Mode, an adversary can fully control the recommendations produced for specific target users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The proposal described in this paper must not be intended as conclusive. Indeed, to demonstrate the general validity of our method, we are planning to extend our investigation by adapting the proposed attack strategy to other possible scenarios.
Moreover, the vulnerability we discovered is based on the collaborative nature of some privacy-preserving approaches for federated learning. For this reason, we intend to work on designing possible extensions of existing defenses to cope with the identified flaw.
Finally, we made explicit reference to a horizontal federated learning scenario. In the future, we plan to extend our research to vertical federated learning. Of course, due to the specificities of this variant, a thorough investigation must be carried out to understand how our attack methodology can be adapted to it.</p>
