<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Current federated learning algorithms take tens of communication rounds transmitting unwieldy model weights under ideal circumstances and hundreds when data is poorly distributed.
Inspired by recent work on dataset distillation and distributed one-shot learning, we propose Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning (DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving comparable performance.
In just one round, each client distills their private dataset, sends the synthetic data (e.g. images or sentences) to the server, and collectively trains a global model.
The distilled data look like noise and are only useful to the specific model weights, <span id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> become useless after the model updates.
With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total communication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg while preserving between 93% to 99% performance of a centralized counterpart.
Afterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to finetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local datasets.
Through comprehensive experiments, we show the accuracy and communication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with different models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, <span id="id8.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc.</span>
We demonstrate that an eavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked distilled data, without knowing the initial model weights.
DOSFL serves as an inexpensive method to quickly converge on a performant pre-trained model with less than 0.1% communication cost of traditional methods.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional supervised learning dictates that data be gathered into a central location where it can be used to train a model.
However, this is intrusive and difficult, if data is spread across multiple devices or clients.
For this reason, federated learning (FL) has garnered attention due to its ability to collectively train neural networks while keeping data private.
The most popular FL algorithm is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Each iteration, clients perform local training and forward the resulting model weights to a server.
The server averages these to obtain a global model.
Since learning processes happen at local level, neither the server nor other clients directly observe a client’s data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning introduces distinct challenges not present in classical distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The main focus of this paper are expensive communication and statistical heterogeneity.
Previous approaches try to learn faster when data is poorly distributed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
They include modifying the training loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, using lifelong learning to prevent forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, and correcting local updates using control variates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
These methods improve upon FedAvg, but can still take hundreds of communication rounds, while increasing the amount of information sent to the server per round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by dataset distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, we propose Distilled One-shot Federated Learning (DOSFL) (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) to reduce the communication cost by up to 3 orders of magnitude.
DOSFL requires only one round of communication between a server and its clients.
Each client distills their data and uploads learned synthetic data, label and learning rate to the server, instead of transmitting bulky gradients or weights.
Even large datasets containing thousands of examples can be compressed to only a few fabricated examples.
The server then interleaves the clients’ distilled data together, using them to train a global model.
To achieve good results even when client data is poorly distributed, we leverage soft labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and introduce two new techniques: soft reset and random masking.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2009.07999/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="461" height="262" alt="Refer to caption">

(1) The server initializes a model which is broadcast to all clients. (2) Each client distills their private dataset and (3) transmits synthetic data, labels and learning rates to the server. (4) The server fits its model on the distilled data and (5) distributes the final model to all clients.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the reduction in rounds, we claim a communication reduction of up to 99.9% compared to FedAvg while achieving similar accuracy.
DOSFL can also preserve between 93% to 99% of centralized training’s performance when data is independently and identically distributed (IID).
Furthermore, under more challenging assumptions of low participation and asynchronous update with multiple rounds, DOSFL can achieve even better results and preserve higher centralized performance, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> almost 99% on IID Federated MNIST.
Unlike dataset compression, fabricated inputs in dataset distillation (see Appendix <a href="#A2.SS1" title="B.1 MNIST ‣ Appendix B Distilled Data ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a> and <a href="#A2.SS2" title="B.2 IMDB ‣ Appendix B Distilled Data ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.2</span></a>)—along with the corresponding labels and learning rate—are generated by a specific model weight distribution and become useless after the model updates.
We experimentally show that the final performance of a DOSFL is strongly dependent on the model parameters used to train on distilled data.
Without knowing the the exact initial weights distributed by the server, an eavesdropper cannot reproduce the global model with leaked distilled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We believe DOSFL is part of a new paradigm in the field of FL.
So far, nearly every FL algorithm communicates model weights or gradients.
While effective, breaking from this pattern offers many benefits, such as low communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or private model architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
We hope that DOSFL, along with related work, may inspire the machine learning community to explore possible techniques for weight-less and gradient-less FL.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the introduction of FedAvg in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, there has been an explosion of work directed towards the problem of statistical heterogeneity.
When statistical hetergeniety is high, convergence for FedAvg slows and becomes unstable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The issue is that, the difference between the local losses and the global objective—their weighted sum—may be large.
As such, minimizing a particular local loss does not ensure that the global loss is also minimized.
This is problematic, even when the losses are convex and smooth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
In applications where privacy loss can be tolerated, Zhao et al. demonstrate massive gains in performance
by making as little as 5% of data public <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous successors to FedAvg have been suggested.
Server momentum introduces a global momentum parameter that improves convergence theoretically and experimentally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In Shoham et al., the loss is modified with Elastic Weight Consolidation to prevent forgetting as clients perform local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
SCAFFOLD uses control variates, namely the gradient of the global model, to address drifting among clients during local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
These schemes, while effective, at least double the per round communication cost.
More efforts have not had this drawback.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposes several federated version of optimizers, FedAdaGrad, FedAdam and FedYogi, to provide better convergence for non-IID data.
The issue of objective inconsistency was discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and solved by the proposed FedNova, which averages the normalized local gradients.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While faster learning decreases the total number of communication rounds, strategies have been devised to explicitly reduce communication costs.
FedPAQ quantizes local updates before transmission, with averaging happens at both client and server sides <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Sparsifying the weights may perform better than FedAvg alone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Asynchronous model updates have also been explored, using adaptive weighted averaging to combat staleness, combined with a proximal loss, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and updating deeper layer less frequently than shallower layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
SAFA takes a semi-synchronous approach; only up-to-date and deprecated clients synchronize with the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A few papers have made first steps towards one-shot FL.
Guha et al. try different heuristics for selecting the client models which would form the best ensemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
By swapping weight averaging for ensembling, only one round of communication is necessary.
Upper and lower bounds have been proven for one-shot distributed optimization, along with an order optimal algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
The extent to which these results apply to FL of neural networks is unknown as the local losses must be convex and drawn from the same probability distribution.
Recently, knowledge distillation has been introduced to the field of FL to reduce the computation costs for edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In addition, group knowledge transfer reduces communication costs by accelerating convergence.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">There is a wealth of literature studying dataset compression, while maintaining the most crucial features for training models.
These methods include dataset pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and core set construction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which keep the examples that are measured to be more useful for training and remove the rest.
The drawback of drawing distilled images from the original dataset is that the level of compression achieved is much lower than that of dataset distillation, which is exempt from the requirement that distilled data be real <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Dataset distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> was introduced by Wang et al., to compress a large dataset with thousands to millions of images down to only a few synthetic training images.
The key idea is to use gradient descent to learn the features most helpful for rapidly training a neural network.

Soft labels have a long history, being proposed for model distillation by Hinton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and for k-nearest neighbors by El Gayar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

The random tensors randomly adjusts the model during training, while also reducing the amount of distilled data to actually train the starting parameters.
After the training iteration, the original distilled data are restored.
Now, sequences of distilled data can still train a model even when there is interference from other distilled steps.
However, resetting and storing distilled data is compute and memory intensive, which slows down distillation.</p>

Surprisingly, the behavior of these additions changes depending on the number of clients.
While accuracies in the 100 client case are lower in general, soft resets and no additions work better.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To show that DOSFL is not limited to image-based tasks, we test DOSFL on federated IMDB (sentiment analysis) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, federated TREC-6 (question classification) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and federated Sent140 (sentiment analysis) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Directly applying dataset distillation for language tasks is challenging as text data is discrete.
Each token is a one-hot vector with dimension equal to the number of tokens, which can be in the thousands.
To overcome this issue, we use pre-trained GloVe embeddings with a look up table to convert one-hot token ids to word vectors in 100D Euclidean space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Distilled sentences now are fixed-size real-valued matrices.
Real sentences are also padded or truncated to the same fixed length: 200 for federated IMDB and Sent140, 30 for federated TREC-6.</p>

We also provide the accuracy of non-IID FedAvg after an equivalent amount of communication.
This allows DOSFL and FedAvg to be compared in an equal communication cost setting.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">So far The above mentioned settings assumes synchronous full participation which is highly unlikely in the real-world.
We design an alternate version of DOSFL for when the participation rate is extremely low such that client communication is almost one-by-one.
First, the server selects only one client to distill its data.
Afterwards, the server updates the global model by training on the distilled data.
A different client then performs dataset distillation targeting the updated parameters.
This process repeats until each client has distilled their data.
Hence, the global model is updated <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math> times, once for each client.
The communication is highly serial; the next client can only begin distillation after the current client finishes.</p>

The reason for this is simple: when the clients’ datasets are IID, a model trained on one client’s dataset will transfer to the others.
Encouragingly, the server model achieves its final accuracy after as few as 15% of the clients finish dataset distillation.
This is true even when the data is non-IID, although it takes longer (around 40% of the clients).
Thus, the total amount of communication needed for LP-DOSFL is less than DOSFL.</p>

Break even rounds for federated MNIST, IMDB, TREC-6, and Sent140 are provided in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.1 Communication ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> along with the data and model size.
We also investigate potential communication savings when using larger models, such as Transformers, for Sent140.
The higher break even round for MNIST, compared to the text tasks, is due to LeNet having significantly fewer parameters than either TextCNN or Bi-LSTM.

The values for both quantities is shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1 Communication ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
For some tasks, FedAvg fails to converge due to having only 1 client update the gradient each round.
In general, DOSFL saves more communication when the size of the model increases or when the dataset becomes more challenging.
Besides MNIST, communication savings are up to 3 orders of magnitude.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">DOSFL provides an efficient way to trade computation and a few-to-none percentage points of accuracy for a great amount of communication cost reduction.
Next, clients can choose to either adopt another Federated Learning algorithm to continue improving the global model or personalize by training on local data.
As such, DOSFL is best suited for cross-silo FL, where 2-100 organizations seek to learn a shared model without sharing data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In cross-silo learning, participants likely would be able to dedicate hardware for the sole purpose of FL.
Big models are also probable, and the communication savings of DOSFL increase as the models get larger.
Computation resources are also cheaper to acquire compared to communication resources.
A company can purchase dedicated GPUs and use them for years at reasonable cost without losing much of their intrinsic value.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose the server or a client attempted to learn private information about other clients.
To the human eye, the distilled images or text appear random (see Appendix <a href="#A2.SS1" title="B.1 MNIST ‣ Appendix B Distilled Data ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.1</span></a>, <a href="#A2.SS2" title="B.2 IMDB ‣ Appendix B Distilled Data ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B.2</span></a>).
So the only known way to extract information from the distilled data is train the targeted model.
Because distilled data are targeted towards a <em id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">specific</em> initialization, training a differently initialized model on distilled data should result in a low accuracy model.
Therefore, we examine the security of DOSFL against an eavesdropping attack and show that an attacker cannot reproduce the global model without the server’s initial weights.
Referring to Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, assume that the attacker intercepts the distilled data, labels and learning rates from each client between Step 2 and 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">We assume that the model initialization, Step 1, is unknown to the attacker.
This can be easily achieved by being predefined offline or via encryption.
In Figure <a href="#S5.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Privacy and security ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>, the attacker does not have access to the model distribution and tries to guess different initialization methods.
All results are averages of 5 trials.
These include Xavier, Xavier uniform, Kaiming, Kaiming uniform, orthogonal and the default PyTorch initialization methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
All attacks fail to reproduce the same level of performance of the global model as most attacks struggle to reach over 50% accuracy.
The accuracy of the eavesdropper drops off with increased distance from the original model.

</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As such, the privacy of DOSFL should be <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">no worse</em> than plain FedAvg.
There are some security risks from other types of attacks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the authors used dataset distillation for data poisoning attacks.
Images were distilled such that, after one gradient descent step, the final model would misclassify the attack category.
However, this security risk is also present with FedAvg and most other FL algorithms: clients can deliberately upload poisoned weights to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
For DOSFL, bounding the gradient value or using momentum when training the global model on distilled data could mitigate this threat.
While defenses against other types of attacks are beyond the scope of this paper, we believe that existing differential privacy and secure multi-party computation tools will prove sufficient.</p>
