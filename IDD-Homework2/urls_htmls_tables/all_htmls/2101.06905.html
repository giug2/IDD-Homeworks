<p id="id4.4" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, promotes personal privacy by local data processing at each client. However, relying on a centralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into FL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In a round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to other clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes to generate a block before its local training of the next round.
We evaluate the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global loss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the number of overall aggregation rounds <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>, and optimize the computing resource allocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a critical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize others’ trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating behaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among the optimal <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients. Based on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental results are consistent with the analytical ones.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the amount of data from end devices is exploding at an unprecedented rate. Conventional machine learning (ML) technologies encounter the problem of how to efficiently collect distributed data from various IoT devices for centralized processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To tackle the issue raised by transmission bottleneck, distributed machine learning (DML) has emerged to process data at the network edge in a distributive manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. DML can alleviate the burden on the central server by dividing a task into sub-tasks assigned to multiple nodes. However, DML needs to exchange samples when training a task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, posing a serious risk of privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As such, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, proposed by Google as a novel DML paradigm, shows its potential advantages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In a FL system, a machine learning model is trained across multiple distributed clients with local datasets and then aggregated on a centralized server. FL is able to cooperatively implement machine learning tasks
without raw data transmissions, thereby promoting clients’ data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. FL has been applied to various data-sensitive scenarios, such as smart health-care, E-commerce <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and the Google project Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, due to centralized aggregations of models, standard FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions and external attacks, incurring either inaccurate model updates or even training failures. In order to solve this single-point-failure issue, blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> has been applied to FL systems. Leveraging advantages of blockchain techniques, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> developed a blockchain-enabled FL architecture to validate the uploaded parameters and investigated system performance, such as block generation rate and learning latency.
Most of the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>
have introduced a third-party blockchain network into FL systems, to benefit from a fully decentralized network at the expense of extra mining delay and mining consumption. Since model aggregations are fulfilled by miners in a decentralized manner, the blockchained FL can solve the single-point-failure problem. In addition, owing to a validation process of local training, FL can be extended to untrustworthy devices in a public network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To protect privacy and security of FL systems, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> developed a tamper-proof architecture that utilized blockchain to enhance system security when sharing parameters, and proposed a novel consensus mechanism, i.e., <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Proof of Quality</span> (PoQ), to optimize reward function. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> protected privacy of blockchained FL by using local differential privacy, and stand against poisoning attack by executing smart contract. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> applied consortium blockchain and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm into blockchained FL, to ensure the network reliability and safety with a trusted committee. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> investigated the robustness of blockchained FL against certain percentage of member attacks, and proposed a corresponding defence mechanism to protect the system. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed an autonomous blockchain based FL design for privacy-aware and efficient vehicular communication network, and achieved the system-level performance by adjusting parameters such as block size, block arrival rate, and retransmission limit.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Later, other works have investigated different directions of blockchain assisted FL. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed an incentive mechanism to encourage clients to follow the protocol of blockchained FL. The recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> modeled the computation and communication resource in the blockchained FL, and improved the utility between learning performance and resource consumption by controlling the number of local iterations in FL. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> showed the energy consumption model, and optimized the performance by allocating energy resources. The work in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> applied blockchained FL into industrial IoT for device failure detection, so that the system can be applied in reality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the above mentioned works resorted to blockchain architecture for avoiding single-point-failure, they inevitably introduced a third-party, i.e., miners rooted from blockchain, to store the aggregated models distributively, causing potential information leakage. Also, these works did not analyze the convergence performance of model training, which is important for evaluating FL learning performance. In addition, the consumption of resources, e.g., computing capability, caused by mining in blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> is generally not taken into account in these works. However, resources consumed by mining are not negligible compared with those consumed by FL model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, especially when mining with mobile phones has become a reality with the development of user terminals (e.g., mining for android.). Hence, blockchain-enabled FL needs to balance computational resource allocation between training and mining.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel blockchain assisted decentralized FL (BLADE-FL) architecture. In our BLADE-FL, training and mining processes are incorporated and implemented at each client, i.e., a client conducts both training and mining tasks with its own computing capability. The conventional framework that FL and blockchain are separated and respectively executed by training clients and miners can be deemed as a special case of resource allocation in our BLADE-FL. That is, in the conventional framework, a part of clients allocate all the computation resources for training, and the other part for mining only.</p>

Each client trains its local model, e.g., a deep neural network, based on its local data and transmits the trained model to the server. Upon receiving the weights from all the clients, the server performs a global model aggregation. There are a number of communication rounds for exchanging models between the server and clients. Each round consists of an uploading phase where the clients upload their local models, and a downloading phase where the server aggregates the model and broadcasts it to the clients. Clients then update their local models based on the global one.</p>

Thanks to the consensus mechanism, each transaction included in the newly generated block is immutable. The consensus mechanism validates the data within the blocks and ensures that all the nodes participating in the blockchain store the same data. The most prevalent consensus mechanism is <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Proof of Work</em> (PoW), used in the Bitcoin system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Bitcoin, the process of the block generation is as follows.

Then the nodes in blockchain verify the transaction by the signature.
Afterward, each node collects the verified transactions and competes to generate a new block that includes these transactions, by finding a unique, one-time number (called a <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">nonce</em>). This is to make the hash value of the data meet a specific target value. The node that finds the proper nonce is eligible to generate a new block and broadcasts the block to the entire network. Finally, the nodes validate the new block and append the verified block into the existing blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

In this distributed system, each client acts as not only a trainer but also a miner, and the role transition is designed as follows. First, each client (as a trainer) trains the local model, and then broadcasts the local model to the entire network as a requested transaction of the blockchain. Second, the client (as a miner) mines the block that includes all the local models that are ready for aggregation. Once the newly generated block is validated by the majority of clients, the verified models in the block are immutable. Without the intervention of any centralized server, each client performs the global aggregation to update its local model by using all the shared models in the validated block. Suppose that the uploading and downloading phases cannot be tampered with external attackers.</p>

In addition, a higher learning rate may lead to faster convergence but a less inaccurate local model.
To compensate for the inaccurate training, more computing power is allocated to the local training.
In practice, the learning rate is decided by the learning algorithm, and the learning rates of different learning algorithms are diverse.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Different from the conventional FL, a new problem of learning deficiency caused by lazy clients emerges in the BLADE-FL system. This issue is fundamentally originated from the lack of an effective detection and penalty mechanism in an unsupervised network such as blockchain, where the lazy client is able to plagiarize models from others to save its own computing power.
The lazy client does not contribute to the global aggregation, and even causes training deficiency and performance degradation.
To study this issue, we first model the lazy client in Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Model of Lazy Clients ‣ 5 Performance Analysis with Lazy clients ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>. Then, we develop an upper bound on the loss function to evaluate the learning performance of BLADE-FL with the presence of lazy clients in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Achievable Upper Bound with Lazy Clients ‣ 5 Performance Analysis with Lazy clients ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>. Next, we investigate the impact of the ratio of lazy clients and the power
of artificial noises on the learning performance in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Optimization on Performance with Lazy Clients ‣ 5 Performance Analysis with Lazy clients ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>.

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The inner privacy issue can be referred to privacy preserving schemes for decentralized FL in other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
When applying DP mechanism into BLADE-FL, we add a Gaussian noise with a small variance. Note that the DP mechanism solves the privacy leakage problem of FL, while our scheme solves the robust learning problem. These two problems are different and can be treated separately.
Besides, based on the developed upper bound in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem4" title="Theorem 4. ‣ 5.2 Achievable Upper Bound with Lazy Clients ‣ 5 Performance Analysis with Lazy clients ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we derive that a small noise does not affect the optimal integrated round. The optimal computing power allocation stays the same whether add DP or not. Thus, Clients in BLADE-FL can use DP mechanism to promoting their privacy without affecting the optimal computing power allocation of the system.
We show the experimental results in Subsection <a href="#S7.SS4" title="7.4 Experiments of Differential Privacy Mechanism ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7.4</span></a>.</p>

In this way, the method of privacy protection does not affect the optimal computing power allocation of BLADE-FL, which is consistent with the discussion of privacy of BLADE-FL in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Discussions on Privacy Issue ‣ Blockchain Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning (BLADE-FL): Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a BLADE-FL framework that integrates the training and mining process in each client, to overcome the single-point-failure of centralized network and maintain the privacy promoting capabilities of the FL system. In order to evaluate the learning performance of BLADE-FL, we have developed an upper bound on the loss function. Also, we have verified that the upper bound is convex with respect to the total number of integrated rounds <math id="S8.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> and have minimized the upper bound by optimizing <math id="S8.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S8.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S8.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S8.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p1.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>.
Moreover, we have investigated a unique problem in the proposed BLADE-FL system, called the lazy client problem and have derived an upper bound on the loss function with lazy clients. We have included experimental results, which have been seen to be consistent with the analytical results. In particular, the developed upper bound is close to the experimental results (e.g., the gap can be lower than <math id="S8.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="5\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">5</mn><mo id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p1.3.m3.1c">5\%</annotation></semantics></math>), and the optimal <math id="S8.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S8.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S8.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S8.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p1.4.m4.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> that minimizes the upper bound also reaches the minimum of the loss function in the experimental results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A few directions of future works are discussed as follows.
First, it is of interest to design an efficient incentive mechanism for BLADE-FL that encourages all clients to actively follow the protocol.
Second, another challenging issue of BLADE-FL is to detect plagiarism behaviors and discourage lazy clients. The detection of lazy clients will be addressed in our future work.</p>
