<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Computation offloading at lower time and lower energy consumption is crucial for resource limited mobile devices. This paper proposes an offloading decision-making model using federated learning. Based on the task type and the user input, the proposed decision-making model predicts whether the task is computationally intensive or not. If the predicted result is <span id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">computationally intensive</span>, then based on the network parameters the proposed decision-making model predicts <span id="id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whether to offload or locally execute</span> the task. According to the predicted result the task is either locally executed or offloaded to the edge server. The proposed method is implemented in a real-time environment, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved above 90% prediction accuracy in offloading decision-making. The experimental results also present that the proposed offloading method reduces the response time and energy consumption of the user device by <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>11-31% for computationally intensive tasks. A partial computation offloading method for federated learning is also proposed and implemented in this paper, where the devices which are unable to analyse the huge number of data samples, offload a part of their local datasets to the edge server. For secure data transmission, cryptography is used. The experimental results present that using encryption and decryption the total time is increased by only 0.05-0.16%. The results also present that the proposed partial computation offloading method for federated learning has achieved a prediction accuracy of above 98% for the global model.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The energy and latency-aware computation offloading has gained a significant research interest in the last few years with the rapid growth in wireless technology and the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT devices and the mobile devices including laptops, tablets, smartphones, have limited battery life and computational resources. In such a case, execution of computationally intensive tasks may not be feasible inside these mobile devices. However, if the device is able to execute the tasks then also it may take more time than offloading the task to the edge server or cloud. On the other hand, offloading of all the tasks may not be fruitful from the perspective of latency and energy consumption. For the tasks with less computations, offloading can consume more time than local execution. Hence, the decision of <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">offload or local execution</span> is important.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, the mobile devices have various types of recommendation applications, where model training is important. There are many applications which use reinforcement learning, machine learning, or deep learning algorithms to train the model. Further, local model training may not be always possible for the resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the user’s data is confidential and the user may not like to share the data with the server. Also, the large amount of data transmission to the server for analysis creates a huge overhead on the server as well as highly increase the network traffic. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is an emerging technology where the devices locally train models using their local datasets, and exchange model updates with the server. Finally, a global model is developed, and each device that serves as a client has a personalized model and the global model. The use of FL protects data privacy as no data sharing takes place, and through a collaborative learning a global model with high prediction accuracy can be obtained. However, the device may not able to analyse a large dataset using deep learning algorithms. In that case, the dataset is partitioned into two parts: one part is used for local model training, and the other part is offloaded to the server. However, during data offloading to the server, protection of data privacy is vital.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A mobile device has a computational task to execute. Now, the decision regarding whether to locally execute it or offload it to the edge server, is crucial with respect to the response time and energy consumption. Hence, a decision-making model is required to take the decision <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whether to offload or locally execute</span>. The data samples used for training may not be very high for a mobile device, and the network parameters’ values also change. In such a case, a deep learning model with comparatively small number of samples may not provide prediction with high accuracy. Further, the users’ data are different, and the local model weights are different. Thus, a collaborative training can provide a better prediction model so that the response time for task execution and energy consumption of the user device during the period can be minimal. The first motivation of this work to develop a collaborative decision-making model with high prediction accuracy to decide <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whether to offload or locally execute</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The use of FL for collaborative model training with privacy protection has gained popularity for various IoT applications. In centralized federated learning (CFL), the devices working as clients train local models with their own datasets, and exchange model updates with the server to build a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the devices form a collaborative network among themselves to exchange model updates for developing a generalized model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, the mobile devices may not be always able to locally train deep learning model using a huge number of data samples. In such a case, conventional CFL and DFL models may not be feasible. The second motivation of this work is to propose a secure partial computation offloading framework for FL to deal with this issue.</p>

As the network parameters like throughput, uplink and downlink traffic are dynamic and change over time, we use LSTM in this case as the underlying model to capture the sequential pattern.</p>

The user devices have large data samples, which are split into two parts. One part is used as the local dataset to train the local model, and the other part is offloaded to the edge server after encryption. The devices train their local models and exchange model updates with the edge server. The edge server after receiving data from the devices, trains a model with the received dataset after decryption, and stores the model update. After receiving model updates from the devices i.e. clients, the server performs aggregation considering the received updates as well as the stored update. The updated global model is then shared with the devices. In this work, we use symmetric key cryptography for data encryption during transmission to the edge server. However, the keys of individual devices are different.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The computation offloading is a significant research area of mobile cloud computing (MCC). Service delay minimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is one of the primary issues for mobile devices. The computation offloading from mobile device to the remote cloud suffered from delays, connectivity interruption, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The use of edge computing (EC) overcomes this problem by bringing resources at the network edge. The IoT/mobile devices are connected with the edge server, and the edge server is connected with the cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The mobile devices offload the resource exhaustive computations to the edge server. The edge server executes the computation and sends the result to the mobile device, or forwards the request to the cloud server. The cloud server after executing the computation sends the result. The computation offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) was discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The computation offloading in EC networks was illustrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> along with a discussion on optimization methods. A joint task offloading approach with resource allocation was proposed for MEC environment in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, user mobility-based computation offloading method was proposed using game theory. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the use of machine learning (ML) in computation offloading was reviewed. The reinforcement learning (RL) also gained popularity in computation offloading. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the use of RL in computation offloading was discussed in detail. The use of deep RL for task offloading was discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A deep RL-based method for action space recursive decomposition was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. FL with edge computing has gained popularity in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, an edge-based FL was proposed where the edge servers train their local models and exchange updates with the cloud to build the global model. However, in MEC-based FL, the mobile devices can also train their local models with own datasets and exchange model updates with the edge server that is connected with the cloud. The edge server performs aggregation in that case. The edge servers can also exchange their model updates with the cloud for developing a global model, and in that case cloud server acts as the aggregator. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, FL with deep RL was used for computation offloading. Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)-based FL was proposed for offloading decision-making and resource allocation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, FL was used for computation offloading in Edge-IoT systems. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, FL-based task offloading was proposed based on multi-feature matching. To mitigate the straggler effect of FL, an offloading method was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To deal with straggler effect and accelerate the local training in resource-constrained devices, offloading in FL was discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Limitations of existing approaches and comparison with proposed work:</span> In the existing FL-based offloading approaches, either the offloading decision-making using FL or partial computation offloading in FL, was explored. In our work, we propose a computation offloading decision-making framework using FL, as well as a partial computation offloading method for FL. Unlike the related works on offloading decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, we have not only measured the time and energy consumption for the proposed methods but also the accuracy and model loss for the proposed approaches.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">For the first objective, we use MLP as the underlying data analysis model. Based on the requested computational task and the respective input, it is predicted whether the task would be computationally intensive or not. For a computational task, the input plays an important role. For example, multiplication of two 3x3 matrices takes much less time to compute than the multiplication of two 300x300 matrices. Thus, based on the input as well as the task type (matrix operation, sorting, searching, etc.), it is decided whether it can be computationally intensive or not. To address the second objective, we use LSTM as the underlying model. Based on some network parameters such as network throughput, latency, uplink and downlink traffic, etc., it is decided whether to offload the task or not.

In FL, each of the participating device needs to locally train the model with its local dataset. However, model training with a large number of data samples may not be feasible for all the devices. In that case, the devices put a portion of their datasets to the server. The server trains the model with the offloaded datasets and stores the model. During aggregation, the server considers this trained model also along with the received model updates from the devices. However, how much portion of data will be offloaded that is significant. Further, data security during offloading to the server is another issue. The objective is to propose a secure federated offloading method with good prediction accuracy and minimal loss.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have considered different tasks in our experiment. The FL-based model is used for offloading decision-making. At first the model is used to check whether the requested task is computationally intensive or not based on the input features such as task type and the input. If the task is predicted as computationally intensive, then, based on the input features such as uplink traffic, downlink traffic, bandwidth, latency, etc., the decision is taken whether to offload or locally execute it. For the tasks with simple computation usually local execution is performed. However, sometimes the user may need to remotely access the content or result of computation. Thus, we have considered user preference also when a request is received. If the user looks for remote access, the task is offloaded to the cloud through the edge server. Otherwise, based on the outcome of the FL-based decision-making model, the task is either locally executed or offloaded to the edge server. The response time for the considered task execution scenarios and the energy consumption of the user device during the period, are presented in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-A3 Task offloading, Response time, and Energy consumption of user device ‣ IV-A Performance of FLDec ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ A Joint Time and Energy-Efficient Federated Learning-based Computation Offloading Method for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.</p>

Most of the user devices contain this basic application, which can work irrespective of the Internet connectivity. The user inputs numbers, and the calculator generates the results according to the requested operation. As the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">second task type</span>, we have considered matrix multiplication, where based on the order taken as input from the user, it is decided whether it would be computationally intensive or not. If the prediction result is <span id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">computationally intensive</span>, the FL-based decision-making model is used to predict whether to offload or not based on the present network throughput, uplink and downlink traffic, etc. Based on the prediction result, the task is either offloaded or locally executed. Here, we have considered four different cases. For the first case, the two matrices are of order 50x50, and based on the prediction result, the task has been executed locally. The response time and energy consumption of the device during the period are measured, and presented in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-A3 Task offloading, Response time, and Energy consumption of user device ‣ IV-A Performance of FLDec ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ A Joint Time and Energy-Efficient Federated Learning-based Computation Offloading Method for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.

Hence, we observe that if all the considered tasks are locally executed, then for higher order matrix multiplication, the response time and energy consumption would be high. Similarly, if all the considered tasks are offloaded, for calculator, the response time and energy consumption would be high for all of the considered operations, and for matrix multiplication the first scenario would take more time and the energy consumption also would be high. Thus, from the results we observe that the proposed FL-based decision-making model has taken appropriate decisions for the considered case studies, and reduced the response time and energy consumption.</p>

The portion of data to be offloaded has been encrypted using Fernet cryptography, and then sent to the server. Fernet is a symmetric key cryptography method, which is based on AES-128 for encryption and HMAC using SHA256 for authentication. As symmetric key cryptography is used, the same key is used for encryption as well as decryption. However, all the devices have different keys. As the latency is vital, we have considered symmetric key cryptography in FedOff that can protect data security but at lower time consumption. We have measured the latency in data transmission from the experiment.</p>

The average energy consumption of the devices during the total period are presented in Fig. <a href="#S4.F18" title="Figure 18 ‣ IV-B2 Prediction accuracy ‣ IV-B Performance of FedOff ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ A Joint Time and Energy-Efficient Federated Learning-based Computation Offloading Method for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>.

<p id="S5.p1.3" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes an FL-based offloading decision-making model for mobile devices. Based on the task type and the user input, the FL-based decision-making model predicts whether the task is computationally intensive or not, using MLP. If the predicted result is <span id="S5.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">computationally intensive</span>, then the proposed FL-based decision-making model predicts <span id="S5.p1.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whether to offload or locally execute</span> the task based on the network parameters, using LSTM. Based on the predicted result the task is either locally executed or offloaded to the edge server. If the edge server is unable to execute it or if the user preference is remote execution, then, the task is offloaded to the cloud. The experimental results present that the proposed offloading decision-making method has achieved above 90% prediction accuracy, and the considered case scenarios show that the proposed method provides the result at lower response time and lower energy consumption of the user device. The results also present that the proposed offloading method has reduced the response time by <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>11-31% for computationally intensive tasks. We have also proposed a partial computation offloading method for FL in this paper, where the user devices offload a part of their local dataset to the edge server if they are unable to analyse a huge dataset. For secure data transmission at lower time symmetric key cryptography has been used. The experimental results show that the proposed partial computation offloading method for FL has achieved <math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&gt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><gt id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1"></gt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">&gt;</annotation></semantics></math>98% accuracy for the global model and <math id="S5.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&gt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.3.m3.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1b"><gt id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1"></gt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1c">&gt;</annotation></semantics></math>94% accuracy for the local models. The results also present that the use of cryptography increases the time by 0.05-0.16% but ensures data privacy protection during transmission.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As part of our future work, we will extend the proposed work to enhance prediction accuracy in situations such as when the user’s requested task does not fall in the trained task category or the input provided for the task fall apart from the training dataset. Generative artificial intelligence can be used with FL for providing a good prediction model if the training dataset has a very limited number of samples.</p>
