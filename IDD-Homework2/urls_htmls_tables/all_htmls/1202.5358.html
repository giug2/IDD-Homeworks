<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy is a strong notion for protecting individual privacy in privacy preserving data analysis or publishing.
In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private histogram release for random workloads. We study two multidimensional partitioning strategies including: 1) a baseline cell-based partitioning strategy for releasing an equi-width cell histogram, and 2) an innovative 2-phase kd-tree based partitioning strategy for releasing a v-optimal histogram. We formally analyze the utility of the released histograms and quantify the errors for answering linear queries such as counting queries. We formally characterize the property of the input data that will guarantee the optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we implement and experimentally evaluate several applications using the released histograms, including counting queries, classification, and blocking for record linkage and show the benefit of our approach.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As information technology enables the collection, storage, and usage of massive amounts of information
about individuals and organizations, privacy becomes an increasingly important issue. Governments and organizations recognize the critical value in sharing such information while preserving the privacy of individuals. Privacy preserving data analysis and data publishing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> has received considerable attention in recent years.
There are two models for privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>: the interactive model and the non-interactive model.
In the interactive model, a trusted <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">curator</span> (e.g. hospital)
collects data from <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">record owners</span> (e.g. patients) and provides an access mechanism for <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data
users</span> (e.g. public health researchers) for querying or analysis purposes. The result returned from
the access mechanism is perturbed by the mechanism to protect privacy. In the non-interactive model, the curator publishes a
“sanitized” version of the data,
simultaneously providing utility for data users and privacy protection for the individuals represented in the data.</p>

is widely accepted as one of the strongest known privacy guarantees
with the advantage that it makes few assumptions on the attacker’s
background knowledge. It requires the outcome of computations to be
formally indistinguishable when run with or without any particular
record in the dataset, as if it makes little difference whether an
individual is being opted in or out of the database. Many meaningful
results have been obtained for the interactive model with
differential privacy

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private histogram release based on a differential privacy interface, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 DPCube: Two-Phase Partitioning ‣ 4 Multidimensional Partitioning ‣ DPCube: Differentially Private Histogram Release through Multidimensional Partitioning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. A <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">histogram</span> is a disjoint partitioning of the database points with the number of points which fall into each partition. A differential privacy interface, such as the Privacy INtegrated Queries platform (PINQ) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, provides a differentially private access to the raw database. An algorithm implementing the partitioning strategy submits a sequence of queries to the interface and generates a differentially private histogram of the raw database. The histogram can then serve as a sanitized synopsis of the raw database and, together with an optional synthesized dataset based on the histogram, can be used to support count queries and other types of OLAP queries and learning tasks.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">An immediate question one might wonder is what is the advantage of the non-interactive release compared to using the interactive mechanism to answer the queries directly. A common mechanism providing differentially private answers is to add carefully calibrated noise to each query determined by the privacy parameter and the sensitivity of the query. The composability of differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> ensures privacy guarantees for a sequence of differentially-private computations with additive privacy depletions in the worst case. Given an overall privacy requirement or budget, expressed as a privacy parameter, it can be allocated to subroutines or each query in the query sequence to ensure the overall privacy. When the number of queries grow, each query gets a lower privacy budget which requires a larger noise to be added. When there are multiple users, they have to share a common privacy budget which degrades the utility rapidly. The non-interactive approach essentially exploits the data distribution and the query workload and uses a carefully designed algorithm or query strategy such that the overall noise is minimized for a particular class of queries. As a result, the partitioning strategy and the algorithm implementing the strategy for generating the query sequence to the interface are crucial to the utility of the resulting histogram or synthetic dataset.</p>

There are several innovative features in our 2-phase strategy. First, we incorporate a uniformity measure in the partitioning process which seeks to produce partitions that are close to uniform so that approximation errors within partitions are minimized, essentially resulting in a differentially private v-optimal histogram. Second, we implement the strategy using a two-phase algorithm that generates the kd-tree partitions based on the cell histogram so that the access to the differentially private interface is minimized.</p>

We briefly review here the most relevant work to our paper and discuss how our work differs from existing work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a series of studies on interactive privacy preserving data analysis based on
the notion of differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
A primary approach proposed for achieving differential privacy is to add Laplace noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to the original results.
McSherry and Talwar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> give an alternative method to implement differential privacy based on the probability of a returned result, called the exponential mechanism.
Roth and Roughgarden <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes a median mechanism which improves upon the Laplace mechanism.
McSherry implemented the interactive data access mechanism into PINQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a platform providing a programming interface through a SQL-like language.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A few works started addressing non-interactive data release that achieves differential privacy. Blum et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proved the possibility of
non-interactive data release satisfying differential privacy for
queries with polynomial VC-dimension, such as predicate queries. It
also proposed an inefficient algorithm based on the exponential
mechanism. The result largely remains theoretical and the general
algorithm is inefficient for the complexity and required data size. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> further proposed more efficient algorithms
with hardness results obtained and it remains a key open problem to
find efficient algorithms for non-interactive data release with
differential privacy for many domains.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> pointed out that a natural approach to side-stepping the hardness is relaxing the utility requirement, and not requiring accuracy for <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">every</span> input database.</p>

Xiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> developed an algorithm using wavelet transforms. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> generates differentially private histograms for single dimensional range queries through a hierarchical partitioning approach and a consistency check technique.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes a query matrix mechanism that generates an optimal query strategy based on the query workload of linear count queries and further mapped the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> as special query strategies that can be represented by a query matrix. It is worth noting that the cell-based
partitioning in our approach is essentially the identity query
matrix referred in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. While we will leverage the query matrix framework to formally analyze our approach, it is important to note that the above mentioned query strategies are data-oblivious in that they are determined by the query workload, a static wavelet matrix, or hierarchical matrix without taking into consideration the underlying data. On the other hand, our 2-phase kd-tree based partitioning is designed to explicitly exploit the smoothness of the underlying data indirectly observed by the differentially private interface and the final query matrix corresponding to the released histogram is dependent on the approximate data distribution. We are also aware of a forthcoming work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and will compare with it as the proceedings becomes available.</p>

<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our work complements and advances the above works in that we focus on differentially private histogram release for random query workload using a multidimensional partitioning approach that is “data-aware”.

Our approach provides formal utility guarantees for a class of queries and also supports a variety of applications including general OLAP, classification and record linkage.</p>

The composability of differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> ensures privacy guarantees for a sequence of differentially-private computations. For a general series of analysis, the privacy parameter values add up, i.e. the privacy guarantees degrade as we
expose more information. In a special case that the analyses
operate on disjoint subsets of the data, the ultimate privacy guarantee depends only on the worst of the guarantees of each analysis, not the sum.</p>

A privacy interface such as PINQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> can be used to provide a differentially private interface to a database. It provides operators for database aggregate
queries such as count (<span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">NoisyCount</span>) and sum (<span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">NoisySum</span>) which uses Laplace noise and
the exponential mechanism to enforce differential privacy.
It also provides a <span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Partition</span> operator that can partition the dataset based on the provided set of candidate keys.
The <span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Partition</span> operator takes advantage of parallel
composition and thus the privacy costs do not add up.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, a finer-grained partitioning will introduce smaller approximation errors but larger aggregated perturbation errors. Finding the right balance to minimize the overall error for a random query workload is a key question. Not surprisingly, finding the optimal multi-dimensional histogram, even without the privacy constraints, is a challenging problem and optimal partitioning even in two dimensions is NP-hard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Motivated by the above example and guided by the composition theorems, we summarize our two design goals: 1) generate uniform or close to uniform partitions so that the approximation error within the partitions is minimized, essentially generating a v-optimal histogram <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>; 2) carefully and efficiently use the privacy budget to minimize the perturbation error. In this paper, we first study the most fine-grained cell-based partitioning as a baseline strategy, which results in a equi-width histogram and does not introduce approximation error but only perturbation error. We then propose a 2-phase kd-tree (k-dimensional tree) based partitioning strategy that results in an v-optimal histogram and seeks to minimize both the perturbation and approximation error.</p>

The key innovation of our algorithm is that it is data-aware or adaptive because the multi-dimensional kd-tree based partitioning is based on the cell-histogram from the first phase and hence exploits the underlying data distribution indirectly observed by the perturbed cell-histogram. Essentially, the kd-tree is based on an approximate distribution of the original data. The original database is not queried during the kd-tree construction which saves the privacy budget. The overall privacy budget is efficiently used and divided between the two phases only for querying the NoisyCount for cells and partitions.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The key step in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.3 DPCube: Two-Phase Partitioning ‣ 4 Multidimensional Partitioning ‣ DPCube: Differentially Private Histogram Release through Multidimensional Partitioning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is the multi-dimensional partitioning step. It uses a kd-tree based space partitioning strategy that seeks to produce close to uniform partitions in order to minimize the estimation error within a partition.
It starts from the root node which covers the entire space. At each step, a splitting dimension and a split value from the range of the current partition on that dimension are chosen heuristically to divide the space into subspaces. The algorithm repeats until a pre-defined requirement are met.
In contrast to traditional kd-tree index construction which desires a balanced tree, our main design goal is to generate uniform or close to uniform partitions so that the approximation error within the partitions is minimized. Thus we propose a uniformity based heuristic to make the decision whether to split the current partition and to select the best splitting point. There are several metrics that can be used to measure the uniformity of a partition such as information entropy and variance. In our experiments, we use variance as the metric. Concretely, we do not split a partition if its variance is greater than a threshold, i.e. it is close to uniform, and split it otherwise. In order to select the best splitting point, we choose the dimension with the largest range and the splitting point that minimizes the accumulative weighted variance of resulting partitions. This heuristic is consistent with the goal of a v-optimal histogram which places the histogram bucket boundaries to minimize the cumulative weighted variance of the buckets.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once the histograms are released, given a random user query, the estimation component will compute an answer using the released histograms. We study two techniques and formally quantify and compare the errors of the query answer they generate. The first one estimates the query answer using only the subcube histogram assuming a uniform distribution within each partition. As an alternative approach, we adopt the least squares (LS) method, also used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, to our two-phase strategy. The basic idea is to use both cell histogram and subcube histogram and find an approximate solution of the cell counts to resolve the inconsistency between the two histograms.</p>

The difference is that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> defines only the upper bound, while our definition below defines the bound of differences of all cell counts.

Classification is a common data analysis task. Several recent works studied classification with differential privacy by designing classifier-dependent algorithms (such as decision tree) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The released histograms proposed in this paper can be also used as training data for training a classifier, offering a classifier-independent approach for classification with differential privacy.
To compare the approach with existing solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we have chosen an ID3 tree classifier algorithm.
However, the histograms can be used as training data for any other classifier.</p>

<p id="S5.p4.3" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p4.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Blocking for Record Linkage.</span>
Private record linkage between datasets owned by distinct parties is another common and challenging problem. In many situations, uniquely identifying information may not be available and linkage is performed based on matching of other information, such as age, occupation, etc. Privacy preserving record linkage allows two parties to identify the records that represent the same real world entities without disclosing additional information other than the matching result.

The purpose of blocking is to divide a dataset into mutually exclusive blocks assuming no matches occur across different blocks. It reduces the number of record pairs to compare for the SMC protocols but meanwhile we need to devise a blocking scheme that provides strong privacy guarantee. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> has proposed a hybrid approach with a differentially private blocking step followed by an SMC step. The differentially private blocking step adopts tree-structured space partitioning techniques and uses Laplace noise at each partitioning step to preserve differential privacy. The matching blocks are then sent to SMC protocols for further matching of the record pairs within the matching blocks which significantly reduces the total number of pairs that need to be matched by SMC.</p>

The results for the uniform estimation method present interesting trends. For smoothly distributed data, a smaller privacy budget for the partitioning phase yields better result. Intuitively, since data is smoothly distributed, it is beneficial to save the privacy budget for the second phase to get a more accurate overall partition count. On the contrary, for the random case, it is beneficial to spend the privacy budget in the first phase to get a more accurate cell counts, and hence more accurate partitioning.</p>

We now evaluate the quality of the released histogram using an application-independent metric, the weighted variance of the released subcube histogram. Ideally, our goal is to obtain a v-optimal histogram which minimizes the weighted variance so as to minimize the estimation error within partitions. Formally, the weighted variance of a histogram is defined as <math id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="V=\sum_{i=1}^{p}x_{i}V_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">V</mi><mo rspace="0.111em" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><msubsup id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mo id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.2.cmml">∑</mo><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.3.cmml">p</mi></msubsup><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml"><msub id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.2.cmml">V</mi><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑉</ci><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3"><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1">subscript</csymbol><sum id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.2"></sum><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3"><eq id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.2">𝑖</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.2.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.3">𝑝</ci></apply><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2"><times id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.1"></times><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.2">𝑉</ci><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.3.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">V=\sum_{i=1}^{p}x_{i}V_{i}</annotation></semantics></math>, where <math id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p3.2.m2.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math> is the number of

We can see that for queries with reasonable sizes, our 2-phase algorithm achieves better results than the consistency check algorithm.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a two-phase multidimensional partitioning algorithm with estimation algorithms for differentially private histogram release.
We formally analyzed the utility of the released histograms and quantified the errors for answering linear counting queries. We showed that the released v-optimal histogram combined with a simple query estimation scheme achieves bounded query error and superior utility than existing approaches for “smoothly” distributed data.
The experimental results on using the released histogram for random linear counting queries and additional applications including classification and blocking for record linkage showed the benefit of our approach.
As future work, we plan to develop algorithms that are both data- and workload-aware to boost the accuracy for specific workloads and investigate the problem of releasing histograms for temporally changing data.</p>
