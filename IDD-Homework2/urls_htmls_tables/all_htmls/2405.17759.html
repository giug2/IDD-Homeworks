<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">To enable wireless federated learning (FL) in communication resource-constrained networks, two communication schemes, i.e., digital and analog ones, are effective solutions. In this paper, we quantitatively compare these two techniques, highlighting their essential differences as well as respectively suitable scenarios. We first examine both digital and analog transmission schemes, together with a unified and fair comparison framework under imbalanced device sampling, strict latency targets, and transmit power constraints. A universal convergence analysis under various imperfections is established for evaluating the performance of FL over wireless networks. These analytical results reveal that the fundamental difference between the digital and analog communications lies in whether communication and computation are jointly designed or not. The digital scheme decouples the communication design from FL computing tasks, making it difficult to support uplink transmission from massive devices with limited bandwidth and hence the performance is mainly communication-limited. In contrast, the analog communication allows over-the-air computation (AirComp) and achieves better spectrum utilization. However, the computation-oriented analog transmission reduces power efficiency, and its performance is sensitive to computation errors from imperfect channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, device sampling for both schemes are optimized and differences in sampling optimization are analyzed. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and affirm the superior performance of the sampling optimization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The dramatic development of data science has catalyzed significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), which is driving innovation for anticipated sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. The integration of AI and communication is envisioned to drive the shift from connected things to ubiquitous connected intelligence in wireless networks, supporting a large number of emerging intelligent applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Nonetheless, traditional centralized learning paradigms depend on extensive data transmission and considerable computational resources at cloud servers, which is challenging to implement in wireless networks. To better embrace AI, edge learning (EL) is viewed as a promising distributed learning technique that harnesses massive data and computational capacity available in edge devices distributed across wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Distinguishing it from the traditional separate design for computation and communication, EL integrates the two and achieves efficient utilization of resources and improves performance through learning task-oriented communication design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, a key EL paradigm, namely federated learning (FL), has garnered significant attention from both academic and industrial circles, primarily due to its communication-efficient and privacy-enhancing characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In FL, distributed edge devices utilize local datasets to collaboratively train a shared learning model with the assistance of a central parameter server (PS). By exchanging model parameters instead of raw data, the PS iteratively updates the global model until convergence. FL scheme minimizes the amount of transmitted data, as well as helping safeguard privacy and security. Recent studies have explored implementation of FL algorithms at wireless edge to support emerging AI applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, limited communication resources has posed a significant bottleneck to the performance of wireless FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. One particular concern regards the uplink transmission process, where numerous participating devices need to transmit local updates to the PS, leading to a substantial increase in communication overhead and transmission latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Hence, the development of efficient uplink transmission is crucial to enable wireless FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To support data transmission in wireless FL, digital communication schemes have been widely considered in recent works, where local updates are quantized into finite bits and then transmitted to the PS via traditional frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. At the receiver, the PS relies on channel coding for error detection and correction, before model aggregation using the received local updates. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors characterized the impact of packet errors on the convergence of FL, which enabled a task-oriented communication resource allocation scheme. The influence of various finite-precision quantization schemes in uplink and downlink communications was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Building upon convergence analysis of the quantized FL, the quantization bits allocation was optimized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to adapt channel diversity and requirements of the FL tasks. To further alleviate the communication bottleneck, one-bit quantization technique and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) were used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to reduce communication overhead and enhance communication reliability, respectively.
Apart from resource allocation methods, modifications from the algorithmic perspective have been considered to combat unreliable transmissions. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a user datagram protocol (UDP)-based robust training algorithm, which asymptotically achieved the same convergence rate as that with error-free communications. Moreover in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, for replacing erroneous local updates, a global model reusing scheme, namely the GoMORE scheme, was devised to successfully mitigate the negative impacts of packet loss. Alternatively, another solution is to further squeeze the communication overhead, thus improving the convergence over resource-constrained networks. The model pruning in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> was seen to be an effective way to compress the large-scale model into a smaller size, facilitating communication-efficient FL design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to these digital communication schemes, analog communication is an alternative communication-efficient way for deploying wireless FL. In particular, the local updates are amplitude-modulated and then simultaneously transmitted by reusing the available radio resource. Due to the superposition property of radio channels, the global model can be computed automatically over-the-air, which is therefore referred to as over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Unlike the digital paradigm, analog communication pushes model aggregation from the PS to the air, which not only functionally but physically integrates the computation and communication. Benefiting from the over-the-air aggregation, the communication latency is substantially reduced and the spectrum utilization is much more efficient, leading to fast-convergent and communication-efficient FL. It was shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> that the convergence rate of centralized learning remains approachable with this analog approach without power control and beamforming. Furthermore in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, to combat deep fading, a novel truncated channel inversion scheme was proposed to exclude devices experiencing deep fades from the training process avoiding excessive energy consumption. Further insights into analog aggregation schemes were also discussed in the context of fundamental trade-offs between communication and learning. Besides, the impact of over-the-air aggregation errors on optimality gap was analyzed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> with power control optimization. Furthermore, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed an AirComp-based adaptive reweighing scheme for the aggregation, and jointly considered the power control and device selection deign based on the derived optimality gap. To combat the additive noise, robust FL training methods were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> for both the expectation-based and the worst-case noise models. Considering multi-antenna scenarios, the beamforming design at the receiver was optimized by solving a sparse and low-rank optimization problem in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. In practice, considering the lack of perfect channel state information (CSI) for accurate power control, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> investigated the impact of CSI uncertainty at the transmitter on FL convergence and revealed that CSI imperfection plays an key factor affecting the AirComp performance and convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, by incorporating learning task-oriented resource allocation, both digital and analog transmissions are effective ways to fulfill the communication requirements of wireless FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
In traditional communication for data transmission, digital communication schemes have been proven not only in theory but also in practice as dominantly outperforming analog communication techniques in almost all cases of interest. In communications for computation tasks, however, analog communication has shown to be exceptionally effective in some cases of resource-constrained networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Hence, it is of interest to comprehensively compare digital and analog transmissions for wireless FL. Several recent studies have compared the two communication paradigms from some specific perspectives, including communication latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and convergence performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of literature that presents a comprehensive and quantitative comparison between the two fundamental communication paradigms, especially under practical constraints. Also, there have been few attempts to elucidate the fundamental differences between digital and analog transmissions in the context of FL, which is crucial for its deployment and design.</p>

Due to the non-IID nature of the data, misaligned inclusion probability may bias the global model away from the local optimum, thereby decelerating the convergence and causing performance loss. Hence, in the following sections, we focus on the performance evaluation under fixed inclusion probabilities and characterize the impact of device sampling for wireless FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p3.3" class="ltx_p">The transmission delay under the digital transmission is primarily influenced by stragglers, which refer to devices with poor channel conditions. To avoid the uncontrolled severe delay brought by stragglers, we assume that all the devices transmit the local updates at a fixed rate rather than a dynamic one based on instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Hence, the use of a fixed-rate transmission acts as a truncation mechanism for stragglers. Additionally, for devices experiencing favorable channel conditions, it is more beneficial to transmit at a lower rate with enhanced transmission reliability.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the analog transmission with AirComp, selected devices simultaneously upload the uncoded analog signals of local gradients to the PS by fully reusing the time-frequency resource. A weighted summation of the local updates in (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In item 4) ‣ II-A Federated Learning Model ‣ II System Model and Communication Framework ‣ Wireless Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Networks: Digital versus Analog Transmissions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) can be achieved by exploiting channel pre-equalization and the waveform superposition nature of the wireless channel. In this study, we consider that the total bandwidth is constrained for fair comparison and all subbands are utilized for the transmission of identical parameters. This is because the uncoded nature of the analog transmission diminishes its robustness, rendering it more vulnerable to interference and even the malicious attacks.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>The derived results directly extend to the case of dividing bandwidth for distinct parameter transmission in broadband scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although both the digital and analog transmissions achieve unbiased gradient estimations, there are fundamental differences in the distortion between the two paradigms. For the digital transmission, the distortion mainly lies in the gradients themselves, i.e., gradient quantization errors. On the other hand, due to the integration of communication and computation in AirComp, the analog transmission additionally suffers from distortion in coefficient aggregation, i.e., computation error, which is due to the CSI imperfection. This essential difference further discriminates the performances of digital and analog transmissions, which are elaborated in the next section.</p>

<p id="Thmremark3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As SNR increases, the optimality gap for the analog case mainly comes from the non-IID datasets while the impact of the noise asymptotically diminishes. For the digital case, however, quantization errors additionally impose an impact. Under the analog transmission, the negative impact of non-IID datasets is enlarged due to imperfect AirComp. Imperfect CSI results in mismatched channel inversion in AirComp, rendering perfect computation of weighted sum impossible.
Moreover, the performance degradation brought by imperfect CSI in the analog transmission cannot be mitigated by occupying more resources. Conversely, in the digital transmission, the convergence performance can be improved by occupying additional resources for increasing the number of quantization bits.

Compared with the maximum transmit power budget, a smaller optimality gap for the analog transmission is achieved with the average power budget. Due to the need for channel alignment in AirComp, the performance is dominantly limited by the device with the worst channel condition. Furthermore, the strict peak power constraint amplifies the impact of worst-case channel conditions, resulting in looser convergence performance compared to the long-term constraint.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the digital transmission, the FL performance can primarily be improved from two aspects, namely enhancing transmission reliability and optimizing resource utilization. Specifically, advanced transmissions strategies help minimize transmission errors and packet losses due to channel fading. Furthermore, if other resource allocation methods, such as the model compression design and device scheduling strategies, are exploited toward the FL tasks, they prioritize crucial parameter/device transmissions and thus lifting the resource utilization. On the other hand, in the analog transmission, the FL performance through AirComp is primarily influenced by the over-the-air computational accuracy. Optimized transceiver and power control designs help mitigate the negative impact of channel fading on the FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While further optimization of system designs enhances performance, it is essential to note that the performance limits for the digital and analog transmissions remains unchanged. As observed in the above analytical results, in the digital transmission paradigm, due to the decoupling of the communication and computation processes, the number of bits that can be accurately transmitted with the limited resources is determined, which places an upper bound of the FL performance. In contrast, within the analog transmissions, the receiver does not aim to recover information from individual sources but instead prioritizes the precision of computation results derived from the over-the-air superimposed signals, thereby making computational accuracy a decisive role. Hence, the performance limit of the analog transmission is contingent upon the channel estimation accuracy and additive noise level.</p>

<p id="Thmremark7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The optimal inclusion probability is positively correlated with the local dataset size while it behaves conversely correlated with the successful transmission probability. In other words, a device with a larger dataset is deemed more important for model training, thereby deserving a sampling bias. Conversely, devices with lower successful transmission probabilities contribute less to the model training process, requiring more frequent sampling to compensate. Thus, the goal of our inclusion probability optimization is to address the imbalances in the dataset size, and the heterogeneity introduced by uneven channel fading. It ensures fair and effective participation among diverse devices.

Furthermore, the increased complexity of FL tasks renders fluctuations in the performance curve more sensitive to noise. Consequently, in the analog communication, the superimposed white Gaussian noise is significantly severer than quantization errors observed in the digital transmission, thus leading to more pronounced fluctuations in convergence performance. It implies that for more complex learning tasks, it becomes imperative to further reduce the variance of gradient estimation to mitigate excessive fluctuations and their adverse impacts on convergence.</p>

It is observed that the digital transmission scheme outperforms the analog scheme, particularly with high SNR levels. In such cases, employing more quantization bits yields the best performance. Conversely, for low SNR levels, reducing the quantization bits leads to marginal performance loss, highlighting the flexibility of the digital schemes by selecting different quantization accuracies. On the other hand, the analog scheme faces significant performance limitations, particularly with the maximum transmit power budget and less CSI, due to the stringent requirements of channel inversion. Therefore, in terms of power utilization, the digital scheme is more efficient than the analog counterpart.</p>

The first two baselines neglect the influence of the wireless transmission process, resulting in performance degradation. The sampling method based on channel conditions tends to select devices with better channels, effectively reducing packet loss rates and yielding significant performance improvements. However, due to its oversight of imbalanced size of local datasets, its final performance remains inferior to our proposed method.

Furthermore, the baseline method of minimizing computational distortion overlooks the impact of data heterogeneity, thus impeding its ability to achieve satisfactory performance.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have provided a detailed comparison between digital and analog transmission enabled wireless FL. To this end, we considered general transmission designs for both schemes and conducted a fair comparison between them. Then, we analyzed the convergence behavior of wireless FL in terms of the convergence rate and optimality gap under digital and analog cases, and compared the convergence performance from multiple perspectives. It was found that digital transmission is more suitable for scenarios with sufficient radio resources and CSI uncertainties. On the other hand, analog transmission is suitable when their are massive numbers of participating devices. Next, we addressed sampling optimization for both cases, and further developed insights for optimization, which ars useful for practical deployment. Finally, experimental results illuminated the analytical results and the sampling strategies. Additionally, an explicit and precise characterization of data heterogeneity and targeted system designs with theoretical guarantees should be of our interest in the future work.</p>
