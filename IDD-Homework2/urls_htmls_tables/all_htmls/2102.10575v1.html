<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Current methods of Visual Question Answering perform well on the answers with an amount of training data but have limited accuracy on the novel ones with few examples. However, humans can quickly adapt to these new categories with just a few glimpses, as they learn to organize the concepts that have been seen before to figure the novel class, which are hardly explored by the deep learning methods. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to extract the attributes from the answers with enough data, which are later composed to constrain the learning of the few-shot ones. We generate the few-shot dataset of VQA with a variety of answers and their attributes without any human effort. With this dataset, we build our attribute network to disentangle the attributes by learning their features from parts of the image instead of the whole one. Experimental results on the VQA v2.0 validation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attribute network and the constraint between answers and their corresponding attributes, as well as the ability of our method to handle the answers with few training examples.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The developments in computer vision and natural language processing enable the machine to deal with complicated tasks that require the integration and understanding of vision and language, e.g. image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, visual grounding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, visual question answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and visual dialog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Compared with image captioning that is to simply describe the topic of an image, VQA needs a complex reasoning process to infer the right answer for a variety of questions. Visual grounding aims to locate the related objects in the image, but VQA takes a further step to convert this information into human language. In addition, VQA is the basic and vital component in visual dialog. Considering the challenges and significance of VQA, increasing research attention has been attracted to it.</p>

However, the categories of these visual tasks are isolated from each other and share few common characters. In contrast, the answers of VQA are compositional and combinations of them, like ‘cutting cake’, ‘red and yellow’, and ‘playing wii game’. Therefore, it brings VQA a wide range of answers with unbalanced data, and these answers share some common attributes. For example, in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Learning Compositional Representation for Few-shot Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, all of these answers in the top left row and right column have the same ‘riding’ action but different objects, among which ‘riding motorcycle’, ‘riding bike’, and ‘riding horse’ are easily recognized by the AI agent due to a number of training examples. Even though there are many examples of ‘elephant’ in the bottom left row, ‘riding elephant’ is still hard to be correctly classified because of few examples. However, humans can learn the novel category only with few glimpses, as we separate this new object into parts that we have ever known. As shown in the right column of Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Learning Compositional Representation for Few-shot Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we learn a good view of ‘riding’ with a number of examples in the images of the top row and the meaning of ‘elephant’ in the bottom row, after that, we can easily recognize ‘riding elephant’ by composing the two concepts.</p>

Visual Question Answering as a Meta Learning Task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is one of the handful researches for few-shot learning in VQA, it solves this problem from the view of meta-learning, which requires extra memory to store the weights of support set, and it only targets at the ‘number’ questions whose answers only vary from 0 to 6. Following MAML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Fast Parameter Adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> learns the proper initial weights for the image-text task, but the number of its categories is up to 20-way, limiting its use in reality.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to answer the general questions of VQA under the few-shot setting, which are more complex and have a variety of answers. We first create the base set for learning the backbone of our network and the novel set for few-shot answers. Both sets are from the training set of VQA v2.0 and do not need extra human effort to label the attributes of answers. Then we focus on learning the representation of attributes. The visual recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> use the mean of vectors (average pooling layer) from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), such as ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, GoogLeNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and ResNext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, for classification, as it describes the whole image, but the attributes come from the different parts of the image, such as ‘riding’ from the upper part and ‘elephant’ from the lower part of the image in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Learning Compositional Representation for Few-shot Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Therefore, we propose the attribute network to make each part of the image score the attributes individually. At last, we model the constraint between the answers and their corresponding attributes in the base set, which later are transferred to learn the representation of few-shot answers in the novel set.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">VQA is a task to answer the given question based on the input image. The question is usually embedded into a vector with LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and the image is represented by the fixed-size grid features extracted from a pre-trained model, such as ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Then both of these features are projected into a joint embedding by addition or concatenation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which is used for answer prediction through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). However, not all features of the image are related to the given question, while some of them should be filtered out before generating the unified vector, therefore attention mechanism is introduced to learn the weight of each grid feature, such as Stack Attention Networks (SAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and Dual Attention Networks (DAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

Furthermore, Bilinear Attention Networks (BAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> learn the textual and visual attention simultaneously, which builds a mapping from the detected objects of the image to the words of the question. By interpreting BAN as a graph, Bilinear Graph Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> takes a further step to build the relationships between objects and words by the image-graph as well as between words and words by the question-graph.

Apart from these two categories, data augmentation methods, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> learn a generator in the base data and use it to hallucinate the new novel data. Moreover, A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> compares these representative algorithms and develops a simple baseline approach on top of the frozen CNN, which achieves state-of-the-art on both mini-ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> and CUB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> datasets.</p>

With modeling the transformation network of these compositional attributes, From Red Wine to Red Tomato <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> can category the unseen combination of concepts. Measuring compositionality in representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> builds a new evaluation metric to estimate the sum of attributes that describes the input image. Dense Attribute-Based Attention<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> assigns the region features from the image to their semantic vectors from GloVe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Learning Compositional Representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> disentangles the feature space of categories into sub-spaces corresponding to their attributes, which is similar to our method, but it omits that each part of the encoded features makes a different contribution to the attributes.</p>

But the attributes in the right answer may come from the different parts of the given image and should be handled separately. For example, in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-B Learning Compositional Representation ‣ III Methods ‣ Learning Compositional Representation for Few-shot Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the phrase ‘what is’ focuses on the object of ‘horse’ (object 2), while ‘woman doing’ pays more attention to the object of ‘woman’ (object 16). Therefore, we propose the attribute network to compute the score between each node of the graph and the attributes respectively instead of a whole one:</p>

In the second image of the bottom row, BGN cannot correctly answer the question. Because in the base stage, when it comes up with ‘pizza’ in the image that appears in the right answer, it is always related to ‘eating’ in the question, which is a strong bias learned by the BGN model as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-F Qualitative Analysis ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Learning Compositional Representation for Few-shot Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. In contrast, our model learns the ‘cutting’ action from other examples besides ‘pizza’, like ‘cake’, ‘apple’, and ‘paper’. In the novel stage, the attributes of ‘cutting’ and ‘pizza’ detected in the given image are used to improve the representation of the answer ‘cutting pizza’. Similar problems are also found in the third image of the top row (people sit on the bench) and the first image of the bottom row (cat sits on the couch). Moreover, an object is always pictured with multiple colors, such as the fourth image of the top row and the third image of the bottom row. Apart from learning the vector of new combination color from scratch in the novel stage, we utilize the well-trained representation of the single color in the base stage to enhance it without extra human effort on annotation. This is also applied to find the objects in the image, such as vase and flowers in the second image of the top row and spoon and fork in the fourth image of the bottom row.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we apply the few-shot setting to the general VQA problem, then we propose a two-stage network to overcome it. We advocate the few-shot dataset of VQA, which has two subsets, namely the base set and novel set, and we generate the attributes of answers without human effort. Given a large amount of training data from the base dataset, we utilize BGN to model the relationship between words from the question and objects from the image and generate their joint embeddings in the base stage. Also, we get the representation of attributes with the designed attribute network and with the constraint between attributes and their source answers. With the assistant of well-trained vectors of attributes, we improve the representation of compositional answers that have only a few examples in the novel stage. Applying our approach to the validation set of VQA v2.0, our method has a better performance than the baseline method and other similar networks in the top-1 and top-5 accuracy. However, the result (15.46% on 10-shot in top-1 accuracy) is far from satisfactory compared with it on the base set (61.18% on BGN), and more research should be further investigated on this problem.</p>
