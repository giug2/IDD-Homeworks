<p id="id24.id1" class="ltx_p">Industry 4.0 has brought numerous advantages, such as increasing productivity through automation. However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) encompasses the convergence of physical systems and digital technologies to create smart, interconnected, collaborative, and autonomous industrial processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Key components of Industry 4.0 include the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data analytics, and cyber-physical systems. These technologies allow industries to optimize operations, enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable more efficient decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, as industries increasingly adopt digital technologies and interconnected systems, they become more susceptible to anomalies provoked by cyberattacks, misconfigurations, or failures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Cybercriminals target industrial systems to disrupt operations, steal sensitive data, cause financial losses, and even compromise workers’ safety. Common cyberattacks affecting industries include i) Ransomware, encrypting critical data or systems to demand a ransom; ii) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), disrupting industrial processes with a flood of traffic; iii) Insider Threats caused by employees performing malicious actions or stealing data; or iv) Supply Chain Attacks, targeting vulnerabilities in the supply chain to gain access to industrial systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has recently been proposed as a promising paradigm to detect most of the previous cyberattacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In the context of Industry 4.0, FL offers significant benefits in terms of collaboration and privacy preservation. More in detail, industrial organizations can collaborate on improving their cyberattack detection capabilities without sharing proprietary or sensitive data. Sensitive data remains on individual devices or industries while ML/DL model parameters are exchanged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical drawbacks of centralized FL (CFL) in Industry 4.0 that must be avoided. In this sense, Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> advances CFL by eliminating the need for a central server in the learning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advances of works proposing FL to detect cyberattacks in Industry 4.0, critical open challenges still need more effort <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. First, related work follows a CFL setup, where the central server is a single point of failure. Furthermore, the central server becomes a bottleneck during the aggregation process, especially as the number of devices increases. Second, as the literature identifies, analyzing time-series data is crucial for detecting anomalies caused by cyberattacks creating unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from the expected norms. However, there is no DFL-oriented work considering time series analysis to detect cyberattacks affecting Industry 4.0. Finally, there is no work evaluating the performance detection and resource consumption of DFL versus CFL setups using time series.</p>

TemporalFED consists of three components that are capable of processing time-series data. The first component is responsible for converting tabular data into time-series data. The second component is in charge of extracting new features by means of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and autocorrelation (AC). Finally, the last component is responsible for transforming non-stationary time-series data into a stationary one by means of removing trends and seasonality.</p>

The second type of experiment measured the resource consumption of the TemporalFED in terms of CPU and RAM usage and bytes exchanged by the federation participants.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With Industry 4.0 maturing into 5.0, the concept of DFL is becoming a pivotal element in handling the vast volumes of data produced and processed within industry domains. Martínez et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> comprehensively reviews the DFL landscape, addressing its fundamentals, applications, existing solutions, and associated challenges. In this work, the authors thoroughly explore DFL as a solution, underling its advantages in minimizing data sharing and avoiding centralized architecture dependencies. Their findings are instrumental in identifying the limitations of existing DFL solutions for industrial scenarios, forming the basis for creating novel functionalities suited for these contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Among the numerous practical applications of DFL, one area of interest is the implementation of decentralized FL systems in industrial wireless networks. Savazzi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> provide a real-time framework for analyzing DFL running on top of industrial networks rooted in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard. This research contributes to optimizing network and ML model deployment, with special attention to model pruning, sparsification, and quantization. While DFL effectively addresses a single point of failure, the limitations of communications resources in Device-to-Device (D2D) links present another challenge. Ma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduce a quantization-based DFL (Q-DFL) mechanism, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing data transmission volume and ensuring the convergence of DFL models. Moreover, they designed a consensus mechanism and synchronizing protocols to manage transitions between phases in the industrial field.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of Industry 4.0, cognitive computing introduces another layer of complexity to the automation process. Qu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose a decentralized paradigm merging FL and blockchain to resolve performance and security issues. This approach leverages the strength of blockchain-enabled FL, promoting quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. The advent of Industry 5.0 intensifies the issues related to centralization, privacy preservation, latency, and security in industrial infrastructures. Singh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> present FusionFedBlock, a fusion of blockchain and FL framework designed to uphold privacy in Industry 5.0. It demonstrates consistent performance using CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets, achieving a notable 93.5% accuracy in active nodes. Renathunga et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> present a similar solution using a hierarchical network of aggregators to evaluate the quality of local model updates, offering a flexible and efficient solution that outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, throughput, and latency.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Continuing this trend in industrial scenarios, Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> propose a DeceFL framework, which operates independently of a central client, relying solely on local transmissions. The proposed framework showcases its effectiveness in both convex and nonconvex loss functions, time-invariant and time-varying topologies, and IID and Non-IID datasets. Similarly, Qui et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> focus on the application of DFL in the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In an effort to counter the threat of data leakage and misuse by central servers, the authors propose a DFL algorithm based on deep neural networks. The algorithm employs an intrinsic plasticity method that addresses the problem of unreliable central servers in the peer-to-peer structure. In addition, it combines the decentralized medium consensus and the alternating direction algorithm of multipliers, which each agent solves with its own local data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From a wide perspective, Rodríguez et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and Nain et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> revised the most recent literature on anomaly detection and edge computing in industrial scenarios. Besides, Hiessl et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> revised the requirements and system designs for industrial FL applicability. These works highlight the importance of time series processing and FL in the state-of-the-art. However, they also remark on challenges related to the lack of processing tools for direct scenario evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> were among the first authors that proposed the usage of FL for anomaly detection in industrial time-series data. They used a convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that leverages attention mechanisms. Gradient compression was also applied to reduce 50% of the communication overhead introduced by the centralized FL aggregation mechanism. Four real-world datasets were employed for validation, demonstrating the good performance of the approach.</p>

Several datasets were employed for validation, improving literature results in most of them. Besides, they verified that the resource usage of the approach is suitable for Industrial IoT devices. Similarly, Truong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> also applied FL for anomaly detection for time-series data in ICS. In this case, the authors centered their solution on the lightweight perspective. To that end, they combine Fourier transform operation as preprocessing with Transformer Autoencoder models for anomaly detection. The advantage of these models against recurrent ones, such as LSTM, is their faster training due to the absence of recursion during training. This approach was also evaluated with several datasets of industrial scenarios, such as electricity, gas, and water supply control. Huu Du et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> also proposed FL and transformers applied to ICS, in this case, for remaining lifetime prediction. They were able to improve state-of-the-art by up to 25% using this attention-based mechanism.</p>

Two different models are combined, one looking for the normal functioning of the devices and another checking about threat identification. For validation, the SWaT and gas pipeline datasets were selected, achieving better performance than other solutions in the literature. Also, for intrusion detection, De Carvalho Bertoli et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a generalist unsupervised FL approach using stacked ensemble models.

A DL-based model is employed as an observer of the faults in order to identify the component generating them. The approach is validated using the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset. Moreover, Radaideh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> also applied time series and LSTM networks for anomaly detection in high-voltage converters.

From the list of works reviewed, some conclusions and open challenges can be extracted. First, it can be seen that industrial scenarios have not been extensively covered using DFL-based setups. Some works have introduced DFL in the industry, but still use rather simple datasets not based on real-world deployments. In contrast, FL and time series have been extensively applied in real-world industrial scenarios from a wide variety of perspectives, being the usage of attention-based mechanisms the trend nowadays. From these two takeaways, it arises the need for a platform capable of applying time-series analysis over DFL in industrial scenarios, making it possible to extrapolate traditional FL approaches to fully decentralized ones, which are the trend nowadays due to their advantages.</p>

It is crucial to consider this property to develop anomaly detectors that are efficient in detecting cyberattacks in industrial settings.

Specifically, the first component is designed to handle tabular data and convert it into a time-series format. The second component extracts new features that aid the anomaly detector in distinguishing between normal system behavior and behavior under attack. Finally, the third component is responsible for studying the trend and seasonality in the data and, if present, eliminating them to convert the time series into stationery.</p>

Specifically, the dominant values derived from the AC technique provide insights into the similarity between the current time-series signal and its future instances. On the other hand, the dominant values or frequencies extracted through the DFT technique represent the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in the signal. In the context of industrial scenarios, it is reasonable to assume that anomalies resulting from cyberattacks would alter these dominant values.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Removing trends and seasonality from time-series data is crucial for several reasons. On the one hand, trends refer to long-term changes in the data, which can hide the underlying patterns and make it difficult to discern the true relationships within the data. By removing trends, the resultant model can focus on the inherent fluctuations and patterns of interest for analysis, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the underlying dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, seasonality refers to repetitive patterns that occur within specific time intervals, such as daily, weekly, or yearly cycles. These patterns can introduce significant variability and distort the statistical properties of the data. Eliminating seasonality can reduce the impact of these repetitive patterns and obtain a clearer picture of the underlying dynamics that are not influenced by specific time intervals. This is particularly important for making reliable forecasts, as failing to account for seasonality can lead to inaccurate predictions and misleading conclusions.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Achieving stationarity by eliminating trends and seasonality in a time series is vital for applying various statistical models and analysis techniques. It ensures that the statistical properties of the series, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time, allowing for more robust and accurate analysis. By obtaining a stationary time series, researchers can make informed decisions, develop reliable models, and draw valid conclusions based on the data, leading to advancements in scientific understanding and practical applications in various fields.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes to use simple and efficient techniques to detrend and convert time series generated in industrial environments into stationary ones. To do this, this component first checks if the input time-series data is stationary. For this, the component uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), a statistical test used to determine whether a time series is stationary or non-stationary. It compares the coefficient of the lagged differenced variable in an autoregressive model against critical values. If the test statistic is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is rejected, indicating stationarity. On the other hand, if the test statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is not rejected, suggesting non-stationarity. The ADF test accounts for serial correlation and higher-order autoregressive processes, making it a reliable method to assess stationarity in time-series data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">If the ADF test returns that the time series is stationary, this component does no additional work. Otherwise, the component proceeds to eliminate the trend and seasonality. First, the component uses a simple but runtime-efficient technique to remove the trend. In particular, it is proposed to use the difference between the time series and the moving average of the time series. With this simple operation, the trend is eliminated from the time series. Second, to eliminate the seasonality of the time series, the component uses the differentiation technique, which is another simple and efficient technique in terms of execution. This technique calculates the difference between the current value and its value in the previous season. However, to apply this technique correctly, it is necessary to know the repetition period of the season. Simple patterns can be identified by plotting the data. However, this is not scalable, automatic, or works in cases where the patterns are more complex. Therefore, the component uses AC to determine such parameters. Once the component knows the frequency with which the season is repeated, the differentiation technique can be applied to eliminate the seasonality. However, because the problem faced is anomaly detection, this component only examines and eliminates the season and trend in the normal data. The reason is that a cyberattack can produce such patterns, and if the component eliminates them from abnormal data, it loses a huge amount of information.</p>

This leads to vapor products and unreacted components forming, which then flow into the condenser. In the condenser, these products and unreacted components undergo cooling and transition from gaseous to liquid states. The resulting mixture is then directed to a separator that separates the unreacted components, which are subsequently recycled and reintroduced into the process through the compressor. On the contrary, the condensed products are directed to a product stripping module, where any remaining reactants are removed.

The authors released four files: training files and test files containing anomalies, as well as training files and test files without any anomalies. Each file consists of 500 simulations for each type of anomaly. In the training files, each simulation contains 500 samples, while the test files comprise 960 samples. These files encompass 52 features, consisting of 41 measurement variables and 11 manipulated variables sampled every 3 minutes.

The training set included the initial 60 simulations, comprising a total of 480 samples from the training files. The first 20 samples were excluded since they were mislabeled as normal in the anomaly simulations. The validation set consisted of the subsequent 30 simulations from the training files, each containing 480 samples. Similarly, the first 20 samples were removed for each simulation. Finally, the test set comprised the first 30 simulations from the test files. The initial 160 samples were discarded as they were labeled as normal for the anomaly simulations. Therefore, for each simulation, samples ranging from 161 to 500 were selected, resulting in a total of 340 samples. Furthermore, the datasets were normalized using a standard scaler that calculates the mean and standard deviation of the training set and utilizes them to normalize the evaluation and test sets. Subsequently, the samples referring to anomalies 3, 9, and 15 were eliminated since they did not suffer enough variation to be considered anomalies, as pointed out by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the DL model used in Fedstellar during the experiments, it was an LSTM network. Specifically, it was a two-layer LSTM network consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The first hidden layer has 128 neurons, while the second has 64 neurons. The output layer was a dense network with 21 neurons. The chosen activation function for the hidden layers was ReLU, and for the output layer, Softmax was employed. As a result, the output provides the probability for each of the considered classes. Finally, the batch size was set to 1024, and both rounds and epochs were fixed to 10.

Specifically, it was considered the fully connected, ring, and star topologies. Regarding the paradigms of FL, it was considered DFL, SDFL, and CFL. In this context, DFL and SDFL were tested with the fully connected and ring topologies, while CFL, by design, used star topology. The method employed by Fedstellar to aggregate the weights of the model was FedAvg, a popular technique that consists in performing the average of the weights of all participants in the federation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

During these experiments, the TemporalFED was configured in different ways. The first configuration enabled only the component that transforms the tabular data into time series. This component is also enabled in the subsequent configuration since it is mandatory to process time-series data. The second configuration activated all three components of the TemporalFED. The third configuration activated the feature engineering component. Finally, the fourth configuration enabled the stationary conversion component. Considering these four configurations, the three different topologies (fully connected, star, and ring), and the three considered paradigms (DFL, SDFL, and CFL), a total of 20 experiments have been performed.</p>

An interesting result is that the CFL paradigm yields the poorest results for any configuration of the TemporalFED module. Specifically, the maximum F1-score achieved within these configurations is 0.9082, while the minimum is 0.8762. Despite exhibiting the worst performance, CFL can still be considered suitable for industrial environments where the patterns in transported data can be exceedingly complex. However, this reinforces the utility of employing a distributed approach (DFL and SDFL) for anomaly detection in industrial settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding optimal precision performance, the DFL paradigm with a fully connected topology and solely activating the time-series conversion component achieved the highest score with 0.9509. Regarding the recall, the approach utilizing the SDFL paradigm, a fully connected topology, and only the time-series conversion component attained the best performance (0.9370). Furthermore, this same approach also achieved the highest F1-score (0.9406), thus exhibiting superior overall performance in anomaly detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the other configurations of the TemporalFED module, it is evident that the use of feature engineering component based on DFT and AC slightly degrades performance for all tested topologies and paradigms. Additionally, utilizing all components of the TemporalFED module also resulted in slightly lower performance due to the activation of the feature engineering component using DFT and AC.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In connection with the configuration using the stationary conversion component, promising results were observed, outperforming other paradigms and topologies in certain cases. For instance, when employing DFL with a ring topology, this approach achieved a precision score of 0.9460, surpassing the configuration using only the conversion to time series (0.9414). This same pattern was also observed for recall and F1-score metrics for the aforementioned configurations, with the DFL, ring, and stationary conversion component attaining a recall of 0.9324 and an F1-score of 0.9364. In contrast, the DFL, ring, and time-series conversion achieved a recall of 0.9266 and an F1-score of 0.9306.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, the results indicate that the distributed approaches, particularly utilizing the DFL and SDFL paradigms, improve performance in detecting anomalies in complex industrial environments.

Clearly, the configuration of the TemporalFED utilizing feature extraction through DFT and AC (green and yellow lines) involves the most information exchange among participants since the number of features and weights being exchanged is higher than in other configurations. Notably, the number of exchanged bytes is particularly significant in the CFL paradigm compared to other scenarios.

This consumption pattern mirrors what was observed in the CPU usage. Specifically, configurations utilizing the feature extraction component (yellow and green lines) exhibited higher levels of RAM usage.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes TemporalFED, a software module for DFL platforms that analyzes time-series data to detect cyberattacks affecting industrial scenarios. TemporalFED comprises three components: the first converts tabular data into time-series data, suitable for Deep Learning algorithms; the second extracts features using DFT and autocorrelation techniques, while the third component converts time series into stationary form to facilitate processing. TemporalFED has been deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL platform enabling decentralized training of FL models under different configurations of clients, topologies, and algorithms. TemporalFED has been validated in a simulated yet realistic industrial testbed that gathers data from chemical industrial processes. The performance in terms of anomaly detection and resource consumption (bandwidth, %CPU, and %RAM) was evaluated in a pool of 20 experiments with different configurations in terms of FL paradigms (DFL, SDFL, and CFL), topologies (fully connected, ring, and star), and time series (solely time-series conversion, feature engineering alone, stationary conversion alone, and all three components combined). The results demonstrated that DFL and SDFL paradigms, in conjunction with the fully connected topology, achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Particularly, the DFL combined with fully connected achieved 0.9509, 0.9369, and 0.9405 in precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, while the SDFL and fully connected combination obtained 0.9507, 0.9370, and 0.9406 in precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively. Regarding resource consumption, the CFL paradigm exchanged the highest number of bytes with federation participants. CPU usage remained consistent at 80% for all configurations, while RAM usage varied between 10% and 35% depending on the paradigm, topology, and configuration of the TemporalFED. In conclusion, the configuration using the feature engineering component consumed the highest amount of resources.</p>
