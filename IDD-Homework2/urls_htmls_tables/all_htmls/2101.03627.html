<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies a federated learning (FL) system, where <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple</span> FL services co-exist in a wireless network and share common wireless resources. It fills the void of wireless resource allocation for multiple simultaneous FL services in the existing literature. Our method designs a two-level resource allocation framework comprising <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">intra-service</em> resource allocation and <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">inter-service</em> resource allocation. The intra-service resource allocation problem aims to minimize the length of FL rounds by optimizing the bandwidth allocation among the clients of each FL service. Based on this, an inter-service resource allocation problem is further considered, which distributes bandwidth resources among multiple simultaneous FL services. We consider both cooperative and selfish providers of the FL services. For cooperative FL service providers, we design a distributed bandwidth allocation algorithm to optimize the overall performance of multiple FL services, meanwhile cater to the fairness among FL services and the privacy of clients. For selfish FL service providers, a new auction scheme is designed with the FL service owners as the bidders and the network provider as the auctioneer. The designed auction scheme strikes a balance between the overall FL performance and fairness. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform other benchmarks under various network conditions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Today’s mobile devices are generating an unprecedented amount of data every day. Leveraging the recent success of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), this rich data has the potential to power a wide range of new functionalities and services, such as learning the activities of smart phone users, predicting health events from wearable devices or adapting to pedestrian behavior in autonomous vehicles. With the help of multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers, ML models can be quickly trained/updated using this data to adapt to the changing environment without moving the data to the remote cloud data center, which is envisioned in intelligent next-generation communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, due to the growing storage and computational power of mobile devices as well as privacy concerns associated with uploading personal data, it is increasingly attractive to store and process data directly on mobile devices. Federate learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is thus proposed as a new distributed ML framework, where mobile devices collaboratively train a shared ML model with the coordination of an edge server while keeping all the training data on device, thereby decoupling the ability to do ML from the need to upload/store the data to/in a public entity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A typical FL service involves a number of mobile devices (a.k.a., participating clients) and an edge server (a.k.a., a parameter server) to train a ML model, which lasts for a number of learning rounds. In each round, the clients download the current ML model from the server, improve it by learning from their local data, and then upload the individual model updates to the server; the server then aggregates the local updates to improve the shared model. For example, the seminal work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proposed the FedAvg algorithm in which the global model is obtained by averaging the parameters of local models. Although other FL algorithms differ in the specifics, the majority of them follow the same procedure. Because the clients work in the same wireless network to download and upload models, how to allocate the limited wireless bandwidth among the participating clients has a crucial impact on the resulting FL speed and efficiency. Therefore, resource allocation for wireless FL systems is attracting much attention recently in the wireless communications community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Compared to resource allocation in traditional throughput-maximizing wireless networks, the resource allocation objective and outcome become considerably different for wireless FL due to its unique requirements and characteristics.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although existing works have made meaningful progress towards efficient resource allocation for wireless FL, they share the common limitation that only a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">single</span> FL service was considered. As ML-powered applications grow and become more diverse, it is anticipated that the wireless network will host <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple</span> co-existing FL services, the set of which may also dynamically change over time. See Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Bandwidth Allocation for Multiple Federated Learning Services in Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for an illustration of the multi-FL service scenario. The presence of multiple FL services makes resource allocation for wireless FL much more challenging. <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">First</span>, the achievable FL performance depends on not only <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">intra-service</span> resource allocation among the participating clients within each FL service but also <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inter-service</span> resource allocation among different FL services, and these two levels of allocation decisions are also strongly coupled. <span id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Second</span>, the FL service providers may adopt different FL algorithms and choose different configurations (e.g., number of participating clients, number of epochs of local training, etc.), yet this information is not always available to the wireless network operator due to privacy concerns when making resource allocation decisions. <span id="S1.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Third</span>, because FL service providers have their individual goals, they may have incentives to untruthfully reveal their valuation of the wireless bandwidth if by doing so they gain advantages in the inter-service bandwidth allocation. Without the correct information, there is no guarantee on the overall system performance. <span id="S1.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Finally</span>, as in any multi-user system, resource allocation should strike a good balance between efficiency and fairness – every FL service provider should obtain a reasonable share of the wireless resource to train their ML models using FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we make an initial effort to study wireless FL with multiple co-existing FL services, which share the same bandwidth to train their respective ML models. Our focus is on the efficient bandwidth allocation among different FL services as well as among the participating clients within each FL service, thereby understanding the interplay between these two levels of allocation decisions. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We formalize a two-level bandwidth allocation problem for multiple FL services co-existing in the wireless network, which may start and complete at different time depending on their own demand and FL requirements. The model is general enough for any FL algorithm that involves downloading, local learning, uploading and global aggregation in each learning round, and hence has wide applicability in real-world systems. In addition, we explicitly take fairness into consideration when optimizing bandwidth allocation to ensure that no FL service is starved of bandwidth.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider two use cases depending on the nature/goals of the FL service providers. In the first case, FL service providers are fully cooperative to maximize the overall system performance. For this, we design a distributed optimization algorithm based on dual decomposition to solve the two-level bandwidth allocation problem. The algorithm keeps all FL-related information at the individual FL service provider side without sharing it with the network operator, thereby reducing the communication overhead and enhancing privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A lot of research has been devoted to tackling various challenges of FL, including but not limited to developing new optimization and model aggregation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, handling non-i.i.d. and unbalanced datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, dealing with the straggler problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, preserving model and data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and ensuring fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. A comprehensive review of these challenges can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In particular, the communication aspect of FL has been recognized as a primary bottleneck due to the tension between uploading a large amount of model data for aggregation and the limited network resource to support this transmission, especially in a wireless environment. In this regard, early research on communication-efficient FL largely focuses on reducing the amount of transmitted data while assuming that the underlying communication channel has been established, e.g., updating clients with significant training improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, compressing the gradient vectors via quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, or accelerating training using sparse or structured updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. More recent research starts to address this problem from a more communication system perspective, e.g., using a hierarchical FL network architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> that allows partial model aggregation, and leveraging the wireless transmission property to perform analog model aggregation over the air <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As wireless networks are envisioned as a main deployment scenario of FL, wireless resource allocation for FL is another active research topic. Many existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> study the trade-off between local model update and global model aggregation. Client selection is essential to enable FL at scale and address the straggler problem. Different types of joint bandwidth allocation and client scheduling policies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> have been proposed to either minimize the training loss or the training time. In all these works, resource allocation is carried out among clients of a <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">single</span> FL service, while assuming that the FL service itself has already received dedicated resource. In stark contrast, our paper studies a network consisting of multiple co-existing FL services and performs resource allocation at both the FL service level and the client level. We notice that a related problem where multiple FL services are being trained at the same time is also considered in a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In that paper, different FL services run on the same set of clients and a joint computation and communication resource scheduling problem is studied. In our paper, different FL services have their separate client sets which may experience very different channel qualities and hence we focus only on the bandwidth allocation problem. Moreover, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> assumed that all clients are obedient, we study the possible selfish nature of FL service providers and highlight bandwidth allocation fairness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering each FL service as a “user”, our problem is a special type of resource allocation problems for multi-user wireless networks. While many concepts and techniques adopted in this paper, including proportional fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, dual decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and multi-bid auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, have seen applications in other multi-user wireless resource allocation domains, applying them in multi-service FL requires special treatment as two levels of resource allocation are involved in our problem.
In particular, there is no closed-form expression of how the performance (i.e., learning speed) of a FL service depends on the resource allocation among its clients. Therefore, understanding the inter-dependency of intra-service and inter-service bandwidth allocation is essential. Furthermore, we put an emphasis on the resource fairness among different FL services by designing a new fairness-adjusted multi-bid auction mechanism in the selfish FL service provider case, thereby achieving a tunable tradeoff between efficiency and fairness. We point out that there are some existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> on designing incentive mechanisms for client participation of a single FL service. These works are very different from our paper in terms of both the problem and the approaches, and do not consider fairness when designing the mechanism.</p>

A FL service finishes and hence exits the wireless network when a certain termination criteria is satisfied (e.g., the training loss is below a threshold, the testing accuracy is above a threshold, or other convergence criterion), which usually varies across FL services and are pre-specified by the corresponding service provider. Therefore, a FL service may span multiple periods. The wall clock time (i.e. the number of periods) that a FL service takes to finish depends on the difficulty and other inherent characteristics of the service itself as well as how much wireless resource is allocated to this service in each period for which it stays and how this bandwidth is further allocated among its participating clients. In what follows, we first formulate the client-level (i.e., intra-service) bandwidth allocation problem and then describe the service-level (i.e., inter-service) bandwidth allocation problem.</p>

In the first scenario, all FL service providers are <span id="S3.SS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cooperative</span>, and their goal is to maximize the FL performance of the overall system. Therefore, it is equivalent to the network operator solving a system-wide optimization problem. In the second scenario, the FL service providers are <span id="S3.SS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">selfish</span> who care about only their own FL performance. As these service providers are competing for the limited bandwidth resource, addressing their incentive issues is crucial. In this paper, we design a fairness-adjusted multi-bid auction mechanism for the inter-service bandwidth allocation in this case. In the following two sections, we discuss these two scenarios separately.</p>

In this paper, we design and incorporate a fairness-adjusted charging scheme into the above pricing scheme.

To this end, the client number of a FL service is drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 25 and we change the variance between 0 and 15 to adjust the heterogeneity degree.

This is understandable because a higher degree of heterogeneity causes wireless bandwidth to be more unevenly distributed among the FL services, thereby degrading the overall FL performance. Notably, the performance gain of our proposed algorithms increases as the variance increases, which demonstrates the superior ability of our algorithms to handle the heterogeneous case.</p>

In these simulations, the average channel condition of a FL service is drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 85 and we change the variance between 0 and 15 to adjust the heterogeneity degree. The channel conditions of clients of this FL are further drawn from a Normal distribution with a mean being the instantiated average channel condition.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studied a bandwidth allocation problem for multiple FL services in a wireless network, which has not been well studied in the literature. The considered problem consists of two interconnected subproblems, intra-service resource allocation, and inter-service resource allocation. By solving these problems, we optimally allocate bandwidth resources to multiple FL services and their corresponding clients to speed up the training process and meanwhile guarantee fairness for both cooperative and selfish FL service providers cases. Our method has shown superior performance compared to the benchmarks. However, there are several future research works that can be done to extend the impact of this work. For example, this paper takes FL frequency as the key metric to be optimized, but the true performance of FL is affected by the dataset, federated optimization algorithm, and many others. In addition, when a client can simultaneously participate in multiple FL services, resource allocation has to consider both the wireless bandwidth and client computing resources.</p>
