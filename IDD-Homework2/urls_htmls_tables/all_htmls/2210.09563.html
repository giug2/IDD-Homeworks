<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the continuous development of deep learning in the field of image generation models, a large number of vivid forged faces have been generated and spread on the Internet.
These high-authenticity artifacts could grow into a threat to society security.
Existing face forgery detection methods directly utilize the obtained public shared or centralized data for training but ignore the personal privacy and security issues when personal data couldn’t be centralizedly shared in real-world scenarios.
Additionally, different distributions caused by diverse artifact types would further bring adverse influences on the forgery detection task.
To solve the mentioned problems, the paper proposes a novel generalized residual <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated learning for face <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Forgery</span> detection (<span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedForgery</span>).
The designed variational autoencoder aims to learn robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect forgery faces (with diverse or even unknown artifact types).
Furthermore, the general federated learning strategy is introduced to construct distributed detection model trained collaboratively with multiple local decentralized devices, which could further boost the representation generalization.
Experiments conducted on publicly available face forgery detection datasets prove the superior performance of the proposed FedForgery.
The designed novel generalized face forgery detection protocols and source code would be publicly available at <em id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">https://github.com/GANG370/FedForgery.</em></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the large development of deep generative models, face forgery technology has been spread widely and rapidly. Consequently, the artifact forgery clue has become more and more difficult to identify, even undistinguishable to human eyes. Meanwhile, the forgery technology may be abused by criminals, by changing the faces of public stars and politicians’ videos, thereby spreading some negative public information; attacking the face identification system in the transportation hub, impersonating target identities for pursuit-evasion, etc.
There is no doubt that these dangerous behaviors are very likely to bring about unpredictable effects on social security.
Although a lot of researchers have been focused on face forgery detection tasks, these artifact videos contain large amounts of redundant data, complex backgrounds, and diverse artifact types, which would inevitably bring negative effects on forgery detection tasks. Thus, face forgery detection is still a challenging and important problem in real-world scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Face forgery detection can be easily defined as a binary classification problem.
Existing forgery detection methods can be roughly divided into two categories: forgery image detection methods and forgery video detection methods.
The forgery image detection methods mainly focus on the difference between the real and the fake images in the low-level information, such as utilizing the image frequency domain information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the image mixed boundary information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and the extra head pose features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, etc. Different from forgery image detection, forgery video detection methods mainly perform authenticity detection based on the visually unnatural image cross-frame transition and temporal inconsistency of fake videos.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> utilized a multi-instance learning framework to capture the temporal inconsistency of faces for deep fakes detection. Sabir et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed the convolution recursive model to extract the temporal information of the video stream to detect the authenticity of the video.
It is noted that existing detection methods usually required centralized training data for training model parameters, which makes it easy to leak personal privacy.
How to effectively train models with distributed training data on different devices and protect personal privacy draws more and more attention in recent years.
In addition, different forgery distributions caused by diverse artifact types would further bring adverse influences.
<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">To mimic the real-world scenarios, we newly design two novel face forgery detection tasks: Hybrid-dataset forgery detection and Generalized-dataset forgery detection task as shown in Figure 1.

The same artifact type forgery dataset is selected in both the training and testing stages.
The middle subfigure shows the designed Hybrid-dataset forgery detection task, where multiple artifact types are mixed as the training data and the evaluation model aims to distinguish the authenticity of input faces.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning has been developed rapidly and widely deployed in the real world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
In the federated learning architecture, each local client could only use local private data for training the local model firstly, and then upload the model parameters to the global server for training the global model.
After aggregating the model parameters several times, the server model parameters will be sent to each data center for updating. The aggregation update process will be iterative until the training loss converges.
The federated learning strategy inspires us to design a suitable training method to protect local data privacy, and further learn robust forgery discriminative features with strong generalization ability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel generalized residual Federated learning for face Forgery detection (FedForgery), which not only could train a global model collaboratively for security restrictions but also would improve the discriminative forgery representation generalization ability.
Firstly, considering diverse artifact distribution in the generalized forgery detection tasks, we design the variational autoencoder model to learn robust residual feature maps for forgery clues.
Secondly, the proposed residual federated learning algorithm is introduced to update distributed local model parameters and global server model parameters collaboratively, which could further boost the forgery representation generalization ability.
Finally, the global model in the server could directly detect different artifact types and even unknown type forgery.
<em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The main reason for superior performance is that we effectively propose the residual feature map for generalized forgery detection, and simultaneously introduce a specific federated learning strategy to boost performance and protect data privacy.</em></p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, with the increasing popularity of face forgery technology, research on face forgery detection has gradually developed.
Face forgery detection is essentially a binary classification problem, the purpose of it is to train a classifier with a high degree of precision and generalizability.
As far as the currently proposed methods are concerned, they can be divided into image-based face forgery detection methods and video-based face forgery detection methods.</p>

The limitation of this method is that the person in the video must be in a state of open eyes.
The new spatiotemporal convolution method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> is proposed to detect artifact traces across video frames for video authenticity identification. Video-based detection methods are always computationally expensive compared with image-based methods, because of fusing temporal inconsistencies.
Overall, most image-based forgery detection and video-based forgery detection methods both ignore the issue of data privacy.
They always utilized shared or centralized images when training the model, which increases the risk of data leakage.
In addition, limited research has explored the distributed storage of training data in the forgery detection field.</p>

Due to the diverse forgery artifact types, these existing domain gaps even may be larger than the difference between real and fake images. It makes it still a challenging problem to distinguish the authenticity in unknown artifact scenarios. Thus, we assume that exploring the specific characteristics of reconstruction residual is easier than inputting raw images in the multiple domain forgery scenarios. It also inspires us to design suitable robust residual features learning to avoid overfitting and effectively capture domain-invariant discrepancy information between real and fake images.
As shown in Figure 2, each data center aims to train a local face forgery detection model first.
We design a variational autoencoder to analyze the difference between real images and artifact reconstruction residuals under different artifact types.
The local client model consists of two networks: RecNet represents the face reconstruction network, and ClsNet represents the forgery classification network.

Each data center uses its own data to train the model locally, and the local model further analyzes the difference between real image and artifact reconstruction residuals under different artifact types through a variational autoencoder. After a round of local training is completed, each data center uploads the obtained model parameters to the global server for weighted aggregation. After the aggregation is completed, the global server sends the updated parameters to each data center. This communication process continues until the model converges and is eventually tested using the updated aggregated global server model.</figcaption>

sg[·] stands for stop gradient.
The stop gradient operator on the encoder output indicates that the term is only used to update the embedding vector, which is conducive to better learning the embedding space.
The latter term aims to force the encoder output to commit as much as possible to its closest embedding vector.
The stop gradient on the embedding vector helps to limit the volume of the discrete embedding space and prevent its free growth.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.25" class="ltx_p">To further improve the representation discriminability to detect different forgery artifact patterns, we design the residual federated learning strategy. The designed global model not only updates parameters through training decentralized data collaboratively to protect privacy, but also aggregates the captured discrepancy information in several local models in a federated learning strategy.
As shown in Figure 2, the residual federated learning framework is designed for the distributed forgery detection models deployment, which aims to mimic real-world scenarios.

As shown in Table I, we reimplemented several representative face forgery methods on the Hybrid-domain forgery dataset.
CNNDetection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> aims to design a simple convolutional neural network to detect forgery clues.
Related works<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> found that CNN detectors are prone to overfitting the texture patterns of specific generation methods.
Thus, two different data augmentation methods were designed to boost performance.
KNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> uses the frequency domain information of pictures to detect forgery. This method may be misled by some noise signals, especially when encountering complex datasets, and its detection performance will be greatly affected.
RECCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> enables the classifier to learn a more general representation by learning from real images, but its defect is that it cannot protect the privacy of training data in the face forgery detection task.
GFFD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> utilized high-frequency noise and the correlation between complementary modalities to facilitate feature learning. RFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> explored sensitive local regions and specific data augmentation strategies to boost performance. DCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> designed the inter-instance contrastive learning and local content inconsistencies to detect clues.
But the defect is that it cannot protect the privacy of training data in the face forgery detection task.</p>

For a fair comparison, we add the proposed methods with the centralized training strategy, denoted as FedForgery* in the following experiments.
As shown in Table I, benefiting from the designed generalized contractive feature learning, DCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> achieves the best AUC performance.

To further verify the generalization of the proposed FedForgery, we conduct new experiments on the Generalized forgery dataset.
The aim is to distinguish the authenticity of input faces even with unknown artifact types.
Similarly, we reimplement representative face forgery detection methods for fair comparisons.
The experimental results are shown in Table II.
For convenience, we set the testing set only contains one artifact type, and the training set contains the rest four types.
For example, when the testing set is chosen from DeepFakes dataset, the training set contains artifact types from WildDeepfake, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures datasets.</p>

The proposed FedForgery not only considers the privacy issue through distributed training, but also achieves accuracy at 99.75%, which is already close to the ultimate accuracy. Thus, the first protocol is not a reasonable experimental setting to distinguish the pros and cons of these comparison methods.
To further evaluate the generalization ability, we utilized the dataset perturbations to mimic real-world scenarios. When the training set is the standard set and the testing set is with single-level distortions (std/sing), the proposed FedForgery can achieve the SOTA accuracy and even exceed Resnet+LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> by 4.58%, XceptionNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> by 6.83% and I3D<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> by 4.46%.

For the convenience of analysis, we sampled 10% images from the WildDeepfake Dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> in the following experiments.
We set eight diverse data centers as local clients, and allocate the same number of datasets to each data center. The eight data centers would evaluate forgery detection performance after the local client training.
And the global server could evaluate performance after each round of global communication.
As shown in Figure 5, the pink line indicates the detection performance of the global server model, and the blue line indicates the average detection accuracies of eight data centers.
Here we find the performance of the global server is significantly higher than the results of data centers in local clients.
The forgery accuracy improves from about 1.34% to 6.35% after applying the proposed residual federated learning strategy.
The curve clearly proves that the proposed FedForgery can improve the forgery detection performance by aggregating the model parameters, and meanwhile protect the privacy of training data in local data centers.
Within a certain number of communication times, with the increase in global communication times, the detection performance of the proposed FedFogery is also improved.
When the global communication times reached about ten times, the forgery detection performance of the global server reaches the best point, with an accuracy rate of 79.21%. It proves the proposed residual federated learning strategy could help the forgery detection model not only train weights collaboratively for data security, but also would maintain strong performance in forgery detection tasks.</p>

It is because exploring the specific characteristics of reconstruction residual is easier than inputting raw images in the multiple domain forgery scenarios.

Existing traditional forgery detection methods generally directly input the raw image into an end-to-end network for binary classification. However, when processing data from complex unknown artifact patterns, the forgery detection performance is not encouraging. Different from direct feeding raw images into the network, we utilized a variational autoencoder framework to reconstruct the image and extract the residual feature to explore forgery clues.
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed residual learning strategy, we utilize the t-SNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> to visualize the feature distribution when inputting original images and residual images separately in the data center.

It can be observed that the feature distribution of the fake images represented by the green part (in the left subfigure of Figure 6) is scattered and overlap with the red part.
It is because the classifier has a poorer ability to discriminate the forged type when inputting original images.
As shown in the right subfigure of Figure 6, the feature distribution of fake images represented by the green part is more concentrated, indicating that fake images are embedded into a relatively compact feature space. This also demonstrates that our proposed method could capture more discriminative common representations for forgery detection.
Thus, the proposed residual learning strategy can effectively improve the generalization ability of forgery detection.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure 8, in order to analyze the visualization results of each data center and global server focusing on different regions, we utilized the gradient-based visualization tool to generate a Grad-CAM based attention map <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. It reveals the differences in the range of regions that data centers and the global server rely on for forgery detection.
As shown in subfigures (a)-(d), each data center and global server network focuses on the local facial semantic regions, which would be helpful for authenticity identification.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure 8 (a), the first eight columns represent the visualization effect when the data center model determines that the real face image is true. The attention map area of the real face has a small region range, while the last column shows that the data center model mistakenly classifies the real face with a different attention map.
<em id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">We find that when the forgery detection model makes the wrong decision, the attention map would not focus on suitable local face regions</em>;
In Figure 8 (b) the first eight columns represent the visualization results when the data center model identifies the input fake face image as false.
The attention map area of these inputs almost focuses on artifact regions (like mouth, eyes and nose).
However, the last column shows the attention map when the data center model mistakenly identifies the fake face as true.
It can be found that these attention maps don’t focus on the semantic regions, but instead on backgrounds;
In Figure 8 (c), the first eight columns represent the visualization results when the global server model identifies the real face image as true.
Similarly in Figure 8 (a), the proposed model mainly focuses on the local semantic regions.
For the wrong identification as shown in the last column, the results show the model pays much attention on redundant face regions but not local regions;
In Figure 8 (d), the first eight columns represent the visualization results when the global server model identifies the forged face image as fake.
Similarly in Figure 8 (b), the model also extracts discriminative forgery representation in local semantic artifact regions.
The wrong results as shown in the last column show the model is mistaken by the disturbance of complex backgrounds.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, these visualization results clearly prove our proposed FedFogery could extract discriminative forgery representation to focus on local semantic face regions to improve interpretability.
Additionally, it is interesting to find that the visualization attention map could help to directly identify the artifact regions to expand the forgery detection field in the future.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although data-driven forgery detection methods have achieved great progress in recent years, which benefit from the contraption of deep network architecture and large-scale labeled data. To further mimic real-world scenarios, more and more researchers focus on the generalization ability in face forgery detection tasks. Thus, we construct the novel hybrid-dataset and generalized-dataset forgery detection task to focus on detecting forgery clues in cross-domain even unknown artifact types. In this section, we discuss several unsolved problems and future potential directions to inspire researches in the community.</p>

However, more and more unknown artifact patterns would be created with the development of the deep generative model. And it is not impossible to label every artifact type accurately on the Internet. Thus, the key solution is to learn the general forgery clues to boost the forgery detection model performance. Unsupervised or weakly supervised learning(e.g. self-attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>, dynamic convolution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>) provides a possible solution to learn the essential discrepancy between real and fake images, which can strengthen the usability and scalability.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel generalized residual Federated learning method for face Forgery detection (FedForgery).
To improve the forgery detection generalization, we design a variational autoencoder to learn robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect forgery clues.
Additionally, the residual federated learning framework is introduced to train the forgery detection model collaboratively with multiple local data centers, which is essential to protect data privacy.
We conduct several experiments for face forgery detection tasks in complex real-world scenarios.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedForgery could effectively improve the ability of model generalization and privacy protection.
In the future, we will focus on exploring robust and interpretable face forgery detection methods to mimic more real-world scenarios.</p>
