<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning, a global model is learned by aggregating model updates computed at a set of independent client nodes, to reduce communication costs multiple gradient steps are performed at each node prior to aggregation. A key challenge in this setting is data heterogeneity across clients resulting in differing local objectives which can lead clients to overly minimize their own local objective, diverging from the global solution. We demonstrate that individual client models experience a catastrophic forgetting with respect to data from other clients and propose an efficient approach that modifies the cross-entropy objective on a per-client basis by re-weighting the softmax logits prior to computing the loss. This approach shields classes outside a client’s label set from abrupt representation change and we empirically demonstrate it can alleviate client forgetting and provide consistent improvements to standard federated learning algorithms. Our method is particularly beneficial under the most challenging federated learning settings where data heterogeneity is high and client participation in each round is low.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a shared global model is learned from a decentralized set of data located at a number of independent client nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Konečnỳ et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. Driven by communication constraints, FL algorithms typically perform a number of local gradient update steps before synchronizing with the global model. This reduced communication strategy is very effective under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) settings, but data heterogeneity across clients has direct implications on the convergence and performance of FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. FL was conceptualized as a learning technique to train a shared model without sharing user sensitive data, while allowing users to benefit from data stored at other nodes, such as phones and tablets of decentralized users. Under realistic settings, client data will often have non-i.i.d. distributions. For the case of supervised multi-class classification, users may frequently have no data whatsoever from one or several classes. Data in-homogeneity across clients frequently induces client drift, a phenomenon in which clients progress too far towards optimizing their own local objective, leading to a solution that has severely "drifted" from an optimal global solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In continual learning, a model is trained on a number of tasks sequentially and the learner needs to learn each new task without forgetting knowledge obtained from the preceding tasks. The tendency of a continual learning model to forget previously learned information when learning a new task is termed catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McCloskey &amp; Cohen, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite> and it is typically a focus of study in continual learning literature. Similar to FL, data heterogeneity in continual learning presents a challenge since different tasks typically contain data drawn from different underlying distributions.
We can draw a connection between the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning and the client drift problem in federated learning.
We consider one round of federated learning in which <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> random clients are selected and initialized with a copy of the current global model. Each client performs a pre-determined number of local update steps to optimize the objective on their local data. A round ends with an update to the global model achieved by aggregating the updates from each client. At the beginning of a round, the clients receive a model previously derived from training on other clients data. As local training proceeds, the model becomes increasingly biased towards a given client. As discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lesort (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Gupta et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, this can cause client models to rely on spurious correlations to improve their in-distribution performance, creating a situation where local models experience catastrophic forgetting with respect to data of the other clients (drawn from distinctly different distributions). Naturally, aggregating models that have deviated from a joint solution will lead to degraded results with respect to the global objective. We denote this problem as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local client forgetting</span>. Reducing local client forgetting would moderate the decrease in performance with respect to other clients data at individual client models. We hypothesize this would increase the ability of local models to generalize to the distribution of data from other clients and improve the loss of individual models over the combined data and we therefore propose to reduce client drift by tackling local client forgetting. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates local client forgetting within a round of federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are numerous approaches to tackle catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kirkpatrick et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Li &amp; Hoiem, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Chaudhry et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Schwarz et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Davari et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Many of these however are largely impractical in the FL setting. Experience Replay methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chaudhry et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> require access to other clients’ data, violating the fundamental data communication constraints of FL. Similar concerns exist for many regularization methods such as elastic weight consolidation (EWC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kirkpatrick et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> which require communicating additional information. Regularization methods can additionally require many steps to converge due to the additional conflicting objectives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Aljundi et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. This computational constraint can hurt convergence of the FL algorithm, a key desideratum. For the supervised continual learning setting, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Caccia et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Ahn et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed a modification of the standard cross entropy objective function that truncates the softmax denominator, removing terms corresponding to classes from old tasks. A variant of this method inspired by the long-tailed recognition methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ren et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> was also recently introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Jodelet et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. This simple approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting by reducing the bias on the model to avoid predicting old classes.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the parallels between client drift in FL and catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning case, we propose an adaptation of the CL method from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Caccia et al.

We will empirically demonstrate that this approach can drastically reduce client level forgetting in the heterogeneous setting, leading to substantially improved overall global model convergence and final performance. We apply the re-weighted softmax to baseline methods FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> demonstrating performance improvements in all cases.</p>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One significant challenge encountered when training on decentralized data is heterogeneity of samples across clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Konečnỳ et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Partitions contain data generated under different conditions, which can reasonably be expected to create different local distributions at each client. For the case of supervised multi-class classification, which is the focus of this work, users may frequently be missing data from an entire class or multiple classes of the global underlying distribution. During FL training, data at each client are sampled
from these local distributions, creating different local objectives. When clients progress too far towards minimizing their own objective, local models drift from one another, degrading the performance of the shared global model and slowing down convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yao et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Diao et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several attempts have been made to alleviate client drift through various methods. One approach centers around knowledge distillation to regulate local training, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> ensemble information about the global data distribution and disseminate it to clients via additional models trained at the server. These methods possess the added risk of privacy attacks and while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> take steps to mitigate this risk, their method requires the existence of an unlabeled dataset, which may not be available in all settings. Other approaches attempt to constrain gradient updates from the clients to reduce the impact of client drift. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Karimireddy et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> propose SCAFFOLD, an algorithm to control client drift using control norms to modify client gradients. The control norms estimate the drift at each client and use that estimate to correct the local updates. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> adds a proximal term to the local objective to limit the impact of variation in local updates. This term is weighted with an additional hyperparameter, <math id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.m1.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> which must be tuned appropriately. Both SCAFFOLD and FedProx require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Like SCAFFOLD and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Acar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> also estimate client drift and use it as a means to constrain updates. However, their operations take place at the server level and corrections are applied to the server updates thus avoiding SCAFFOLD’s use control norms and saving on the inherent communication burden. The general strategy for each of these methods is similar. They attempt to estimate client drift using gradient updates and then constrain the updates to reduce the drift. SCAFFOLD has additionally been shown to have unstable accuracy and has twice the communication burden of FedAvg due to the control norms required for each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Our proposed method modifies the objective functions locally, creating no additional communication burdens and introducing no additional hyperparameters. It also directly tackles the problem of the underlying distribution shift, unlike the other methods mentioned which attempt to address client heterogeneity through constrained gradient optimization and/or knowledge distillation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tenison et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> propose a gradient masking technique that modifies the aggregation of updates on the server side. This method does directly tackle the problem of distribution shift and while it has been shown to be effective at achieving better generalization on non i.i.d. data, our re-weighted softmax is able to take advantage of the structure of the commonly used cross-entropy loss, making it simpler to implement. Additionally, since we modify the objective functions locally, the re-weighted softmax method is compatible with any federated optimization method in the literature.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continual learning is a process by which tasks are learned sequentially over a period of time and knowledge of previous tasks is retained and leveraged to learn new tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen &amp; Liu, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Continual learning is made difficult by the fact that neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, in which learning a new task overrides weights learned from past training, thus degrading model performance on previously learned tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McCloskey &amp; Cohen, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite>. Several families of methods have been developed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The first class of methods are architecture based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Schwarz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> that attempt to grow or modify an architecture over time to expand its knowledge. In the second class of methods approaches which store some subset of old data for rehearsal are applied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lopez-Paz &amp; Ranzato, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Chaudhry et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Rebuffi et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Finally, a third class of methods regularizes the learned parameters to limit drastic weight changes when learning a new task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kirkpatrick et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Zenke et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. None of these solutions are widely applicable in a FL setting since they typically require some sort of information sharing across client nodes which is prohibited in the FL framework. A federated continual learning setting has been considered in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yoon et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Here each client in the federated network continuously collects data. Our work on the other hand considers the standard FL setting where each client maintains a fixed set of data and draws connections to a notion of forgetting across clients to motivate a modification of the loss function. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Shoham et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> have used ideas from continual learning to propose FedCurv, based on the EWC algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kirkpatrick et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> from continual learning. FedCurv requires sending additional information and is not compatible with all FL methods. Along this line, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Xu et al.

This is because the contrast term encourages classes not present on the client to never be predicted. The re-weighted softmax approach modifies the original local objective function to avoid excessive pressure that drives up the loss of other client data. Indeed, classes not present at the current client are ignored by the local optimization which forces the client to learn by adapting the model’s internal representation of the classes present in its training data, rather than abruptly shifting representations of classes outside its training set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caccia et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. We will demonstrate empirically this leads to a reduction in local client forgetting defined below.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When using WSM, we observe no preference for better accuracy along the diagonal as is the case without using WSM. In fact, we notice lower accuracies to be concentrated along the column, indicating a particularly difficult dataset for all local models or along the row, indicating a model that does badly on all datasets including its own. These observations are supported by the forgetting heatmap for WSM which is predominantly yellow indicating very low forgetting values.
These results show WSM has the ability to greatly limit the effects of local client forgetting by ignoring classes outside of its data distribution and focusing learning on the classes present. This narrower focus leads to better overall performance after aggregation. The heatmaps are shown for round 1200 of training, approximately a third of the way through training, however, the observation is further confirmed for other rounds as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Forgetting During a Federated Round ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> where we plot forgetting throughout training. We observe on average it is high in FedAVG and is substantially reduced especially at the end of training for WSM.

We observe that even combined with FL optimization based methods designed to address heterogeneity, WSM provides consistent performance gains. Furthermore, the best performance overall is highlighted in red. We find that although SCAFFOLD and FedPROX can handle heterogeneity better than FedAvg, when combined with WSM FedAvg can obtain the best performance amongst all methods.</figcaption>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">So far we have demonstrated the ability of WSM to improve model preformance for the FedAvg algorithm, now we demonstrate its effectiveness over a range of FL algorithms. In Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of WSM ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> we apply WSM to SCAFFOLD, Fed Nova and FedProx. SCAFFOLD and FedProx are constrained optimization based methods, specifically designed to address the problem of data heterogeneity and Fed Nova as well is designed to improve performance on heterogeneous data.
In these experiments we use 30 clients and train the models over only 2000 rounds, since some of these algorithms have a high overhead and many hyperparameters to search. We keep the same local batch size of 64 and 3 local iterations from the base case. Combining each of the methods with WSM we confirm our hypothesis that using WSM to mitigate local client forgetting provides improvement over the base cases for each method, in most cases the improvement is substantial. From Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of WSM ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> we remark that combining WSM with a baseline method generally provides a stronger performance from the very beginning of training since for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 the curves showing the training progression for the methods combined with WSM all start off with higher reported accuracy than the baselines and this improvement in performance persists for the duration of training. Work on critical learning periods, where critical learning periods are defined as the early epochs of a training regime, have shown they can determine the final quality of a deep neural network for traditional ML methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jastrzębski et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Achille et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yan et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> investigate critical learning periods in the FL setting and discover they do indeed exist consistently in FL. We can thus hypothesize that the early training advantage we see when applying WSM may be having a positive impact on its consistent ability to outperform other FL algorithms it is applied to.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The ease of application of WSM is a significant advantage since this feature makes it an easy way to achieve a substantial improvement over a baseline algorithm. Finally, we observe that combining WSM with FedAvg has the largest overall effect since the best overall method in table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Evaluation of WSM ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is FedAvg+WSM. While WSM does offer improvements over all baseline algorithms, this result is somewhat surprising since our intuition was that WSM would work independently alleviate local client forgetting and would augment the value of the modifications offered by the different federated learning algorithms. We theorize that the superior performance of FedAvg+WSM over SCAFFOLD+WSM or FedProx+WSM or Fed Nova+WSM is because while SCAFFOLD, Fed Nova and FedProx with WSM all individually improve the baseline, they may need to be further optimized to work effectively together.</p>

This
feature is significant since as explained above, low client participation is a known feature of
real world federated learning settings. We hypothesize the performance gap as a function of client fraction between the FedAvg and FedAvg+WSM is due to the larger impact of local client forgetting when we limit communication capability. Unless we actively take steps to control forgetting, non-participating clients will have their data distributions forgotten because unlike participating clients, they will be unable to contribute their updates to the global model. As the fraction of clients selected at each round increases, we observe the performance gap between the two methods narrow since more clients will have the opportunity to be selected at each round and "remind" the model of their data distributions.</p>

After 21 local iterations we observe a sharp decrease in accuracy for FedAvg as local iterations increase. While FedAvg+WSM does also experience a drop in accuracy as local iterations increase, its drop in accuracy is much less pronounced. This result is in line with what we would expect: since WSM helps to alleviate the effects of local client forgetting increasing the number of local training iterations will cause the effects of local client forgetting become more serious. The effect of WSM in allowing the local models to train for more local iterations without forgetting has important implications for the communication costs in FL. Since communication is a serious bottleneck and is limited by client drift, our method offers a valuable option to speed up training in a federated setting.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we took a deeper look at the <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local client forgetting</span> problem, we show that when a client performs local updates during FL, it risks overly optimizing its local objective leading to forgetting on other subsets of data. Local client forgetting degrades the performance of the global model and we show this phenomenon is especially severe in cases where there is a significant distribution mismatch across clients. First making the connection with the catastrophic forgetting problem in the continual learning, we propose a client level modification of the objective function which we call the weighted softmax. We show empirically that WSM allows us to mitigate client level forgetting by demonstrating improved performance for the FedAvg algorithm when combined with WSM across a range of learning rates. We also demonstrate these improvements are not limited to FedAvg since we also observe significant performance increases when WSM is applied to SCAFFOLD and FedProx. An ablation study demonstrated WSM is particularly effective in the regime of highly heterogeneous client datasets and/or when a small percentage of clients are selected at each round. Our results indicate that addressing local client forgetting in general is an important consideration for federated learning optimization, one that bears closer scrutiny.</p>

WSM outperforms vanilla FedAvg for each learning rate for both datasets. As with the ResNet-18 case, we continue to observe that WSM provides good performance over a larger range of learning rates than FedAvg which makes it easier to tune. We also observe WSM reduces the variance in model accuracy as evidenced by the typically lower standard deviations reported for the runs in each set.</p>
