<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of machine learning and a growing concern for data privacy, federated learning has become a focal point of attention. However, attacks on model parameters and a lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning. Therefore, we propose A Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and encourage active participation of nodes in model training. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing protection against tampering. Within the blockchain, we introduce a Proof of Training Work (PoTW) consensus algorithm tailored for federated learning, aiming to incentive training nodes. This algorithm rewards nodes with greater computational power, promoting increased participation and effort in the federated learning process. A novel adaptive differential privacy algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models. This safeguards the privacy of local data at training clients, preventing malicious nodes from launching inference attacks. Additionally, it enhances the security of the global model, preventing potential security degradation resulting from the combination of numerous local models. The possibility of security degradation is derived from the composition theorem. By introducing reverse noise in the global model, a zero-bias estimate of differential privacy noise between local and global models is achieved. Furthermore, we propose a new mix transactions mechanism utilizing ring signature technology to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL, compared to baseline methods, not only exhibits superior model performance but also achieves higher security.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) applications have become increasingly widespread in people’s work and daily lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, profoundly transforming both work and lifestyle. The application of various ML models provides more intelligent assistance, offering new ways for image, speech, and text recognition and processing. The progress in ML over the years has greatly enhanced work efficiency and the quality of life. However, ML is a double-edged sword. From a positive perspective, the powerful learning ability of ML for data has made it crucial in areas such as vision detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, text generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and intelligent transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. On the negative side, as ML model training requires extensive real datasets, incidents of privacy data leaks have become more frequent. Thus, safeguarding the privacy of ML training data has become a new focus<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging framework for training ML models while protecting the privacy of device data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, with broad application prospects. In the context of the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, FL has emerged to meet the growing demand for higher data privacy. In particular, FL shares only model parameters during the model training process, while training data remains stored locally on client devices. This means that we can better protect the privacy of training data while achieving model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are two inevitable challenges in FL: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inference-attacks</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-incentives</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Inference-attacks</span> may arise from malicious clients or the aggregation server. Although we only share model parameters in FL, these parameters contain certain training data information. Analyzing the model parameters shared by benign clients may lead to the inference of the data distribution or the presence of specific data in their training datasets. <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Client-incentives</span> refer to the scenario where, during the FL process, local training clients need to collaborate to accomplish the FL task. However, instances of ”lazy” clients may occur, where clients may not utilize all computational resources to complete the FL task or may fail to train for the specified number of rounds, resulting in poor performance of the local model. Client incentives aim to motivate local training clients to actively participate in FL tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Benefiting from FL’s outstanding performance in data privacy and security, many researchers have started incorporating homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to protect data. Researchers initially employed homomorphic encryption to encrypt transmitted model parameters. After performing homomorphic operations at the aggregation server, the computed results were returned to the local training clients. The local clients then decrypted the results to obtain the global model. In contrast, differential privacy methods involve centralizing data on the server, which adds differential privacy noise and provides services to data queryers. Unfortunately, these two methods fall short of addressing the issue of <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inference-attacks</span> . Firstly, homomorphic encryption requires significant computational resources, which may not meet the varied computing capabilities of local training clients in FL. Secondly, the differential privacy approach necessitates local training clients sending plaintext to the server, without guaranteeing the complete trustworthiness of the server. Lastly, traditional differential privacy methods, due to the randomness and uncontrollability of the added noise in terms of size and position, may even impact model performance.
In summary, it is crucial to design new methods to safeguard the privacy of FL training nodes and training data. This promotes the enthusiasm of local training nodes to participate in model training, enhancing the overall performance of the FL global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned obstacles, we propose a Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL). This model adds differential privacy noise to both local training clients and global model aggregation clients. The former protects the privacy of the local model’s training data, while the latter prevents the decrease in differential privacy security, as indicated by the composition theorem, when too many local models with local differential privacy noise are added in FL. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model enhances data security while ensuring model performance.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature. We start by briefly introducing the work on model parameter privacy protection in FL. Subsequently, we delve into the state-of-the-art approaches that employ differential privacy for safeguarding FL and the efforts in incorporating incentive mechanisms into FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Commonly used methods for preserving privacy of model parameters in FL include homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy. In homomorphic encryption, local training clients encrypt their model parameters using homomorphic encryption and send the encrypted parameters to the aggregation server. The server performs homomorphic calculations on the received encrypted parameters to obtain the aggregated encrypted global model parameters. The server then sends the global model parameters back to the local training clients, who decrypt the global model parameters locally and proceed with the next round of training. Secure multi-party computation usually employs homomorphic encryption techniques, allowing multiple FL participants to jointly compute the gradient updates of the model parameters without sharing the actual parameter values. Differential privacy, on the other hand, introduces a small amount of noise to the model parameters, providing a privacy guarantee without compromising model performance. It ensures privacy of the model parameters within a certain privacy budget, allowing the model to perform securely.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous studies have been conducted on FL and differential privacy technologies.
Kang Wei et al. introduced a novel framework based on the concept of differential privacy (DP), termed Noise Before Aggregation FL (NbAFL), where artificial noise is added to the client’s parameters before aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Stacey Truex et al. proposed LDP-Fed, which provides privacy guarantees in the form of local differential privacy (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In LDP-Fed, two novel methods are designed and developed. The LDP module of LDP-Fed offers formal differential privacy guarantees for repeatedly collecting model training parameters on private datasets from multiple individual participants during joint training of large-scale neural networks.
Yang Zhao et al. propose the integration of FL and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to facilitate the realization of ML models in crowdsourced applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Specifically, four LDP mechanisms are introduced to perturb gradients generated by vehicles. The three proposed output mechanisms incorporate three different output possibilities to achieve high accuracy under limited privacy budgets. The likelihood of the three outputs can be encoded using two bits, effectively reducing communication costs.
Antonious M. Girgis et al. address a distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) optimization problem with considerations for communication efficiency and privacy requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, as motivated by the federated learning (FL) framework . A distributed communication-efficient and locally differentially private stochastic gradient descent (CLDP-SGD) algorithm is proposed, and its trade-offs between communication, privacy, and convergence are analyzed.
Bin Jia et al. have designed an application model for blockchain-based federated learning in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and have formulated a data protection aggregation scheme based on the proposed model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Xicong Shen et al. have developed a performance-enhanced DP-based Federated Learning (PEDPFL) algorithm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The paper introduces a classifier perturbation regularization method to enhance the robustness of the trained model to differential privacy-induced noise.
Laraib Javed et al. describe a secure and reliable data sharing architecture and semantic approach based on blockchain, Local Differential Privacy (LDP), and Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The proposed framework establishes a trustless environment where data owners no longer need to trust a central controller.
Yuntao Wang et al. design a novel block structure, new transaction types, and credit-based incentives in PF-PoFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. PF-PoFL allows efficient outsourcing of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, collaborative mining, model evaluation, and reward allocation in a fully decentralized manner while resisting deception and Sybil attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, there is considerable research on how to incentivize local training clients to perform better in federated learning.
Yufeng Zhan et al. investigated incentive mechanisms in federated learning to motivate edge nodes to participate in model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Specifically, they designed an incentive mechanism based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to determine the optimal pricing strategy for the parameter server and the optimal training strategy for edge nodes.
Han Yu et al. proposed a Federated Learning Incentive (FLI) profit-sharing scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The scheme aims to jointly maximize collective utility while minimizing inequality among data owners, dynamically allocating a given budget among data owners in a context-aware manner in the federated setting.
Yufeng Zhan et al. examined incentive mechanism design in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, introducing a classification of existing incentive mechanisms in federated learning. They further conducted an in-depth discussion by comparing and contrasting different methods.
Wen Sun et al. considered dynamic digital twins and federated learning in a space-ground network, where drones serve as aggregators and ground clients capture the dynamically evolving network through digital twin-based collaborative training models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Han Yu et al. proposed FL Incentivizer (FLI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. It dynamically allocates a given budget among data owners in federated settings in a context-aware manner.
Yongheng Deng et al. introduced a new framework, FAIR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, for Federated Learning with Quality Assurance. FAIR integrates three main components: 1) Learning Quality Estimation; 2) Quality-Aware Incentive Mechanism; and 3) Automatic Weighted Model Aggregation.
Yanru Chen et al. integrated reputation-based and payment-based incentive measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, introducing ”reputation coins” as cryptocurrency for data-sharing transactions to encourage users to participate honestly in the data-sharing process based on federated learning.
Tianle Mai et al. designed a dual auction mechanism for the FL service market <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, where trained models can automatically trade between AIoT devices and FL platforms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, more effective methods for preserving model parameter privacy and encouraging the engagement of training clients in federated learning are still areas that require further research. Moreover, there is a need for more attention to identity protection for local training clients in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain technology was initially proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 within Bitcoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. It sequentially connects blocks storing transaction records in a chain-like fashion, utilizing cryptographic algorithms to ensure the immutability and authenticity of the blocks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. A block is divided into two parts: the block header and the block body. The block header contains identifiers for the previous, current, and next blocks, a timestamp, and the Merkle root of the transactions forming a Merkle tree within the block body. The block body comprises transactions generated in the blockchain network during a specific time period. The transactions are pairwise hashed, ultimately producing a hash that serves as the Merkle root. This root is stored in the block header, and if transactions within the block are tampered with, the Merkle root will change. Consistency in the Merkle root ensures the tamper resistance of transactions within the block. A hash generated by comprehensively calculating the block content and timestamp serves as the block identifier. Blocks are connected through identifiers, and if the block content changes, the identifier changes accordingly, using the unidirectionality of hash functions to guarantee identifier uniqueness and block tamper resistance. In addition to tamper resistance, blockchain also possesses features such as public transparency, traceability of transaction records, and collaborative maintenance. Transaction records on the blockchain are broadcasted throughout the network, allowing nodes in the network to inspect the content of transactions within each block. Transaction records are stored in the blockchain, ensuring traceability.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Consensus algorithms, as a critical component of blockchain, ensure data consistency and consensus security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Nodes in the blockchain network compete for mining rights based on rules set by consensus algorithms. For instance, in the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm adopted by the Bitcoin network, nodes collectively solve a mathematical problem, with the algorithm dynamically adjusting the difficulty of the problem. The node that solves the problem first becomes the mining node and has a higher probability of being a mining node if it possesses greater computational power, leading to the receipt of block packaging rewards. In another consensus algorithm, Proof of Stake (PoS)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, nodes are ranked based on the quantity of stake they hold, with the node having the most stake becoming the mining node. Compared to PoW, PoS significantly reduces the computational resource consumption associated with competing for mining rights. However, it faces the challenge of centralization of packaging rights, as a single node may consecutively obtain packaging rights, posing a threat to consensus security.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.9" class="ltx_p">The mixing mechanism was first proposed by D. Chaum in 1981 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. In this approach, both communicating parties utilize an intermediary to transmit communication information that has undergone asymmetric encryption. Attackers are unable to discern the identities of the communicating parties or the connection between them through the analysis of encrypted information. Presently, mixing mechanisms can be classified into centralized and decentralized methods. In centralized mixing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, users initially send tokens to a centralized mixing server. The central server aggregates users’ transaction requests into a single transaction and decomposes the original output into outputs of equal value. Subsequently, the server proposes the transaction to the blockchain and charges a certain service fee. For example, if user <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="U_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi

The coordinator sends the anonymous transaction to the blockchain network, and nodes involved in the anonymous transaction collectively pay the split anonymous transaction fee.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a scenario in a FL model where only one node in the local training nodes is known to be benign, while the others are untrusted nodes. There is a possibility that malicious nodes attempt to infer the local parameters of the benign node based on the global model, thereby obtaining information about the data distribution of the benign node. Assuming that the aggregation server is also untrusted and the communication network is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack, how can we protect the model parameters of the benign node and prevent inference attacks?

After obtaining the Content Identifier (CID) of the global model from the blockchain, they download global model parameters from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for local training. The updated local model is uploaded to IPFS and retrieved by the aggregation node for aggregation. The aggregated global model is then uploaded to IPFS, and the CID pointing to the location of the global model in IPFS is stored on the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Storing local and global model parameters in IPFS returns a CID. The CID is essentially a hash based on the content of the stored file. Compared to the original file, the CID has a smaller volume. Storing all CIDs generated during the FL process on the blockchain does not excessively consume storage space. Additionally, it improves efficiency in network transmission during the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Both local model parameters and global model parameters undergo differential privacy processing before transmission. Applying differential privacy to local models protects the original parameters from disclosure, thereby ensuring the privacy of local data. Applying differential privacy to global models safeguards against inference attacks and protects the local data of benign nodes. According to the <span id="S4.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">composition theorem</span> in differential privacy, when there are many local models in FL, the security guarantee of the combined global model will be reduced. To solve this problem, we apply reverse differential privacy to the global model to ensure effective model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The aggregation node finds the local model based on the CID stored in the blockchain. As the aggregation node is untrustworthy, we employ ring signature technology to protect the identity of local training nodes from being revealed. While blockchain technology enhances the traceability of transaction content and improves the security of FL algorithms, the transparency of blockchain content allows all nodes in the network to view it. Using ring signature hides the CID contained in transactions, providing greater efficiency compared to traditional ring signatures and addressing the issue of transparent data in blockchain technology.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we propose the Proof of Training Work consensus algorithm.

The results indicate that our method achieved better model performance while ensuring differential privacy.
This enhancement stems from the introduced weight distance calculation method, perturbation equation, and the probability distribution of the Bernoulli variable, which, while maintaining the same guarantees of differential privacy security, reduces the addition of differential privacy noise. This reduction contributes to superior model performance under the given conditions.</p>

In contrast, when using the PoTW consensus algorithm, nodes with higher computational capabilities receive more stake. This is because the PoTW consensus algorithm selects the node with the strongest computational power in the current round as the packing node, which earns more rewards. At the same time, the packing node does not participate in the current round’s model training, making it ineligible to be selected as the packing node in the next round. In the PoS consensus algorithm, the packing node is chosen based on the node’s coin age. When the coin ages of different nodes are similar, the likelihood of different nodes becoming the packing node is also similar. Therefore, in the PoS consensus algorithm, the stake amounts of different nodes are not identical but are similar. In the PoTW consensus algorithm, the nodes with the highest computational power in the first few nodes receive the most stake, while the stake of the remaining nodes remains consistent.</p>
