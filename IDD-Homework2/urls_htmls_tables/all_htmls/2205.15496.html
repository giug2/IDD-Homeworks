<p id="2.1" class="ltx_p">The role of deep learning (DL) in robotics has significantly deepened over the last decade. Intelligent robotic systems today are highly connected systems that rely on DL for a variety of perception, control and other tasks. At the same time, autonomous robots are being increasingly deployed as part of fleets, with collaboration among robots becoming a more relevant factor. From the perspective of collaborative learning, federated learning (FL) enables continuous training of models in a distributed, privacy-preserving way.
This paper
focuses on vision-based obstacle avoidance for mobile robot navigation. On this basis, we explore the potential of FL for distributed systems of mobile robots enabling continuous learning via the engagement of robots in both simulated and real-world scenarios.
We extend previous works by studying the performance of different image classifiers for FL, compared to centralized, cloud-based learning
with a priori aggregated data.
We also introduce an approach to continuous learning from mobile robots with extended sensor suites able to provide automatically labelled data while they are completing other tasks. We show that higher accuracies can be achieved by training the models in both simulation and reality, enabling continuous updates to deployed models.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vision-based obstacle avoidance is an important enabler for widespread autonomous robot navigation and could also help visually handicapped citizens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In general, vision sensors have been having an increasing role in intelligent robotic systems, as advances in deep learning (DL) have led to new state-of-the-art solutions mobile navigation, human-like walking, teaching through demonstration, and collaborative automation, among others in areas such as advanced perception and intelligent control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we extend the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> on federated learning for vision-based obstacle avoidance in mobile robots towards analyzing different architectures and, most importantly, introducing an strategy for continuous learning from both simulated and real robots carrying out different missions requiring autonomous navigation. There are a number of works in the literature showing the potential of DL for vision-based obstacle avoidance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and works integrating other techniques such multi-view structure-from-motion for enhanced performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, in addition to the use of DL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the methods are also validated in the real world, a federated learning (FL) framework is introduced, and the effects of learning through heterogeneous environments are analyzed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning enables sharing knowledge without transferring raw data. Therefore, FL allows for privacy-preserving distributed learning, which can then be enhanced by other technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, has been utilized in multiple domains in robotics and autonomous system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce an strategy for continuous learning together with federated learning and validating it in the real world.
In addition to real-world robots, we also utilize simulations to obtain enough data for training the DL models. Due to the proliferation of photorealistic simulators in robotics fields, studies are increasingly relying on these simulators to supplement data collection in situations where we cannot reach or collect sufficient data. In addition, through these types of simulators, the deployment of robotic and autonomous systems can be more accessible. In this way, we believe it may be beneficial for real-world vision-based obstacle avoidance in the real world. Throughout their lives, humans and animals can acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills. It is instrumental and interesting for robots to have the same type of learning capabilities. To continually learn the model for obstacle avoidance like humans, we involved multiple robots performing other tasks in different places, including the simulator, into the FL-based lifelong learning system for data collection, model training, and model sharing. We compare the performance of both AlexNet and ResNet18 with centralized and federated learning approaches to model training. We evaluate the model on different synthetic and real-world datasets, and train the models on combinations of different subsets to better study the effect of environment heterogeneity during the training phase. New data is also acquired with a Clearpath Husky mobile robot while it is operating other tasks and autonomously navigating a new indoors environment. The new data is automatically labelled with additional sensor suited. This opens the door to wider usage of heterogeneous robot fleets where robots with additional sensor capabilities can generate labelled data to train models able to reproduce their autonomous behaviour with more limited sensors, mainly cameras.

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Aided by AI, especially DL, each robot can have a model representing the environment based on their situated awareness. Different robots may have the limitation of detecting the environment due to their limited resources. It is of great necessity to have a collective model to share their knowledge about the environment. Instead of an individual robot, in a multi-robot system, multiple robots, situated in various whereabouts, collaboratively performing particular tasks is more efficient and of high success rate in heterogeneous environments including unknown ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, because of the limits of scenarios where vision-based obstacle avoidance is applied, it is still challenging for DL to collect enough visual inputs for collaborative learning and share them with other agents for privacy and security reasons. To address these concerns, we proposed an approach that included FL, Sim-to-Real (Sim2Real) via a photorealistic simulator, and Lifelong Learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we investigated the possibility of federated and continuous learning within hybrid teams of simulated and real robotic agents in this work. We then evaluate the performance benefits of such an approach over offline learning or learning from more limited data sources. First, we evaluate two different deep obstacle avoidance neural networks with both synthetic and real-world data. For both of the architectures
a FL-based knowledge sharing method (where the locally trained models are fused) is compared to a centralized training approach (where raw data needs to be aggregated before the training starts). Both models are validated with data from the photorealistic simulator and real-world environment separately.
Second, we analyzed the sim-to-real performance of two different deep obstacle avoidance models generated by FL methods, with our results showing that FL outperforms the centralized data aggregation methods. Third, we integrate lidar-based navigation for automated labelled data gathering. We implemented an online FL-based visual obstacle avoidance system both in a simulator and real-world environment. With such a system, we can continuously collect data from obstacles and free paths and train the model while the robots operate other tasks.

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review related works in FL for autonomous robots, sim-to-real transfer and lifelong robot learning. The methodology followed for obtaining the results reported in the manuscript is then introduced in Section III, with Section IV delving into the actual experimental results. Finally, section V concludes the paper and outlines future work directions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-robot collaboration and DL for robotics have both played an increasingly important role in multiple robotic applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, most of the work to date in learning from real-world experiences, sim-to-real transfer, and continuous learning, has been dedicated to reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and robotic manipulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Within the possibilities to achieve collaborative learning, one of the most straightforward approaches is cloud-based centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, with a server where data is aggregated and training occurs at once or in batches, but in an offline manner. Federated learning, in contrast, offers a distributed solution to collaborative learning where, in turn, the process is privacy-preserving (raw data can be processed locally). It also allows for management of networking resources (choosing when and how to transfer the models) through distributed computation at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the area of lifelong learning and continuous learning for robotics, the literature has been in general dedicated to simulation environments only. While AI advances the intelligence of robots in various subfields of robotics, numerous challenges remain with real-world application, particularly in an unknown environment. Among these limitations are a lack of open-ended learning about item categories and scenes, the absence of a global navigation map, and the occurrence of object collisions, particularly in dynamic environments. With the assistance of Lifelong learning, the robot should be able to learn new object categories continuously and comprehend affordances, especially for robots manipulating tasks from a small number of on-site training examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Lifelong learning for navigation is a good application of lifelong learning. Compared with the traditional planner in navigation, this learning approach can improve the navigation performance based on its own experience and retain the ability after learning new ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of deep learning vision-based obstacle avoidance, this has been a researched topic partly owing to the higher degree of maturity of DL methods for vision data in comparison to other modalities such as lidar data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Cameras are also more widely available and are relatively inexpensive sensors, while the methods can be generalized to various environments owing to the lack of the need for specific geometric or topological features. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, autonomous aerial robots are deployed with minimal knowledge of the environment and obstacle avoidance is achieved through a single monocular camera. With models trained through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), noise to data in the training phase can bring increased resilience to changes in the environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a method that is typical in other DRL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we also exploit heterogeneity of environments to show how a wider variety of the training data brings performance improvements to the DL models, especially when they are trained with a FL approach.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the domain of sim-to-real to transfer for DL policies driving autonomous behaviour in robotic system, the most widely studied learning algorithms are DRL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Sim-to-real transfer with DRL has been particularly studied in depth in problems involving dexterous manipulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Even in this area, recent works in the literature also show the potential of DRL for vision-based obstacle avoidance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section presents experimental results obtained using data from both simulated and real robots. We first demonstrate the performance of various knowledge-sharing approaches for obstacle avoidance using AlexNet and ResNet18 models before delving into the possibility of sim-to-real knowledge transferability. Finally, we demonstrated the FL method’s ability to facilitate lifelong learning by having Husky performing simulation and real-world navigation tasks.

The results are summarized in <a href="#S3.T1" title="In III-C Proposed FL Based Lifelong Learning Obstacle Avoidance ‣ III Methodology ‣ Towards Lifelong Federated Learning in Autonomous Mobile Robots with Continuous Sim-to-Real Transfer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> where the AUC values for AlexNet-based and ResNet18-based models are enclosed with a bracket in order. This metric enables a better understanding of the models’ reliability. In the context of robotic navigation, there is indeed a cost differential between false negatives over false positives in terms of the robots’ integrity. However, from the point of view of performance, false positives can significantly degrade the navigation speed and time, while low-frequency collisions can be avoided with other sensors, considering as well that a false negative is not necessarily consistent over time and multiple observations of the same obstacle are processed before a collision may happen.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For both AlexNet and ResNet18, the AUC results together with the accuracy boxplots show that there is a performance boost with the federated learning approach in contrast to the centralized learning method where all data is first aggregated in a single training set.</p>

Regarding AlexNet, fusing the models either from simulation or real-world can improve the accuracy of the vision-based obstacle avoidance. However, for ResNet18, our results show that fusing the local model from the simulator can improve the performance of the global model more than fusing the one from the real-world Husky. By fusing both of them, the accuracy can be improved, which shows the potential benefit of collaborative learning from both simulated and real robots.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work presents an FL-based lifelong learning method for vision-based obstacle avoidance among various mobile robots involving both simulated and real-world environments. Rather than applying a single deep neural network, we analyzed the performance of the FL-based method compared with the centralized data aggregation method with two different deep neural networks, providing to better generalize results. More specifically, we found that the FL approach can bring competitive accuracy compared to centralized learning across the simulated and real worlds while also delivering inherent benefits in communication optimization and data privacy preservation, enabling collaboration across organizations or users. Additionally, we evaluated the FL method’s sim-to-real vision-based obstacle avoidance performance. The result indicates that transferring the obstacle knowledge from simulation to reality using the FL method is more effective and stable. Within the FL-based lifelong learning system, one agent can improve its obstacle avoidance performance by aggregating models from local models in other agents situated either in simulated or real-world environments in our study.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we will concentrate on utilizing and adapting the FL-based lifelong learning system to perform other robotic navigation tasks with a view toward sim-to-real capabilities. We also find potential in dynamically adjusting the simulation environments based on real-world robot experiences, e.g., adding 3D models of new objects found.
