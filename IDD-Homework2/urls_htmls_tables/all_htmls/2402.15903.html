<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows multiple parties (distributed devices) to train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. How to effectively and efficiently utilize the resources on devices and the central server is a highly interesting yet challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient split federated learning algorithm (ESFL) to take full advantage of the powerful computing capabilities at a central server under a split federated learning framework with heterogeneous end devices (EDs). By splitting the model into different submodels between the server and EDs, our approach jointly optimizes user-side workload and server-side computing resource allocation by considering users’ heterogeneity. We formulate the whole optimization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is an NP-hard problem, and develop an iterative approach to obtain an approximate solution efficiently. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the significantly increased efficiency of our ESFL approach compared with standard federated learning, split learning, and splitfed learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In recent years, machine learning (ML) has attracted intensive attention in many fields and numerous artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as computer vision, smart health, connected and autonomous driving, information access control, and security surveillance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. According to Cisco <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, there were nearly <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="850" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">850</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">850</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">850</annotation></semantics></math> zettabyte of data generated by people, machines, and things at the network edge in <math id="S1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2021" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">2021</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1">2021</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1c">2021</annotation></semantics></math>. It is definitely infeasible to simply send this huge data volume to a central server to process or compute. To do so, a tremendous network bandwidth is required, incurring intolerable latency. Hence, distributed machine learning algorithms have been developed to cope with the aforementioned challenges for large geographically distributed volume of data by distributing the ML workloads to EDs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Moreover, awareness and concerns about users’ privacy have been raised in the digitalized world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Following the Privacy-by-Design (PbD) principle, the best way to achieve user privacy is not to disclose raw data, and so it would be more effective for EDs not to share private raw data as much as possible during the machine learning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</span> (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed ML technique enables EDs to collaboratively learn a global ML model without sharing their raw data, consequently reducing the requirement of communication bandwidth between EDs and a central server as well. The intuitive idea of privacy-preserving distributed ML was investigated independently by some researchers Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, Gong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> first constructed a distributed ML framework based on decentralized datasets held by different users, and claimed their algorithm as FL. The original FL algorithm updates ML models on EDs locally, and aggregates the updated ML models to obtain the global model at the central server remotely, in contrast to the traditional ML requiring EDs to upload their private data to where the ML model is trained. Since FL retains users’ private data on the EDs without sharing raw data with the server, the server only aggregates users’ locally updated models, as the privacy of end users is naturally preserved to some extent. Besides, as all training processes are performed by the EDs, the computation and communication capacities of EDs can also be utilized. FL provides various advantages, such as data privacy preservation, reduced communication latency, and enhanced learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, pushing all training workload to EDs sometimes is impracticable. Training complex ML models often consumes unacceptable amount of training memory and computing power on Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited communication and computing resources, and incurs intolerable latency. Besides, the ML model size sometimes reaches GBs (e.g., GPT-1 has 0.12 billion parameters, GPT-2 has 1.5 billion parameters, whereas GPT-3 has more than 175 billion parameters), resulting in a significant communications burden duo to the need of frequently uploading local ML models.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with the dilemma between insufficient ED resources and complicated ML models, we leverage another ML technique, called split federated learning (SFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which introduces model splitting from split learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to FL. The split federated learning framework was proposed by Thapa et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in 2020 to integrate federated learning with split learning, shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ ESFL: Efficient Split Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous Wireless Devices Guangyu Zhu and Tan F.

Under SFL framework, the main server helps the training process for each client, and the Fed server is tasked with the aggregation of all locally updated models. The SFL approach presents a compelling advantage for resource-constrained environments, since the main server undertake parts of local training workload.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the conventional FL and SFL implementations across heterogeneous devices, we have identified several limitations that can significantly impede the system’s overall performance and efficiency. In synchronous FL and SFL, the aggregation process is inherently constrained by the pace of the slowest participant due to the necessity for the server to collect updated local gradients from all selected EDs. This synchronicity results in a scenario where devices with abundant computational resources are rendered idle as they wait for the transmission of local models from less capable devices, often referred to as “straggler”. This inefficiency is primarily attributed to the varying and unpredictable communication and computational capabilities of the heterogeneous EDs. Therefore, addressing resource heterogeneity (RH), also called the system heterogeneity problem in FL, is critical to enhancing the efficiency and overall feasibility of SFL.</p>

The cornerstone of ESFL lies in its strategic utilization of heterogeneity in system resources and device capabilities. Unlike standard synchronous FL and SFL, our approach involves the server in the training phase but dynamically adjusts the distribution of user-side workload and server-side resources. The ESFL algorithm thereby capitalizes on the intrinsic resource variability across EDs to optimize ML outcomes and system efficiency.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There exist quite extensive research on splitting learning and federated learning in the current literature. In this section, we will concentrate on closely related works to review. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Ang et al. offered a robust architecture for FL to increase communication efficiency by reducing transmission noise in wireless networks. To address the communications overhead in FL, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> developed an algorithm, named Communication Mitigated Federated Learning (CMFL), to eliminate irrelevant local model updates that were trained over users’ biased data. It should be noted that the aforementioned two methods only address communication efficiency in FL, as all training processes are executed by the user-side EDs. FedMMD was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to reduce communication and computing costs during the local training process in FL using a two-stream model with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to replace the local training for a single model in FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, while this method reduces the number of communication rounds, it concurrently increases the user-side workload due to the need of computing the MMD loss. Wenqi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> address both communication and computing resource heterogeneities in wireless FL by providing a joint device scheduling and resource allocation strategy. Despite this integrated approach, the limitation of FL is still evident, as the user-side workload cannot be reduced.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Thapa et al. designed a novel framework, called <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">splitfed learning</span> (SFL), to take advantage of parallel training among different users in FL and the model splitting in SL to reduce the computing workload on EDs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, Gao et al. implemented SFL and evaluated the performance on IoT devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Lin et al. developed an efficient parallel split learning algorithm by applying the last-layer gradient aggregation to reduce communication and computing overheads in SL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Wu et al. designed a resource allocation strategy for cluster-based SFL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Kim et al. devised a bargaining game to negotiate the cut layer in personalized parallel SL. All aforementioned literature on SFL overlook the crucial aspect of the joint consideration of both user-side resource and workload heterogeneities. This oversight is evidenced by the fact that the cut layer remains the same at all EDs. However, it is obvious that adjusting cut layers can significantly change user-side workload distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the computing and communication workload at EDs when considering RH in FL, Sattler et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> designed a novel model compression algorithm to extend the commonly used top-k gradient sparsification to FL to compress both model uploading and downloading. However, since model compression inevitably results in performance degradation, it is advisable to maintain the integrity of the model architecture throughout the training process. With the emergence of edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, utilizing the computing resources at the both the central server and edges can be leveraged to reduce workload at EDs. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Wang et al. proposed to enable EDs to collaborate with edge nodes by exchanging model parameters to reduce the user-side workload, and to apply deep reinforcement learning to optimize the operations of mobile edge computing, caching, and communications. Several researchers attempted to leverage edge nodes to assist FL by fully uploading local training tasks to trusted edge nodes to reduce the user-side workload <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, the trustworthiness of training edge nodes is often hard to guarantee. Our ESFL algorithm introduce an integrated strategy for the allocation of server-side computing resource and user-side training workload. This approach is designed to accommodate the variations in computing and communication resources inherent in heterogeneous EDs. We will present the detailed design next.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While SFL only address the resource constraints at EDs, it does not account for the variations in data distribution (DH) and resource availability (resource heterogeneity or RH) inherent in EDs. Within a SFL framework, clients or EDs are required to partition their models following an identical structure, leading to a scenario where the communication and computational workload on the client side is influenced solely by the volume of data. In contrast, our Efficient Split Federated Learning (ESFL) takes a holistic approach, considering both the client-side workload and the server-side computing resource allocation, which is designed to mitigate “stragglers” problem in FL, thereby enhancing the training efficiency of SFL.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the training workload on user-side EDs, we split ML training into local training and server ML training. Thus, the next problem is how to appropriately determine user-side communication and computing workload, alongside the strategic allocation of computing resources on the server to different virtual servers. Due to the varying sizes of data collected by different users/EDs and the heterogeneous available resources on EDs, simply assigning the same amount of resources and randomly choosing the cut layers for different users will not help the training time and the performance. To maximize the training efficiency, one should address a joint optimization of workload and resource.</p>

From cutting-layer distributions, as the user-side resource becomes more sufficient, our ESFL applies more identical cutting-layer distributions strategies for all NNs. For the results in those two table, our ESFL algorithm significantly reduces one-round training and communication time under all circumstances. These advantages often stem from the dynamics between user-side computing and communication resource. In scenarios where local computing resource are poor whereas communication resource are rich (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RP</span>), ESFL remains less layers of user-side models leveraging more on server-side computing power. Conversely, under the PR scenario, ESFL mitigates these limitations by remaining more layers of user-side model to rely less on communication. Comparing one-round training and communication time of SFL and FL, an intriguing phenomenon emerges. Although SFL leverages the server-side resource to accelerate training, improper user-side workload allocation (model separation) and server-side resource allocation lead to decreased time efficiency.</p>

In the context of contrasting FL and SFL, it is imperative to acknowledge that although SFL, similar to ESFL, utilizes server-side computing resource, its overall performance is significantly influenced by by the harmonization of user-side workload and server-side resource allocation. The lack of effective resource allocation strategies can result in inferior performance in SFL when compared to FL. Especially in <span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RP</span> and <span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BR</span>, when communication resource are notably limited in EDs, FL outperforms SFL. This performance discrepancy can be attributed to the lack of effective allocating strategies, which results in SFL demonstrating inferior performance when compared to FL. Nevertheless, our ESFL exhibits a significant increase in efficiency compared to both FL and SFL across all tested scenarios. This provides the evidence that a well-conceived strategy for workload and resource allocation can markedly enhance the efficiency of the whole training process. While the model used here and other ML algorithms are not the state-of-the-art for this task, it does provide sufficient evidence to show that our ESFL can significantly reduce training latency and improve training efficiency by considering user-side resource heterogeneity.</p>

For the results in those two table, our ESFL algorithm significantly reduces one-round training and communication time under all circumstances and is least affected by resource heterogeneity, where both communication and computing heterogeneity seriously impact the training efficiencies of the other three ML algorithms. It is noteworthy that as the distribution of resources approaches a state of greater uniformity (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SH</span>), the gap of time efficiency between SFL and ESFL is decreased. Conversely, with an increase in resource heterogeneity (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LH</span>), the performance differential between ESFL and SFL widens notably, which highlight the robustness of ESFL in diverse resource environments. For instance, the training latency of SFL in <span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LH</span> is increased by nearly two times compared with that in <span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SH</span> while training latencies of ESFL are nearly the same in all scenarios.

It can be seen from the results that our ESFL method is significantly more efficient compared with the original FL, SL and SFL in most scenarios, only except VGG13 in <span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SL</span>. Comparing communication time of FL in SL and LS, the performance of FL is markedly impacted by the RH. However, ESFL capitalizes on these heterogeneities through strategic allocation: in the environment with low communication heterogeneity (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SL</span>), it increases the user-side communication workload while decreases computing workload; in the environment with high communication heterogeneity (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LS</span>), it conversely allocates more computing workload to EDs. Therefore, our approach optimizes the time efficiency across diverse scenarios by adaptively leveraging RH.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have designed ESFL, a novel distributed training approach that tackles the resource heterogeneity inherent in both federated learning and split learning. Unlike previous methods in addressing data heterogeneity in FL, we have provided a new perspective by allocating appropriate server-side resources and user-side workload to effectively address the straggler problem in the synchronous FL framework. By evaluating the training efficiency for different ML algorithms under different heterogeneous scenarios, we have performed extensive analysis and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed ESFL.</p>
