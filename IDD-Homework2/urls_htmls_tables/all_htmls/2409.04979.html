<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Perceiving the surrounding environment is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. To obtain highly accurate and robust perception results, modern autonomous driving systems typically employ multi-modal sensors, such as LiDAR, multi-view cameras, and millimeter-wave radar, to collect comprehensive environmental data. Among these, the radar-camera multi-modal perception system is especially favored for its excellent sensing capabilities and cost-effectiveness. However, the substantial modality differences between millimeter-wave radar and multi-view camera sensors pose significant challenges in fusing information from these two types of sensors. To address this problem, this paper presents RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection framework. Specifically, RCBEVDet is developed from an existing camera-based 3D object detection model, supplemented by a specially designed radar feature extractor, RadarBEVNet, and a radar-camera Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion (CAMF) module. Firstly, RadarBEVNet encodes sparse radar points into a dense bird’s-eye-view (BEV) feature using a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. Secondly, the CAMF module utilizes a deformable attention mechanism to align radar and camera BEV features and adopts channel and spatial fusion layers to fuse these multi-modal features. To further enhance RCBEVDet’s capabilities, we introduce RCBEVDet++, which advances the CAMF through sparse fusion, supports query-based multi-view camera perception models, and adapts to a broader range of perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method integrates seamlessly with existing camera-based 3D perception models and improves their performance across various perception tasks. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results in 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking tasks. Notably, with ViT-L as the image backbone, RCBEVDet++ achieves 72.73 NDS and 67.34 mAP in 3D object detection without test-time augmentation or model ensembling. The source code and models will be released at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VDIGPKU/RCBEVDet" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/VDIGPKU/RCBEVDet</a>.</p>

driving aims to improve safety, efficiency, and convenience in transportation by developing systems that allow vehicles to operate without human intervention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
A major challenge for these systems is to perceive the surrounding environment as comprehensively as humans do, which is crucial for accurate trajectory prediction and motion planning.
To achieve this, modern autonomous driving systems primarily employ three types of sensors, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, multi-view cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and LiDAR, to gather information about the surrounding environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Among these types of sensors, the LiDAR sensor provides detailed geometric information that significantly enhances the perception process, resulting in optimal performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
However, high-quality LiDAR sensors are expensive, which increases manufacturing costs.
In contrast, multi-view cameras and millimeter-wave radar sensors offer more economical alternatives for both manufacturers and users.
Compared with LiDAR, multi-view cameras capture intricate details such as color and texture, offering high-resolution semantic information, while the millimeter-wave radar sensor is superior in distance and velocity estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and performs reliably under diverse weather and lighting conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Besides, advancements in 4D millimeter-wave radar technology are gradually overcoming its limitation of sparse radar points, positioning it as a potential substitute <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Despite these advantages, a notable performance gap remains between LiDAR and camera or radar-based perception models.
A practical and effective strategy to bridge this gap involves integrating millimeter-wave radar with multi-view cameras, which complement each other and result in a more comprehensive and reliable perception.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To fuse radar and image data, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> primarily adopt the BEVFusion pipeline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> by projecting both multi-view image features and radar features into a bird’s eye view (BEV).
However, simple fusion techniques such as concatenation or summation, as employed by BEVFusion, fail to address spatial misalignment between multi-view images and radar inputs.
Moreover, most radar-camera fusion methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> still utilize encoders originally designed for LiDAR points, such as PointPillars, to extract radar features.
Though these methods yield commendable results, the LiDAR-specific encoders they use do not account for unique radar characteristics, such as the Radar Cross Section (RCS), resulting in sub-optimal performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a novel framework that effectively fuses radar and camera features in BEV space for the 3D object detection task.
To address the unique characteristics of radar inputs, we specially design RadarBEVNet for efficient radar BEV feature extraction.
Specifically, RadarBEVNet begins by encoding radar inputs into distinct point-based and transformer-based representations through a dual-stream radar encoder.
Besides, an Injection and Extraction module is implemented to integrate features from these two representations.
Subsequently, these features are transformed into BEV features via RCS-aware scattering, which leverages RCS as a prior for object size and allocates point features throughout the BEV space.
In addition to RadarBEVNet, RCBEVDet integrates a Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion Module (CAMF) to achieve a robust fusion of radar and camera features within the BEV space.
To be more specific, CAMF employs multi-modal cross-attention to adaptively correct coordinate mismatches between the two types of BEV features.
Then, channel and spatial fusion layers are applied to further consolidate the multi-modal features, enhancing the overall detection performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fully leverage the capabilities of RCBEVDet, we have upgraded the CAMF module with sparse fusion to support query-based multi-view camera perception models.
Additionally, we have broadened RCBEVDet’s functionality to encompass a broader range of
perception tasks, including 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking.
This enhanced framework is named RCBEVDet++.
Specifically, to adapt the CAMF module for query-based multi-view camera methods, which lack explicit camera BEV features, we replace the original camera BEV features with camera object queries that incorporate 3D coordinates.
This modification develops a new query component in our multi-modal cross-attention mechanism.
Then, we perform a project-and-sample process, where camera object queries are projected into the BEV space and matched with corresponding radar features to form radar object queries.
Subsequently, the multi-modal queries are aligned using deformable cross-attention.
Finally, the adjusted multi-modal queries are concatenated and sent to a simple linear layer for effective feature fusion, boosting perception performance across the expanded range of tasks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking are three fundamental perception tasks for autonomous driving.
Currently, many 3D multi-object tracking methods often adopt the Tracking-By-Detection framework, which utilizes results from 3D object detection to associate objects.
These tracking methods focus on object matching rather than efficiently processing input images.
Besides, more accurate detection results can bring higher tracking performance.
Therefore, in this section, we mainly discuss more diverse 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation methods that process multi-frame multi-view camera inputs.
Specifically, 3D object detection aims to predict the location and category of 3D objects, while semantic segmentation integrates vehicle recognition, semantic lane map prediction, and drivable area estimation tasks.
However, detecting objects and segmenting maps in 3D space using camera images is challenging due to insufficient 3D information.
In recent years, numerous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have made substantial efforts to address this issue, including inferring depth from images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, utilizing geometric constraints and shape priors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, designing specific loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and exploring joint 3D detection and reconstruction optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
More recently, multi-view sensors have become a popular configuration for autonomous vehicles, providing more comprehensive surrounding information. The emergence of multi-view camera datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> has led to the development of multi-view 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which can be broadly categorized into two approaches: geometry-based methods and transformer-based methods.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Geometry-based multi-view 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation predominantly utilize depth prediction networks to estimate the depth distribution in images.
This facilitates the conversion of extracted 2D image features into 3D camera frustum features.
Subsequently, operations such as Voxel Pooling are employed to construct features in the voxel or BEV space.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, as a pioneering work, Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> first employs a lightweight depth prediction network to explicitly estimate the depth distribution and a context vector for each image.
Then, the outer product of the depth and context vector determines the feature at each point in 3D space along the perspective ray, enabling the effective transformation of image features into BEV features.
Building on LSS, FIERY <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> introduces a future instance prediction model based on BEV, capable of predicting the future instances of dynamic agents and their motions.
BEVDet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> extends the viewpoint transformation technique from LSS to detect 3D objects using BEV features.
Additionally, BEVDepth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> leverages explicit depth information from LiDAR as supervision to enhance depth estimation and incorporates camera extrinsic parameters as a prior for depth estimation.

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Transformer-based methods leverage attention mechanisms to project predefined queries onto multi-view image planes using coordinate transformation matrices, subsequently updating the query features with multi-view image features.
Specifically, the pioneering work DETR3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> employs a transformer decoder for 3D object detection, developing a top-down framework and utilizing a set-to-set loss to measure the difference between ground truth and predictions.
Similarly, CVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> introduces a simple BEV semantic segmentation baseline using a cross-view transformer architecture. Following this, BEVformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> constructs dense BEV queries and incorporates multi-scale deformable attention to map multi-view image features to these dense queries.
Moreover, PETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> generates multi-view image features with explicit position information derived from 3D coordinates.
Building on PETR, PETRv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> integrates temporal fusion across multiple frames and extends 3D positional embedding with time-aware modeling.
Additionally, Sparse4D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> allocates and projects multiple 4D key points for each 3D anchor to generate different views, aspect ratio, and timestamp features, which are then fused hierarchically to improve the overall image feature representation. Sparse4Dv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> extends Sparse4D with a more efficient time fusion module and introduces camera parameter encoding and dense depth supervision.
More recently, StreamPETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> utilizes sparse object queries as intermediate representations to capture temporal information, and SparseBEV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> incorporates a scale-adaptive self-attention module and an adaptive spatio-temporal sampling module to dynamically capture BEV and temporal information.</p>

Concretely, RadarNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> introduces a multi-level radar-camera fusion pipeline to improve the accuracy of distant object detection and reduce velocity errors.
CenterFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> utilizes a keypoint detection network to generate initial 3D detection results from images and incorporates a pillar-based radar association module to refine these results by linking radar features with corresponding detected boxes.
Similarly, MVFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> achieves semantic alignment between cameras and millimeter-wave radar, enhancing the interaction between the two modalities.
Additionally, Simple-BEV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> investigates architecture designs and hyper-parameter settings for multi-sensor BEV perception systems.
CRAFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposes a proposal-level fusion framework that employs a Soft-Polar-Association and Spatio-Contextual Fusion Transformer to efficiently exchange information between the camera and millimeter-wave radar.
RADIANT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> develops a network to estimate positional offsets between radar echoes and object centers and leverages radar depth information to enhance camera features.
More recently, CRN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> generates radar-augmented image features with radar depth information for multi-view transformation and incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to address spatial misalignment and information disparity between radar and camera sensors.
RCFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> utilizes radar PillarNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> to generate radar pseudo-images and presents a weighted fusion module to effectively fuse radar and camera BEV features.
BEVGuide <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> builds on the CVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> framework and proposes a sensor-agnostic attention module based on BEV, facilitating BEV representations learning and understanding.
BEVCar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> introduces an innovative radar-camera fusion method for BEV map and object segmentation using an attention-based image lift strategy.</p>

Specifically, multi-view images are processed by an image encoder to extract features, which are then transformed into the image BEV feature using a view-transformation module. Concurrently, radar point clouds are encoded into the radar BEV feature by the proposed RadarBEVNet. Next, the image and radar BEV features are fused using the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module. Finally, the fused multi-modal BEV feature is employed for the 3D object detection task.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous radar-camera fusion methods typically utilize radar encoders designed for LiDAR point clouds, such as PointPillars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. In contrast, we introduce RadarBEVNet, specifically tailored for efficient radar BEV feature extraction.
RadarBEVNet encodes sparse radar points into a dense BEV feature using a dual-stream radar backbone and an RCS-aware BEV encoder. More specifically, the dual-stream radar backbone processes radar points into two representations: a local point-based representation and a global transformer-based representation, employing an Injection and Extraction module to fuse these representations. The RCS-aware BEV encoder leverages RCS as an object size prior, distributing the feature of a single radar point across multiple pixels in the BEV space.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current radar BEV encoders typically scatter point features into BEV space based on the 3D coordinates of the points.
However, this often results in a sparse BEV feature map, where most pixels contain zero values. This sparsity makes it difficult for some pixels to effectively aggregate features, potentially impairing detection performance.
One solution is to increase the number of BEV encoder layers, but this can cause small object features to be smoothed out by background features.
To address this issue, we propose an RCS-aware BEV encoder.
The Radar Cross Section (RCS) measures an object’s detectability by radar. For instance, larger objects generally produce stronger radar wave reflections, resulting in a larger RCS measurement. Thus, RCS can provide a rough estimate of an object’s size.
The key design of the RCS-aware BEV encoder is the RCS-aware scattering operation, which leverages the RCS as a prior estimate of the object’s size,
With this prior, the proposed scattering operation allows the feature of a single radar point to be scattered across multiple pixels in the BEV space, rather than being confined to a single pixel, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3.1.1 Dual-stream radar backbone ‣ 3.1 RadarBEVNet ‣ 3 RCBEVDet: Radar-camera fusion in BEV for 3D object detection ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Radar point clouds often suffer from azimuth errors, causing radar sensors to detect points outside the boundaries of objects. Consequently, radar features generated by RadarBEVNet may be assigned to adjacent BEV grids, resulting in misalignment with BEV features from cameras.
To address this issue, we use a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically align the multi-modal features.
Since unaligned radar points typically deviate from their true position by a small distance, we propose employing deformable cross-attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> to accurately capture and correct these deviations. Besides, the deformable cross-attention can reduce the computational complexity of the vanilla cross-attention from <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(H^{2}W^{2}C)"

Specifically, we first replace the original image BEV features with
image sparse features.
Then, we perform a project-and-sample process to associate each image sparse feature with a radar feature using 3D absolute position.
More specifically, we project the 3D absolute position into BEV and sample corresponding radar features with bilinear interpolation to obtain sparse radar features.
Next, we utilize the positional encoding network composed of MLP to transform the 3D absolute position into 3D positional embedding and add them to the multi-modal queries.
After that, to align the multi-modal mismatch, we adopt deformable cross-attention for sparse image features and dense radar BEV features, and simple cross-attention for sparse radar features and sparse image features as follows:</p>

For BEVDepth, we follow BEVDet4D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> to accumulate the intermediate BEV feature from multiple frames and add an extra BEV encoder to aggregate these multi-frame BEV features.

For the BEV semantic segmentation head, we adopt a separate segmentation head for each task.
For 3D multi-object tracking, we follow CenterPoint to utilize estimated velocity to track object centers across multiple frames in a greedy manner.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our models are trained in a two-stage manner.
In the first stage, we train the camera-based model following the standard implementations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
In the second stage, we train the radar-camera fusion model.
The weights of the camera stream are inherited from the first stage, and the parameters of the camera stream are frozen during the second stage.
All models are trained for 12 epochs with AdamW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> optimizer.
To prevent overfitting, we apply various data augmentations, including image rotation, cropping, resizing, and flipping, as well as radar horizontal flipping, horizontal rotation, and coordinate scaling.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the main components in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 RCBEVDet: Radar-camera fusion in BEV for 3D object detection ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, including RadarBEVNet and CAMF.
Specifically, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 5.3.1 Main Components ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, we successively add components to the baseline BEVDepth to compose RCBEVDet.
Firstly, based on the camera-only model, we build a radar-camera 3D object detection baseline with BEVFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> by adopting PointPillar as the radar backbone following CRN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
The baseline radar-camera detector achieves 53.6 NDS and 42.3 mAP, improving the camera-only detector by 1.7 NDS and 1.8 mAP.
Next, substituting PointPillar with the proposed RadarBEVNet yields 2.1 NDS and 3.0 mAP improvement, demonstrating RadarBEVNet’s strong radar feature representation capability. Furthermore, integrating CAMF boosts 3D detection performance from 55.7 NDS to 56.4 NDS.
Additionally, we follow Hop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> to incorporate extra multi-frame losses, termed Temporal Supervision, resulting in a 0.4 NDS improvement alongside a 0.3 mAP reduction.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, we observe that each component consistently improves 3D object detection performance. Meanwhile, the results demonstrate that multi-module fusion can significantly boost the detection performance.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Experimental results related to the design of RadarBEVNet, including the Dual-stream radar backbone and RCS-aware BEV encoder, are presented in Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ 5.3.1 Main Components ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.
Specifically, the baseline model, which uses PointPillar as the radar backbone, achieves 54.3 NDS and 42.6 mAP.
Integrating the RCS-aware BEV encoder enhances 3D object detection performance by 1.4 NDS and 1.9 mAP, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed RCS-aware BEV feature reconstruction.
Additionally, we find that the direct integration of the Transformer-based Backbone leads to marginal performance improvement.
This is attributed to the individual processing of radar points by the Point-based and Transformer-based backbones, which lack the effective interaction of their distinct radar feature representations.
To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Injection and Extraction module, resulting in a performance gain of 0.6 NDS and 0.8 mAP.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we conducted ablation experiments on the CAMF module, which includes the deformable cross-attention mechanism for aligning multi-modal features and the channel and spatial fusion module, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ 5.3.3 Cross-attention Multi-layer Fusion (CAMF) ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>.
Specifically, the baseline model with the fusion module from BEVfusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> achieves 55.7 NDS and 45.3 mAP.
When the Deformable Cross Attention is incorporated for multi-modal BEV feature alignment, the 3D detection performance improves from 55.7 NDS and 45.3 mAP to 56.1 NDS and 45.5 mAP. This highlights the effectiveness of the cross-attention mechanism in aligning cross-modal features.
Additionally, we notice that introducing the channel and spatial fusion module for BEV feature fusion obtains a performance increase of 0.3 NDS and 0.1 mAP compared to the one-layer fusion in BEVFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
This indicates that channel and spatial multi-layer fusion provides better multi-modal BEV features.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S5.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ 5.3.4 Sparse Fusion with CAMF ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a> presents the ablation for sparse fusion with CAMF.
The first row in Table <a href="#S5.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ 5.3.4 Sparse Fusion with CAMF ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a> denotes the SparseBEV baseline.
When only adopting deformable attention to align radar BEV features with image sparse features obtains performance gains of 1.2 NDS and 2.3 mAP.
After adding the radar query sample for multi-modal feature alignment further boosts detection performance by 2.4 NDS and 4.2 mAP.
Besides, we observe that replacing learnable positional encoding with non-parametric encoding (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, sine positional encoding) improves results by 1.9 NDS and 1.9 mAP.
Lastly, unlike CAMF in RCBEVDet, linear fusion outperforms multi-layer fusion (MLP in Table <a href="#S5.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ 5.3.4 Sparse Fusion with CAMF ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>).
The reason is that the BEV features are 2D dense features, which require spatial and channel fusion.
In contrast, sparse query features are 1D features; thus, a linear fusion layer is adequate for practice.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">BEV semantic segmentation in nuScenes needs to complete three tasks, including vehicle, drivable area, and lane segmentation.
To achieve an optimal balance among these tasks, we adjust the loss weights of the three tasks and present the results in Table <a href="#S5.T10" title="TABLE X ‣ 5.4 Task Trade-off in BEV semantic segmentation ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">X</span></a>.
We observe that applying equal loss weights for each task obtains 57.7 mIoU.
By progressively increasing the loss weights of vehicle and lane classes while decreasing the loss weights for the drivable area, segmentation performance first improves from 57.7 mIoU to 59.5 mIoU, reaching its peak, and then declines to 58.9 mIoU.
The best task trade-off is achieved with loss weights of 400, 80, and 200 for vehicle, drivable area, and lane, respectively; further increasing loss weights for vehicle and lane classes can hurt the segmentation performance of all three tasks.</p>

Besides, we visualize how CAMF addresses radar misalignment in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.4 Task Trade-off in BEV semantic segmentation ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
As illustrated, many radar features exhibit positional offsets from ground-truth boxes. With CAMF, these radar features are realigned within the ground-truth boxes, effectively correcting the radar misalignment.</p>

To further distinguish our method from CRN, we present the architecture details of the fusion module in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.5.3 Comparison with CRN ‣ 5.5 Analysis of Robustness ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
Specifically, CAMF in RCBEVDet first aligns features from the camera and radar separately and then fuses aligned features using several convolutional blocks.
In contrast, MDCA in CRN first fuses features from two modalities. Then, it uses the fused features, image features, and radar features as the query, key, and value, respectively, and applies deformable attention to adjust the fused features.
Thus, the fusion-then-alignment pipeline of MDCA in CRN has limited alignment precision because it still has feature mismatches in the camera and radar fusion process.
In comparison, our CAMF, which employs an alignment-then-fusion pipeline, fully leverages the alignment capabilities of deformable attention in the first step and achieves better feature fusion robustness.

<div id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the detector architecture generalization of our method by plugging it into various mainstream multi-view camera-based 3D object detectors, including LSS-based (<span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, BEVDet and BEVDepth) and transformer-based methods (<span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, StreamPETR and SparseBEV).
These methods represent a range of detector designs.
As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T14" title="TABLE XIV ‣ 5.6.2 Generalization for 3D Detector Architecture ‣ 5.6 Model Generalization ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ RCBEVDet++: Toward High-accuracy Radar-Camera Fusion 3D Perception Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">XIV</span></a>, our method boosts the performance of all popular multi-view camera-based 3D object detectors by fusing radar features.
Specifically, for the LSS-based method, RCBEVDet improves 5.6 NDS and 4.9 NDS for BEVDet and BEVDepth, respectively.
For the transformer-based detectors, RCBEVDet++ obtains similar performance gains in NDS, <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, 5.6 NDS and 5.9 NDS improvement for StreamPETR and SparseBEV, respectively.
Notably, we observe more mAP improvements in transformer-based methods compared to LSS-based methods.
The reason is that LSS-based methods typically use depth supervision from LiDAR points for more accurate 3D position prediction, while transformer-based methods learn 3D position implicitly.
Consequently, the transformer-based methods can derive more benefits from radar features, which provide additional depth information.
Overall, these results demonstrate the detector architecture generalization of our method across various 3D object detectors.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we first introduce RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D detector.
It comprises an existing camera-based 3D detection model, a specially designed radar feature extractor, and the CAMF module for aligning and fusing radar-camera multi-modal features.
RCBEVDet improves the performance of various camera-based 3D object detectors across several backbones and shows well robustness capability against sensor failure cases on the nuScenes dataset.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To unleash the full potential of RCBEVDet, we propose RCBEVDet++, which extends the CAMF module to support query-based multi-view camera perception models with sparse fusion and adapts to more perception tasks, including 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that RCBEVDet++ further boosts the performance of camera-based perception models and achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera multi-modal results on these three perception tasks.
Notably, without using test-time augmentation or model ensemble, RCBEVDet++ obtains 72.73 NDS and 67.34 mAP for 3D object detection with ViT-L as the image backbone.</p>
