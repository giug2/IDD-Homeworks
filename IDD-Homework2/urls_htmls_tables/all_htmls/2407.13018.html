<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Regardless of their variations, blockchains require a consensus mechanism to validate transactions, supervise added blocks, maintain network security, synchronize the network state, and distribute incentives. Proof-of-Work (PoW), one of the most influential implementations of consensus mechanisms, consumes an extraordinary amount of energy for a task that lacks direct productive output. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a multi-winner federated learning validated consensus mechanism that redirects the computation power of blockchains to train federated learning models. In addition, we present a novel evaluation mechanism to ensure the efficiency of the locally trained models of miners. We evaluated the security of our evaluation mechanism by introducing and conducting probable attacks. Moreover, we present a novel reward distribution mechanism to incentivize winning miners fairly, and demonstrate that our reward system is fair both within and across all rounds.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decentralized nature of blockchain technology, the incentive mechanisms supporting blockchain networks, and smart contracts—which enable programmable and automated transactions—have all contributed to blockchain’s explosive expansion. The Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which rewards miners for their computing efforts to maintain the network, requires substantial computational power to preserve data integrity and security. The most well-known use of PoW, Bitcoin mining, has an energy demand that is currently equal to the yearly energy usage of nations like Poland <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These serious environmental issues emphasize the need for more effective consensus mechanisms to retain blockchain’s advantages while mitigating its environmental impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The PoW mechanism tasks miners by finding a specific nonce value via trial and error and rewarding the first successful miner. Because of the inefficiency of this brute-force approach, proposals have emerged to replace it with a more meaningful puzzle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Other studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have also suggested alternatives with less computational requirements, using various consensus models that focus on efficiency and lower energy consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), first proposed by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, is a collaborative machine learning approach that trains models across distributed networks. FL improves privacy by retaining data on individual client devices, sharing only model updates with the central server. However, this approach still raise privacy concerns for both the server and clients within an FL network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. An incentive mechanism can motivate clients to truthfully contribute to the global model, thereby strengthening the server’s security. In addition, a decentralized governance scheme can eradicate the security concerns of the clients. Hence, to address these problems, Kim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-enabled FL system where model updates are verified and communicated using blockchain and smart contracts. Since then, numerous studies have expanded on this concept, applying it to various technological domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, requesters send Deep Learning (DL) tasks along with a list of possible data providers. These tasks are distributed among distinct pools of miners, with each pool selecting a DL model for the task. In each pool, a miner is selected as the leader and acts as the central server in the traditional FL paradigm, while others operate as clients. However, there are two major drawbacks to this approach: i) FL is only achieved in pools with a limited number of miners, thereby undermining the efficiency of models trained, and ii) the framework lacks fairness because the winning global model is not shared with other pools. This leads to an unfair advantage for pools that win in the initial rounds. This disparity significantly affects miners who join the competition in the middle or final rounds.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Accordingly, this paper presents Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a novel decentralized multi-winner FL consensus mechanism that improves model evaluation by using a distributed network of miners. In our framework, miners distribute unlabeled test records to evaluate the trained local models of other miners, who predict these records and report their results. These predictions are evaluated based on accuracy (loss value) and timeliness (prediction time) parameters. Through the implemented smart contacts, top <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> miners receive the highest votes and are selected as winners of each round. Consequently, these winners contribute their models to form an updated global model, and the implemented smart contracts fairly reward them based on the significance of their contributions. This system addresses critical challenges in conventional FL-based consensus mechanisms, such as fairness and incentive alignment, while enhancing overall efficiency.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Initially, Nakamoto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> introduced Proof-of-Work (PoW) for Bitcoin. To maintain the ledger’s integrity, miners must find a nonce that meets specific hash conditions when adding to the block header. The search for an appropriate nonce value is notably computation-intensive, driving research into more efficient alternatives, leading to solutions for resource-efficient and energy-recycling consensus mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies have introduced consensus mechanisms that are more efficient and less energy-intensive than Proof-of-Work (PoW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. For instance, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), suggested by Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, grants validators with high stakes the privilege to add new blocks. Proof-of-Work-Time (PoWT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> seeks to increase mining efficiency and reduce computational waste by incorporating a block time parameter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Proof-of-Burn (PoB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> encourages miners to “burn” coins by sending them to an address from which they cannot be recovered in exchange for increased virtual mining power. Expanding on these innovations, Proof-of-History (PoH) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> provides a chronological verification of events, enhancing blockchain efficiency by confirming transaction sequences. Proof-of-Activity (PoA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> combines the principles of PoW and PoS, starting with a mining process and subsequently transitioning to a stake-based validator selection for block finalization, thereby bolstering both network security and energy efficiency.</p>

Primecoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> searches for prime number sequences.

PoFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> engages miners in training models within mining pools to compete for rewards, leading to an unfair advantage for the winning pool in early rounds as the victorious model is not shared among pools.

Similarly, Proof-of-Training-Quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> faces similar issues by implementing FL in local committees.</p>

A standard FL network comprises a central server and several client devices. The process begins with the server distributing the global model to each client. Clients then train this model locally using their private datasets. Once training is complete, clients send their model updates back to the central server. The server aggregates these updates to enhance the global model. This cycle of distribution, local training, and aggregation constitutes one round of FL. Multiple such rounds are conducted, allowing the global model to progressively improve in accuracy and performance as it learns from a broader range of data across the network. While FL was first introduced within the realm of machine learning, numerous studies, including this paper, have explored its application in training deep learning models in a distributed manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Each round is started by selecting a global deep-learning model from the request queue and sending it to the miners, who in turn ask for validated transactions to mine and start training. After receiving their designated transactions and training the global model using their local data, the miners form a model proposal block including the hash of the trained model and a set of unlabeled test records. A curated set of test cases is distributed to clients, ensuring that these cases are representative of the overall data distribution while not compromising data privacy. This step is crucial for evaluating the local models under similar conditions, providing a fair basis for comparison.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At the initiation of each round, miners are notified of a period called the model proposal deadline. Miners should take the actions mentioned above and send their model proposal block before the deadline passes; otherwise, they will not be included in the following steps. The administrator determines the model proposal deadline which can vary from one system to another based on distinct miner needs and global models. In some cases, a global model may require more training time to reach an adequate training level. Hence, we consider this as a custom value for the employers of our system.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To select the best models, an evaluation step must be performed. In our FL framework, We address the quality of the locally trained model by implementing a distributed evaluation protocol. This protocol allows us to assess the performance of local models trained on miners’ devices, ensuring that contributions to the global model are made by the most effective miners.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">After passing the model proposal deadline, the submitted test records are collected and sent to miners who participated in the model proposal step. The miners predict the given test records by feeding the inputs to the model. Afterward, they forward the predictions to a smart contract, managing all miner predictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To prevent miners from deducing the correct labels of the test records through any means other than their trained models, we restrict the prediction proposal phase by setting a deadline. This deadline is carefully calibrated to be just sufficient for the execution of a forward pass of the global model. Proposals submitted after this deadline are not accepted to ensure the integrity of the evaluation process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Setting the prediction proposal deadline is another responsibility of the administrator, and its duration may vary between systems in distinct cases. Nevertheless, the general rule is to conduct an experiment and calculate the average time it takes miners to complete a forward pass of the global model and send the results. This empirically determined duration can then serve as the basis for establishing the prediction proposal deadline.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The vote proposal phase is crucial in identifying and distinguishing between honest miners and potential adversaries. During this phase, miners evaluate the predictions submitted by their peers in the preceding step, considering two primary criteria: the loss value associated with the predictions and the time required for the miners to submit their predictions. Firstly, they rank predictions from most to least accurate. In instances of identical accuracy, preference is given to submissions that were made earlier. This prioritization encourages miners to comply with the guidelines set for the prediction proposal phase and to submit their predictions promptly. Furthermore, this approach enhances the system’s resilience against potential attacks discussed in the Security Concerns section.</p>

At the end of each round, the aggregator sends this information to the smart contract that issues rewards to the winning miners.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A potential threat to our FL validated consensus mechanism is the risk of miners not following the training rules. Specifically, there is a concern that some miners might attempt to mislead others by generating predictions using other supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms, such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), rather than adequately training the global FL model. In this section, we identify two scenarios where an adversary might employ such techniques, and we argue that in both scenarios, such adversaries will not succeed. Additionally, in the results section, we substantiate our assertion by conducting comprehensive simulations of KNN-based attacks across varying data sizes.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the effectiveness of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms can be similar to deep neural networks when data has low dimensionality. That is to say, either approach achieves satisfactory and similar results. In such instances, the complexity introduced by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may not significantly outperform simpler Fully Connected (FC) models. Therefore, we consider a simple, fully connected neural network for our global model in scenarios characterized by low-dimensional data. This decision is based on the principle that the data’s simplicity does not require the advanced feature extraction of CNNs, which are suited for high-dimensional datasets like images.</p>

The platform’s Chaincode-centric architecture, where Chaincodes function as smart contracts, allowed us to seamlessly integrate our consensus mechanism as a network layer on the existing Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure. We developed smart contracts (Chaincodes) for each critical operation within our comprehensive design. This design ensures that no single miner or central authority oversees network operations; instead, governance is distributed across a suite of smart contracts, ensuring decentralized control.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a multi-winner FL validated consensus mechanism that recycles the energy of the original proof of work. This framework trains the requested models globally using the computation power of the contributing miners. To evaluate miners’ performance and select winners, we proposed a novel evaluation step that relies on the predictions miners make on each other’s test records. In addition, we verified the robustness of our proposed evaluation mechanism by simulating an attack scenario on the mechanism and demonstrated how these attacks are ineffective in compromising the system. Finally, we proposed a novel reward distribution mechanism that compensates winning miners according to the significance of their contributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our reward distribution algorithm fairly compensates miners both within and across all rounds.</p>
