<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Traffic steering (TS) is a promising approach to support various service requirements and enhance transmission reliability by distributing network traffic loads to appropriate base stations (BSs). In conventional cell-centric TS strategies, BSs make TS decisions for all user equipment (UEs) in a centralized manner, which focuses more on the overall performance of the whole cell, disregarding specific requirements of individual UE.
The flourishing machine learning technologies and evolving UE-centric 5G network architecture have prompted the emergence of new TS technologies. In this paper, we propose a knowledge transfer and federated learning-enabled UE-centric (KT-FLUC) TS framework for highly dynamic 5G radio access networks (RAN). Specifically, first, we propose an attention-weighted group federated learning scheme.
It enables intelligent UEs to make TS decisions autonomously using local models and observations, and a global model is defined to coordinate local TS decisions and share experiences among UEs.
Secondly, considering the individual UE’s limited computation and energy resources, a growing and pruning-based model compression method is introduced, mitigating the computation burden of UEs and reducing the communication overhead of federated learning.
In addition, we propose a Q-value-based knowledge transfer method to initialize newcomer UEs, achieving a jump start for their training efficiency. Finally, the simulations show that our proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can effectively improve the service quality, achieving 65% and 38% lower delay and 52% and 57% higher throughput compared with cell-based TS and other UE-centric TS strategies, respectively.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the explosive growth of traffic demand has pushed network operators to continuously improve their management strategies to meet diverse service requirements<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Traffic steering (TS) is an important network function that distributes network traffic load across multiple transmission paths. It makes user equipment (UE) connected to the best serving base station (BS) and choose best bands when multiple BSs provide coverage in the same geographical area <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs), dual connectivity (DC) and mobility also increase the complexity of TS management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Therefore, how to manage network traffic efficiently has become a very challenging task for 5G beyond and 6G networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Conventional TS strategies are usually cell-centric, in which BSs make TS decisions for all the connected UEs. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed a centralized load-balancing algorithm to decide handovers by calculating an offset value for users in the same cluster. However, such strategies fail to consider the unique demand of heterogeneous UEs with different traffic types and quality of service (QoS) requirements. Additionally, the conventional centralized method may increase the computation burden on the central controller, and lead to privacy and security concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the traffic types diversify, UE-centric TS strategies have appeared and attracted more attention. In a UE-centric TS, each UE selects the appropriate RAT, cell and frequency band that best serves their need. Compared with conventional cell-centric methods, the UE-centric scheme indicates that each UE can make its decision using local observations and experience, and then submit it to the BS for coordination.
Hence, UE-centric networks with on-device intelligence have become a promising technique for TS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The benefits of designing a UE-centric network include:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(1) The UE-centric framework can mitigate the computation burden on the central controller because some computational tasks are transferred to the UEs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(2) The UE-centric framework enables better QoS for diverse UEs because each UE can customize its TS demand and submit local decisions to BSs for coordination.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(3) Compared with conventional cell-centric frameworks, UE-centric schemes can better preserve user privacy because some local observations of UE can be locally kept and will not be shared with the centralized controller.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, by leveraging on-device intelligence and offloading part of the processing computation to the UE side, the UE-centric TS framework also has better scalability compared to cell-centric TS. When the number of UE increases, the sum of on-device intelligence also increases. As a result, the framework is able to accommodate a very large number of UEs. Despite the potential benefits, UE-centric TS requires multiple distributed models rather than a single centralized model. The limited local observations of individual UE and coordination between multiple heterogeneous UEs lead to great complexity for the design and implementation. In addition, a single UE may have limited computational and energy resources for decision-making, increasing the difficulty of network management.
In recent years, machine learning (ML) technologies have been widely applied in wireless communications to provide automated solutions for high-complexity tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Especially, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms are proposed to deal with the increasing complexity of network environment. For instance, DRL has been used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to allocate physical resource blocks and control the power level of UEs, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> applies DRL for joint user association and CU–DU placement under the O-RAN architecture. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, DRL is applied to dynamic resource allocations for 5G networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are challenges in implementing UE-centric ML algorithms. Since each UE is considered an independent agent without direct information exchange with other UEs, it can only obtain limited information from local observations.
Moreover, decentralized models may take long iterations to adapt to environmental changes, leading to a relatively long exploration time and slow convergence. In addition, every time a new UE is admitted to the network, it must start learning from the beginning, and this will degrade the overall network performance. To this end, we adopt an attention-weighted federated learning technique and use a global server to coordinate local models. In particular, the decentralized UEs upload the parameters of their local models to the global server. According to the performance of local models, an attention weight is calculated for each UE using a sigmoid function. The global server aggregates the local models into a global model by calculating the attention weights of the local models. Then the global parameters will be returned to the local model as feedback for model updates. Compared with conventional federated learning, the attention mechanism can improve model aggregation and obtain a better global model. Considering the advantages of accelerated convergence, federated learning can be widely used in distributed learning-based network control applications such as distributed resource allocation and edge caching.

</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, in a dynamic network environment, existing users may leave the network, and new users will join the network without any intelligent experience. Then these inexperienced new users may degrade the system performance, since they have no knowledge of TS strategies.
To this end, a knowledge transfer approach is incorporated into the proposed framework. Specifically, knowledge acquired by existing users will be transferred to new users and give newcomers a good initialization for a quick start <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. It will reduce the training efforts of new users, and mitigate performance degradation caused by inexperienced new UEs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, considering the large size and complex structure of ML models in most cases, training ML algorithms are supposed to be computation-intensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. A UE may have limited computational resources for algorithm training and neural network updating, especially when running multiple applications simultaneously. Moreover, these computation-intensive tasks incur extra power consumption for the UE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. As a result, the deployed ML models are expected to be computationally resource-efficient. To address this issue, we proposed a growing and pruning-based model compression technique. By gradually splitting the most competitive neurons and eliminating the weakest neurons, we can estimate the smallest model size without degrading the TS performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, inspired by these benefits and challenges, we propose a knowledge transfer and federated learning-enabled UE-centric (KT-FLUC) TS framework in conjunction with the concept of on-device intelligence. Different from the conventional TS schemes, each UE can make individual TS strategies by training ML models on the UE side. Through this structural innovation, our proposed framework has advantages in scalability, performance, and privacy protection. The main contributions are:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">(1) We use several innovative techniques to solve the challenges of implementing UE-centric TS. We propose a unique transfer learning approach of providing expert q-values by building local expert models, which have been barely used in existing studies. We also combine grouping techniques and attention mechanisms with the conventional FL techniques to make it more suitable for our proposed scenario. We considered a time-
variant network in which new UEs may arrive and leave the network dynamically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">(2) We design a KT-FLUC framework for UE-centric TS. Different from existing frameworks that simply bring different techniques together, in the proposed framework, these innovative techniques are inter-playing and mutually enhancing each other as a whole. In this work, the transfer learning technique makes the level of training of participants in federated learning relatively consistent. This process facilitates the cooperation between participants and thus contributes to FL. On the other hand, federated learning provides a suitable expert model for transfer learning through global aggregation and opens up potential applications for transfer learning. Working in conjunction with each other, each of these technologies can be made more useful in the designated scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p">(3) We also propose a novel growing and pruning method to compress the DRL model and determine the optimal neural
network (NN) size for TS. In this method, the neuron number of hidden layers of each UE is firstly increased and then decreased. The network performance under different model sizes is recorded, and the optimal number of hidden neurons can be established according to the performance decay rate with varying degrees of model compression. This method can effectively reduce the computation burden and power consumption on devices. To perform model compression more efficiently, we also propose a novel neuron splitting method, and this is the first time we apply model compression to a wireless communication application.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">TS has been widely investigated under cell-centric frameworks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a centralized DRL framework is designed to decide the individual cell offset to control the handover of UEs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> studied how to offload a mobile UE from macro cells to small cells and derived optimal offloading strategies with resource partitioning. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a centralized radio access network (RAN) management module is designed to make TS decisions according to the traffic load of different RAT. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, a deep Q-network (DQN) is used to make traffic steering decisions with multiple RATs in a dynamic environment. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a load-aware traffic steering algorithm is performed based on centralized hierarchical reinforcement learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These studies demonstrate that cell-centric TS can improve network efficiency and average network performance. However, in most existing works, there will be considerable overhead between the centralized controller and distributed UE. The centralized controller must process a large amount of information which will lead to a heavy computation burden. On the other hand, in a centralized architecture, the information submitted by the UEs may contain private information, such as traffic profiles that may infer UE locations and so on. The data exchange between the UEs and the controller makes the system more vulnerable to eavesdropping or attacks. As a result, privacy and security concerns are involved. Moreover, most of these frameworks fail to provide individual TS strategies for each UE, which may not satisfy the varying requirements of different UEs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, some existing works investigate UE-centric frameworks with ML techniques. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> studies how to design a UE-centric network selection framework in ultra-dense heterogeneous networks by choosing the optimal RAT according to the link state prediction. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> provides a fully distributed TS approach running on distributed devices and optimizes each UE’s received signal strength and energy consumption. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, distributed UEs choose their cooperative BS according to the received signal interference noise ratio (SINR) and predicted load of BS. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> designed a UE-based distributed TS mechanism between Wi-Fi networks and LTE with Q-learning. Although the above works adopt UE-centric frameworks and some use ML techniques such as federated learning, our work differs from existing works in three aspects. Firstly, most existing works simply deploy models on the UE side and fail to consider the limited resource of UEs. As a result, they may impose extra computation burdens on devices. Secondly, the collaboration between decentralized UEs is rarely considered in previous works, leading to low efficiency when applying the algorithm in practice. In addition, these works consider a static network environment with a fixed number of users, which is unrealistic, but our work includes a dynamic environment where UEs may join and leave the network. This work combines the concepts of reinforcement learning, federated learning, knowledge transfer, and model compression for the first time, merging the advantages of different techniques to collaboratively set up a UE-centric framework for TS.</p>

Firstly, we apply the growing and pruning method to decide the optimal network size for the UR intelligence.
In particular, we first grow the NN size by adding neurons, then compress the NN size by pruning neurons.
Given the appropriate NN size, federated learning and knowledge transfer are cooperatively performed within a KU-FLUC framework. This framework uses an attention-weighted federated learning algorithm to aggregate experience from distributed UEs and generates a global model. A weight parameter is calculated for each UE by an attention model according to the performance of each UE. Then, UEs submit the parameters of their local models to the RAN controller, and the parameters of the global model are updated according to the local parameters and attention weights. After that, the knowledge transfer technique is used to transfer the aggregated experience from the global model to UEs. It is implemented by defining an expert model for each UE. The expert is a copy of the aggregated global model, which runs inside each UE. In the local training process of each UE, only local models are trained, and expert models remain unchanged. Every time the global model is updated, the parameters of expert models will also be updated by parameter replication, and the action selection is processed inside each UE according to the outputs of expert models and local models.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, for realistic dynamic environments, new UEs may join the network without prior knowledge of intelligent TS. Knowledge transfer will be performed between the global model and the newcomer for initialization. After that, the newcomer will perform local training and join the next round of federated learning.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This KT-FLUC framework uses federated learning to collect and aggregate experience from UEs with similar traffic types and QoS requirements. Knowledge transfer transfers the aggregated experience to existing UEs and newcomers. The expert model of knowledge transfer is obtained during federated learning, which is how these two techniques are connected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The update of the global model by federated learning is non-real-time, while the TS decisions made by UEs are real-time.
Under this framework, UEs may leave the system, but their experience will be kept for newcomers. The shared model is constantly updated with the distributed efforts of all the UEs in this network. Despite the high dynamics of the system, the knowledge learned by UEs consistently contributes to the optimization of a shared expert model. In turn, the expert model accelerates the local models’ training and enhances system performance.</p>

The number of queued packets is related to the QoS of the UE. The delay of the last arrived packet, and the current attached BS indicates whether the UE needs to switch to a new BS. These indicators are important for TS decisions and can easily be observed and collected from the view of a single UE.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As it can be observed from the MDP definition, the definition of reward has a similar format to the utility, which is the optimization goal of the problem formulation. The action is similar to the control variable of the problem formulation. By doing this, we convert the problem defined in Eq (<a href="#S3.E5" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ On-Device Intelligence for 5G RAN: Knowledge Transfer and Federated Learning enabled UE-Centric Traffic Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) into a MDP problem, which can then be solved with the DQN algorithm. The optimal gap of the solution is decided by the training effect of the DQN. In an ideal situation, the DQN is able to develop an optimal TS solution with full exploration and accurate prediction. However, it is very difficult for DQN to be trained to perfection in real cases. To reduce the optimal gap, in this work, we also use FL and transfer learning techniques to enhance the training effect of DQN. Also, to limit the number of handovers, the handover action will be selected only if the reward value differential is higher than a given threshold. In this way, the framework will avoid unnecessary handovers.</p>

Considering the heterogeneity between different traffic types, we assume UEs with GBR traffic as the first group and UEs with non-GBR traffic as the second group and enable model federating and experience sharing among groups. Inside each group, an attention weight is calculated and assigned to each UE to represent the contribution of each UE to the global model and promote model aggregation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The second step is attention weights determination. In each federating interval, all the UEs submit the parameters of their local DQN to the RAN controller to aggregate a global model. Weight parameters are calculated and assigned for each UE as preparation for aggregation. Since all the local models are trained separately and independently, they are trained at different degrees. To generate a more accurate and generalized global model, we expect well-trained models to contribute more to the global model. In contrast, barely trained models contribute less to the global model. Given this, three key indicators are used to evaluate how well the model has been trained, the average reward, training data size and the achievement rate.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section will introduce the growing and pruning method for model compression.
Based on biological neural theories, neurons compete with each other. The neurons with more substantial competitiveness are suitable for survival and growth while the neurons with weaker competitiveness will be eliminated<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the model compression can be divided into two phases, the growing phase and the pruning phase, shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Growing and Pruning-based Model Compression ‣ IV Proposed TS Scheme ‣ On-Device Intelligence for 5G RAN: Knowledge Transfer and Federated Learning enabled UE-Centric Traffic Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Growing and Pruning-based Model Compression ‣ IV Proposed TS Scheme ‣ On-Device Intelligence for 5G RAN: Knowledge Transfer and Federated Learning enabled UE-Centric Traffic Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, a growing phase is first performed to estimate how many neurons will be enough to support the network functions. It is worth explaining that although UEs are resource-constrained, the growing process is designed before our real implementation and does not have to be run online on UE devices. So the constrained resources will not be a problem. During the growing phase, the number of neurons is added one by one by splitting the neuron with the strongest competitiveness into two. If no improvement is observed in the network performance as the model size increases, the NN is supposed to be large enough to support the network functions. Then the algorithm steps into the pruning process and the neurons are pruned one by one by cutting off the neuron with the weakest competitiveness until there are no more neurons to be cut off.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">This section introduces the transfer learning technique. The framework of knowledge transfer is shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-D Q-value-based Knowledge Transfer ‣ IV Proposed TS Scheme ‣ On-Device Intelligence for 5G RAN: Knowledge Transfer and Federated Learning enabled UE-Centric Traffic Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. We define two models for each UE, an expert model and a local model. During the TS process, both the expert and local models of a UE observe the state from the environment and generate Q-vales for different actions. The expert model is initialized by the global model in the RAN controller through parameter replication. Although expert models share the same network parameters with the global model, they are different models because they are deployed at different parts of the network and play different roles. The expert model is deployed inside each UE. It takes the previously learned knowledge of the global model as expert knowledge and provides expert Q-values based on the global experience during local training process in federated learning. The local model provides local Q-values based on the local experience. The TS actions are chosen by maximizing the sum of expert and local Q-values. This process can be formulated as:</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When a new UE arrives at the system, the global model parameters are directly copied into the local and expert models for initialization. Next, during each federated interval, the actions are chosen as a combined effort of both the local and expert models. We use separated local models and expert models since the local model is trained and updated during local training, while the global model remains unchanged. When federated learning is performed, the global model is updated by federating all the local models. The updated global model is used to update the expert models at each UE side. Therefore, the global experience and local experience can be simultaneously learned but separately kept at each UE. Another advantage of using the proposed knowledge transfer scheme is that it can reduce the running time by performing global model aggregation and local training simultaneously. Conventionally, the local model update is based on feedback from the global model, so local training and model aggregation should be performed sequentially. But with the introduction of the expert model, feedback is given to the expert model instead of the local model. That means UEs do not need to wait for feedback from the global model and model aggregation can be run in parallel with local training. In this way, the running time of model aggregation is saved.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">With this definition, the sum of expert Q-values and local Q-values is supposed to converge to twice the long-term accumulated reward. On the other hand, expert Q-values and local Q-values will converge to a similar value according to the federated learning process. So the final output is expected to converge to the long-term accumulated reward of given actions and states. In this way, expert models can provide a lead for UEs according to the previous experience of other UEs and UEs can make personalized modifications based on the suggestions of experts. It is worth pointing out that the expert models do not need to be trained on the UE side. It is only used for model inference during the local training, which only requires minimum computation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed four baseline algorithms. Firstly, we compared our proposed KT-FLUC algorithm with a centralized cell-centric DRL-based TS algorithm (CL), which is implemented based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In this algorithm, we only use a single agent at the RAN controller, collecting observations from distributed UEs and making a centralized decision. The action is a joint TS decision of all the UEs, which will be broken into independent TS actions for each UE, and the model will be trained based on the average reward of all the UEs. The critical steps of the CL algorithm are summarized at Algorithm <a href="#alg6" title="Algorithm 6 ‣ IV-E Baselines ‣ IV Proposed TS Scheme ‣ On-Device Intelligence for 5G RAN: Knowledge Transfer and Federated Learning enabled UE-Centric Traffic Steering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, these analyses show that the computational complexity of local training is proportional to the number of neurons. In practical implementation, the UE usually has limited memory and computation capacity, while it will take them significant processing of network parameters to perform applications deployed on to them<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The growth of NN will have a critical impact on energy, power, and timing. So it is necessary to limit the NN size. In this paper, we have kept the number of neurons as low as possible through neural network compression to save the computation cost of local training. The complexity of global updates is proportional to the number of UEs and the number of neurons. Although the complexity will increase when the number of UE increases, the global server is usually assumed to be powerful enough to deal with the high computational complexity. On the other hand, the global model aggregation is a non-real-time process, so it will not be computationally demanding. Therefore, the system has good scalability and can still work well when there are a large number of UEs.</p>

It can be observed that the CL algorithm can achieve a higher system reward than the DIL algorithm, but a lower reward than our proposed KT-FLUC algorithm. This demonstrates that the cell-based algorithm has an advantage in system performance compared with simple UE-centric algorithms because the cell-centric algorithms hold more comprehensive information and can coordinate between UEs.</p>

As the number of UE increases, the competition for resources among UEs becomes more intense, so the average delay will increase, and the average throughput will decrease. It can be observed that the CL algorithm performs better when there are fewer UEs. In contrast, UE-centric algorithms are influenced less by the increase in the number of UEs. This is because fewer UEs are easier to coordinate, and there is less information for the centralized model to deal with. When the average UE number is 25, the CL algorithm can achieve 14% higher throughput compared with the proposed KT-FLUC algorithm. However when the average UE number is 65, the proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can achieve 52% higher throughput than the CL algorithm. It can be observed that the delay of the CL algorithm is the highest among the three algorithms. This is because the cell-based algorithm tends to focus more on the overall performance of a cell rather than on the individual performance of UEs. Since the proportion of non-GBR traffic is much higher than GBR traffic, the CL algorithm may make decisions that are more suitable for non-GBR traffic at the expense of the benefits of GBR traffic to guarantee the overall reward. In comparison, in UE-centric algorithms, each UE fights for its own rewards, so it will choose the most appropriate actions for itself and makes the delay lower.
When the average UE number is 65, the proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can achieve a 65% lower delay than the CL algorithm.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To further compare the cell-centric TS and UE-centric TS, we define three indicators to measure the UE’s satisfaction with the TS service, traffic blocking, QoS violation rate and the transmission cycle. Since GBR traffic has a higher priority than non-GBR traffic, non-GBR traffic may be blocked when two kinds of traffic request transmission simultaneously. The traffic blocking represents the probability of GBR traffic being blocked. QoS violation rate represents the probability that the delay of GBR traffic exceeds the QoS requirements.

It can be observed that the DIL algorithm achieves the lowest system reward among the four algorithms. Furthermore, the DIL curves are oscillating and unstable, with large fluctuation intervals. In comparison, the FL algorithms can achieve higher system reward, and the FL curves are smoother. This is because in the DIL algorithm, there is no experience sharing between UEs and some UEs need to spend more time exploring and trying non-optimal actions. UEs may choose some bad actions during the exploration process, thus causing large fluctuations in the network performance and the reward value. Compared with the FL algorithm, the FLI algorithm can achieve higher system reward. This is because the parameter initialization from the expert model to newcomers can help them start faster. Also, newcomers may contribute lousy experience to the global model which will interfere with the experience sharing if they fail to learn practical experience before the federated learning process. The initialization can prevent users from contributing lousy experience, so it will help enhance the system performance. This can demonstrate that in addition to the regular role in federated learning, the global model can also play an additional role as an expert model for transfer learning. Finally, it can be observed that our proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can achieve the highest system reward, lowest delay, and highest throughput. This verifies that the proposed knowledge transfer algorithm performs better than copying parameters directly. The combination of federated learning and knowledge transfer can further improve system performance compared with federated learning.</p>

This is because GBR traffic has a higher priority than non-GBR traffic, demonstrating that the traffic has been directed more effectively. In summary, the proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can consistently achieve the lowest packet delay and the highest throughput with different UE numbers. When the average UE number is 45, the proposed KT-FLUC algorithm can achieve 24% lower delay and 43% higher throughput compared with DIL algorithm. Also, with the proposed knowledge transfer scheme, it can achieve 10% lower delay and 10% higher throughput compared with FLI algorithm.</p>

It can be observed that the knowledge transfer time of FLI is larger than KT-FLUC since the expert model will cause additional computational workload. However, the parallel running method used by KT-FLUC can efficiently reduce the federated learning time and total running time of the framework. Although extra calculation steps are introduced in KT-FLUC, it can still reduce the total running by 10%.</p>

In the beginning, the system is in a growing phase, and the neuron number of hidden layers increases with time.

Then during the 1800 - 2700 TTIs, a stabilization of the increase in reward is observed which is marked by an
ellipse and arrow in the figure. The stabilization indicates that model training has begun to converge, and the current model size is large enough to support the TS application.

<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At the beginning of the pruning process, the reward keeps stable as neurons with weaker competitiveness are pruned. This trend validates the theory that less competitive neurons have less influence on the output and demonstrates the possibility of reducing the number of hidden neurons without affecting the system performance to realize model compression. After about 8000 TTIs, there is a noticeable drop in the reward, meaning the corresponding model size is not large enough to support the given network function. The system performance will be influenced if we continuously compress the system model by pruning neurons. Therefore, by observing the reward during the pruning process, we can find a threshold as the maximum compression achievable without compromising system performance.</p>

It can be observed that when the neuron number is larger than 40, few decays can be observed in the system performance of all three scenarios with effectiveness above 90%. On the other hand, when the neuron number is less than 40, the effectiveness of models has declined significantly to varying degrees. So we conclude that 40 neurons is the threshold value for the compressed model size and the corresponding compression rate, 1.5, is the maximum compression rate achievable without compromising performance. In this situation, there will be 80 network parameters need to be submitted during federated learning, and if there are 50 UEs, the size of information to be exchanged is about 8 KB. Considering that at the initial pruning phase, the neurons of two hidden layers are evenly pruned, we keep the two-fold relationship of neuron numbers of two hidden layers and use 14 and 28 neurons at each layer as our model size for following TS simulations.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning is a promising solution for optimizing wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a federated transfer reinforcement learning-enabled UE-centric TS framework with knowledge transfer and model compression. The core idea is to use federated learning to aggregate decentralized local models, generate a robust global model, and use knowledge transfer to initialize newcomers. The simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves better convergence, stability, higher system throughput and lower delay compared with independent UE-centric TS and cell-centric TS. Considering these benefits, our proposed framework is not limited to TS. It can also be applied to other distributed wireless applications, such as edge caching and sleep control.
In the future, we plan to extend UE-centric wireless networks to other applications.
