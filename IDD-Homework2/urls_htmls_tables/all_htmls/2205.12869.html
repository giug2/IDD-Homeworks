<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">We consider federated edge learning (FEEL) among mobile devices that harvest the required energy from their surroundings, and share their updates with the parameter server (PS) through a shared wireless channel. In particular, we consider energy harvesting FL with over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, where the participating devices perform local computations and wireless transmission only when they have the required energy available, and transmit the local updates simultaneously over the same channel bandwidth. In order to prevent bias among heterogeneous devices, we utilize a weighted averaging with respect to their latest energy arrivals and data cardinalities. We provide a convergence analysis and carry out numerical experiments with different energy arrival profiles, which show that even though the proposed scheme is robust against devices with heterogeneous energy arrivals in error-free scenarios, we observe a 5-10% performance loss in energy harvesting OTA FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Developments in Internet-of-things (IoT) devices have helped machine learning (ML) approaches to be used in many domains such as healthcare, automation, and forecasting, thanks to its endless data collection. While mobile devices are at the center of attention for collecting data, traditional ML approaches require the collected data to be assembled in a cloud server for model training. However, this approach may not be feasible due to several reasons. Firstly, the participants are typically reluctant to share their private data; secondly, sending all the data to a server has a high communication cost, particularly in bandwidth and energy-limited scenarios. Finally, latency can be a critical limitation for time-sensitive applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</span> (FL) is a recently emerging framework that aims to mitigate these issues, where the participating devices perform model training with local data and send their parameter updates to the parameter server (PS), which orchestrates the learning process, instead of sharing the local data itself to preserve privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, participating devices called mobile devices (MDs) can be selected based on their available energy, computing capability, and channel quality to the PS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Before the local training, the global model is sent by the PS to the MDs. Selected MDs perform stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterations using their local dataset. After completion, a subset of the MDs shares their model updates with the PS, where the model aggregation is performed to obtain the updated global model. These steps are repeated either for a prescribed number of iterations or until a certain condition is met. Recent studies on FL include investigating the effects of data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, design of communication-efficient approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and latency and power analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Even though FL has many potential benefits in terms of privacy and communication cost, bandwidth limitations and adverse channel conditions in wireless setups may threaten its feasibility in certain practical scenarios. To reduce the required bandwidth in FEEL, over-the-air (OTA) aggregation has become the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">de facto</span> approach where the same bandwidth is shared by all the participating MDs, enabling the aggregation of gradients during the transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The adverse channel effects can be alleviated using multiple receive antennas and combining techniques at the PS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the success of FL in practical scenarios, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of MDs for training and sharing their local models create serious concerns about the sustainability of future smart systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. As a more sustainable approach, energy harvesting devices, which can acquire energy from their surroundings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, have been widely considered for mobile networks. These devices are typically equipped with a rechargeable battery to store the harvested energy, and perform the required computations and communications if they have available energy in their battery.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Energy harvesting communication devices have been previously studied in detail from different perspectives, including optimal transmission policies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and channel capacity computation for unit-sized battery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Energy harvesting FL has also been considered where the participating MDs are energy harvesting devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, no approach considers the wireless channel effects and OTA aggregation in energy harvesting FL setups, which constitutes the basis of this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To examine the performance of energy harvesting FL in a practical setting, we introduce energy harvesting OTA FL where the participating MDs perform their local SGD iterations and transmit their gradients using the wireless links whenever enough energy is available. Using OTA aggregation and combining techniques, the PS updates the global model based on the received signal. The updated model is sent back to the devices for the next global iteration. We compare the performance of our setup with the error-free scenarios and conventional FL using different energy arrival profiles. Numerical and experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can perform well under practical channel scenarios with convergence guarantees.</p>

The results show that the energy harvesting FL with error-free links has a convergence rate close to that of FL with full participation, and that adding a normalization term with respect to the cooldown multipliers leads to a faster convergence and less fluctuations compared to the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Moreover, OTA FL perform very similar to the scenario used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> with error-free links. It can be seen that even though the links are wireless, the gap in the performance can be compensated as the number of global iterations increases. One reason is that the increased number of receive antennas at the PS can reduce the adverse affects of the small-scale fading and noise.

It can also be observed that the performance of Bernoulli arrivals is very close to the that of the uniform arrivals due to the similarities in the energy arrival profiles.</p>

We observe a close convergence rate between the conventional FL and the error-free energy harvesting FL as expected due to weighted averaging operation with respect to the cooldown multipliers. Energy harvesting FL with OTA aggregation has a slower convergence rate when compared to the others because of the wireless channel as well as the decreased number of participants at each iteration due to energy harvesting devices.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We study OTA FL with energy harvesting devices with intermittent and heterogeneous energy arrivals. Our framework consists of local SGD computations at the MDs that have available energy, and OTA aggregation of the gradients over a shared wireless medium. The convergence rate of FL with energy harvesting devices are examined and its performance is analyzed through numerical experiments. The results with different energy profiles demonstrate that performing a weighted averaging using the latest energy arrival and dataset cardinality in energy harvesting FL can give a similar performance to the full-participation scheme in both error-free and OTA cases. As a future direction, one can investigate different battery capacities, and try to optimize how much power should be allocated for computation and transmission.</p>
