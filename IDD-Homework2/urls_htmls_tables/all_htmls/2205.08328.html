<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With its privacy preservation and communication efficiency, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising learning framework for beyond 5G wireless networks. It is anticipated that future wireless networks will jointly serve both FL and downlink non-FL user groups in the same time-frequency resource. While in the downlink of each FL iteration, both groups jointly receive data from the base station in the same time-frequency resource, the uplink of each FL iteration requires bidirectional communication to support uplink transmission for FL users and downlink transmission for non-FL users. To overcome this challenge, we present half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) communication schemes to serve both groups. More specifically, we adopt the massive multiple-input multiple-output technology and aim to maximize the minimum effective rate of non-FL users under a quality of service (QoS) latency constraint for FL users. Since the formulated problem is highly nonconvex, we propose a power control algorithm based on successive convex approximation to find a stationary solution. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions perform significantly better than the considered baselines schemes. Moreover, the FD-based scheme outperforms the HD-based scheme in scenarios where the self-interference is small or moderate and/or the size of FL model updates is large.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The use of mobile phones and wearable devices enables continuous collection and transfer of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which has been the main driving force behind the explosive increase in data mobile traffic in recent years. Also, due to a constant growing interest in new features and tools, the computational power of these devices is increasing day by day. Thus, in many applications, part of data processing is carried out at user’s wireless devices. In this context, questions over the transmission of private information over wireless networks naturally arise. To preserve data privacy, a potential solution is to store the data on local servers and move network computation to the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In fact, data privacy has drawn significant interest in developing new machine learning techniques that can ensure data privacy and exploit the computational resources of users at the same time. One such a promising technique is knowns as <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Learning</em> (FL) which was first introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. FL is a decentralized form of machine learning that allows edge devices to learn from a shared prediction model and to keep the data samples on device without exchanging them. Due to this data privacy attribute, FL has been used in a wide range of real-world digital applications e.g., Gboard, FedVision, functional MRI, FedHealth, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL has also gained growing attention from the wireless communications research community recently due to its privacy protection and resource utilization features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, mainly from the viewpoint of implementing FL over wireless networks.
These pioneer studies can be classified as “learning-oriented” or
“communication-oriented”. The learning-oriented category aims to improve the learning performance (e.g., training loss, test accuracy) subject to inherent factors in wireless networks such as thermal noise, fading, and estimation errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, Chen <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> considered user selection to minimize the FL training loss function under the presence of network constraints. Amiri <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> optimized the test accuracy to schedule devices and allocate power across time slots. The communication-oriented category, on the other hand, focuses on enhancing the communication performance (e.g., training latency, energy efficiency) in the framework of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, Yang <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> considered the problem of minimization of the total energy consumption to train the FL model under a latency constraint. Vu <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> focused on minimizing the training latency under transmit power and data rate constraints. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, Tran <em id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> investigated the problem of optimizing the computation and communication latencies of mobile devices subject to various trade-offs between the energy consumption, learning time, and learning accuracy parameters. All above-mentioned works take into account serving only FL users (UEs). However, it is certain that future wireless networks will need to serve both the FL and non-FL UEs and thus if FL is to be realized, which calls for novel communication designs. We address this fundamental problem in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The main challenge in jointly serving FL and non-FL UEs is that it requires both the uplink and downlink transmission between UEs and the central server occur simultaneously, which has not yet been studied in the existing literature. To understand this, let us briefly describe a communication round of an FL iteration in the presence of only FL UEs, which consists of four steps: (i) The central server transmits the global update of an ML model to FL UEs; (ii) FL UEs calculate their local model updates based on their local data set; (iii) The local model updates are sent back to the central server; and (iv) The central server calculates the global update by aggregating the received local model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. It is clear that problems arise when there are non-FL UEs that need to be served in the downlink. First and most importantly,
in Step (iii), the base station needs to set up a two-way communication channel to implement the uplink of FL UEs and the downlink of non-FL UEs.
Second, efficient resource allocation approaches are required at all the steps to control the inter-user interference among FL UEs and non-FL UEs to satisfy their different service requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are two types of communication schemes that are possible to serve the two-way communication between the central server and UEs, namely half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD). Each of these communication schemes has its own advantages and disadvantages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The main draw back of the FD scheme is the self-interference (SI) between transmit and receive antennas of the BS can cause significant performance degradation, which does not appear in the HD communication. However, for small or moderate SI, the FD communication can approximately double the spectral efficiency compared to the half duplex (HD) scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Both HD and FD schemes are popular in the literature of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, they cannot be straightforwardly applied to the massive MIMO systems that serve both FL and non-FL UEs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we follow the communication-oriented approach and propose a novel network design for jointly serving FL and downlink non-FL UEs<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The network design for uplink non-FL UEs is open for future works.</span></span></span>
at the same time. First, we propose a communication scheme using massive MIMO and let each FL communication round be executed in one large-scale coherence time.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Large-scale coherence time is a time interval where the large-scale
fading coefficient remains reasonably invariant.</span></span></span> Because of the high array gain, multiplexing gain, and macro-diversity gain, massive MIMO provides a reliable operation of each FL communication round as well as the whole FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Here, in the first step of each
FL communication round, both groups are jointly served in the downlink by the central server and in the third step, either of the HD and FD schemes is considered to serve the uplink transmission of FL UEs and the downlink transmission of non-FL UEs. Next, we formulate an optimization problem that optimally allocates power and computation resources to maximize the fairness of effective data rates for non-FL UEs, while ensuring a quality-of-service time of each FL iteration for FL UEs. A successive convex approximation algorithm is then proposed to solve the formulated problem.
In particular, our contributions are as follows:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose HD and FD communication schemes to jointly serve both FL and non-FL UEs in a massive MIMO network, which has not been studied previously. In the proposed HD scheme, the total system bandwidth is divided equally between the FL and non-FL groups in the uplink of each FL iteration such that both groups are served at the same time in different bandwidths. In the FD communication scheme, both FL UEs and non-FL UEs transmit and receive data in the same time and bandwidth resource under the presence of SI.</p>

Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum effective data subject to a QoS constraint on the execution time for FL UEs.

It is observed that the proposed HD and FD schemes provide significantly better solution than two considered baseline schemes. Numerical results also show that the FD scheme is a better choice than the HD scheme when the size of the model updates is large and/or when the SI is small or moderate.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In Step (S3), we need to serve both FL and non-FL UEs. In this regard, there are two types of possible communication schemes: HD and FD. In the HD scheme, the FL and non-FL groups are served in different frequency bands, while in the FD scheme, both groups are served in the same time and frequency resource.
During Step (S4), the BS computes its global update after receiving all the local update, the delay of computing the global update is negligible since the computational capability of the central server is much more powerful than those of the UEs. Therefore, the downlink amount of data received by the non-FL UEs during the fourth step is not considered in the rest of the paper.</p>

We assume that each FL iteration is executed within a large-scale coherence time. All the FL UEs start each step of
their FL iterations at the same time, and wait for others to finish
their steps before starting a new step. The global and local updates in Steps
(S1) and (S3) are transmitted in multiple (small-scale)
coherence interval, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-B Proposed Transmission Schemes ‣ II System Model and Proposed Transmission Scheme ‣ Massive MIMO for Serving Federated Learning and Non-Federated Learning Users" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b).
Each small-scale coherence interval in Step (S1) or (S3) includes two phases: channel estimation and downlink or uplink transmission. In the following, we will provide details of our proposed transmission protocol for both HD and HD modes at the BS in Step (S3).</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Step (S3) involves transmission in both directions. This motivates us to consider the FD communications to serve both
groups of UEs simultaneously. Specifically, FL UEs send
their local updates to the BS in the uplink channel and at the same
time, non-FL UEs receive the downlink data from the BS. The proposed FD scheme is detailed in what follows.</p>

coefficients are estimated similarly to what was done in case of the
HD communications. FL UEs transmit the locally computed updates to
the BS in the presence of non-FL UEs which are receiving the downlink
data. Therefore, SI is present between the receiver

In Step (S3), the uplink transmission for the FL group and the downlink of the non-FL group are executed using a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) approach for transmission. In particular, we divide the frequency band into all UEs such that each FL UE or non-FL UE has one single bandwidth slot for its transmission. This FDMA scheme is widely used in FL literature (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>).
The uplink and downlink rates of FL UEs in <span id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BL1</span> are derived in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Achievable Rates and Data Received for Baseline 1 (BL1) Scheme ‣ Massive MIMO for Serving Federated Learning and Non-Federated Learning Users" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>.
The optimization problem of <span id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BL1</span> has the same mathematical structure as that of the proposed scheme. Therefore, it can be solved by slightly modifying Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ III-B2 Solution for HD Scheme ‣ III-B HD Scheme ‣ III Problem Formulation and Proposed Solution ‣ Massive MIMO for Serving Federated Learning and Non-Federated Learning Users" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> using the same approximations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It can be observed that both algorithms converge in less than 30 iterations for both channel realizations. Further, we note that for both channels, FD-based solution provides a better objective than the HD-based solution.</p>

As seen clearly, both proposed schemes offer a better performance than the baseline counterparts.
The figures not only demonstrate the significant advantage of a joint allocation of power and computing frequency over the heuristic scheme <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BL2</span>, but also show the benefit of using massive MIMO. Thanks to massive MIMO technology, the data rate of each non-FL UE increases when the number of antennas increases, which then leads to a significant increase in the minimum effective data rates.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented two communication schemes that can support both the FL
and non-FL UEs using a massive MIMO technology which has not been considered previously. In particular, we have defined and maximize the effective rate of downlink
non-FL UEs in presence of a QoS latency constraint on FL UEs. We have also presented the HD and FD based solutions to the considered problem, specifically during the uplink of each FL iteration where the uplink FL UEs and downlink non-FL UEs receive their corresponding data simultaneously. In the downlink of each FL iteration, both FL and non-FL UEs continue to be served in the same time-frequency resource.
The simulation results have showed that
the proposed HD-based and FD-based schemes outperform the considered baseline schemes in all considered scenarios. It has also been shown that the FD-based scheme is superior to the HD-based scheme for the SI of upto <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="70" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">70</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">70</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">70</annotation></semantics></math> dB. The FD-based scheme is also more beneficial than the HD-based scheme in terms of th effective rate achieved by the non-FL UEs in the cases of large sizes of the model updates.</p>
