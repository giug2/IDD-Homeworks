<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">U-shaped networks are widely used in various medical image tasks, such as segmentation, restoration and reconstruction. Most of them usually rely on centralized learning and thus ignore privacy issues. To address privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) have attracted increasing attention. However, it is hard for both FL and SL to balance the local computational cost, model privacy and parallel training simultaneously. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ro</span>bust <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>plit <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">F</span>ederated <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">L</span>earning (<span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RoS-FL</span>) for U-shaped medical image networks, which is a novel hybrid learning paradigm of FL and SL. To preserve data privacy, including the input, model parameters, label and output simultaneously, we propose to split the network into three parts hosted by different parties. Besides, distributed learning methods usually suffer from a drift between local and global models caused by data heterogeneity.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decade, U-shaped medical image networks have achieved great success in various medical image tasks, such as segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, restoration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> etc. These methods require numerous data to train a network model. However, it is difficult to collect a large amount of data in a single institution in realistic scenario. Meanwhile, gathering data from multiple sources is hindered by several data protection regulations, especially for the privacy issues. To address this problem, distributed collaborative machine learning (DCML) has attracted increasing attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. It enables training a model in a decentralized manner without accessing the raw data from a single institution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a representative DCML paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> facilitates parallel training and their training time overhead is satisfactory. However, there are two challenges in FL: (1). <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The Requirement of Client computational resource</span>: Each client needs to train a full model, which requires high computational resources for each client. Hence, FL may be not suitable for computational resource-constrained environments. (2). <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Model Privacy</span>: All participants, including clients and the server, have full access to the whole model, which increases the potential privacy and security risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Split Learning (SL) was proposed to remedy FL’s shortcomings by splitting the full model into server-side and client-side models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The splitting operation has two advantages. First, clients only need to train a part of the model, and the most resource-consuming part is trained in the server. Second, each party, including clients and server, only partially accesses the full model. Hence, SL provides better model privacy and requires fewer client-side computational resources than FL. Despite the above merits, the main concern of SL is the training cost. The training process of SL is sequential, which only allows one client to engage with the server at one instance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Except for the above issues, data heterogeneity is an opening challenge for all DCML paradigms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This problem leads to a huge gap between the optimization directions of local and global models. For clients, local optimization attempts to find an optimal model for local data with a disinterest in global performance. global optimization expects to find a globally optimal solution, which has a certain tolerance for sub-optimal local performance. The different optimization goals will cause a drift between local and global models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To relieve the above problems in a unified framework, we propose <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ro</span>bust <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>plit <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">F</span>ederated <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">L</span>earning (<span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RoS-FL</span>) for U-shaped medical image networks. RoS-FL is a hybrid learning paradigm, which combines SL and FL and attempts to achieve the best of both worlds. We notice that, unlike classification task, the labels and outputs in segmentation, restoration and reconstruction tasks usually contain privacy information. To protect data privacy and reduce the computational costs in client side, we split the U-shaped network into three parts, including the head, body, and tail models. The proposed framework consists of three parts, which are computation server, aggregation server, and clients, respectively.
The head and tail models are hosted in clients, and the body part which requires large computational resource is hosted in computation server. To enable parallel training, each client corresponds to one body model in computation server. All clients perform the forward propagation of client-side models in parallel and upload the outputs of head models to computation server.
Body models are executed separately in parallel and transmit their outputs to the clients as the inputs of tail models.
The loss computation and back-propagation are independently performed in each client, and then the gradients of intermediate results are transferred to update the body and head models. After one communication round, client-side and server-side models are aggregated in the aggregation and computation servers, respectively.
It can be seen that the input, label and output are not transferred to other parties and each party only partially accesses the full model in the whole learning process. As a result, our method can effectively protect data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, to relieve the data heterogeneity problem, we propose a dynamic weight correction strategy (DWCS) to relieve the model drift problem and correct the global model. Specifically, a weight correction loss is designed to quantify the drift between models from two adjacent communication rounds, and the correction model is optimized by minimizing this loss. Then, we treat the weighted sum of the correction and last round models as the final corrected model. In early training, a large weight will be assigned to the model of current round, since the model is under-fitting. As the training continues, since the local training in the clients may lead to the model drift problem, a large weight for the correction model is necessary to recover from this dilemma and approach the global optimal solution. In summary, we expect to stabilize the training process for a robust model and the weights of the two models are dynamically tuned to avoid model drift.

The success of these methods demonstrates the effectiveness of U-shaped structure in medical segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

Zhang <span id="S2.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> evaluated the performance of split federated learning in several medical tasks. Since SFL transfers outputs or labels between different parties, violating the privacy setting, it is unsuitable for the widely used U-shaped networks for medical image segmentation and reconstruction. Besides, its other limitation is it suffers from the data heterogeneity problem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The learning processes of FL and SL are illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Problem Formulation ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Robust Split Federated Learning for U-shaped Medical Image Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. It can be observed that the optimization objectives of these two methods are different. FL expects an optimal full network, but SL tries to optimize the different partition networks. Besides, SL can effectively protect the model privacy, and its local computational costs are low. However, the learning process of SL is sequential, leading to serious training time overhead and under-utilization of client computational resources. Compared with SL, FL can be implemented in a parallel way, but its clients need to train the full models locally, which requires high client-side computational resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Actually, SL and FL are complementary and the drawbacks of SL can be fixed by FL and vice-versa. The split operation in SL can reduce the client-side computational cost and protects the model privacy. The aggregation operation in FL can take full advantage of local computational resources and significantly lower the training time overhead. To enjoy the merits of both worlds, we propose a hybrid learning paradigm for U-shaped medical image networks. A similar idea
was also proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, but its splitting method is not suitable for segmentation, restoration, and reconstruction. The main reasons lie in that:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p5.7" class="ltx_p">The above problems motivate us to propose a split method without sharing the input, model parameters, output and label of different parties.

The lightweight head and tail networks are hosted in clients to reduce the local computational costs, and the computational resource-required body network is hosted in the server with high-performance computational resources.

Assuming that the connected encoder and decoder layers are hosted in different parties, the outputs of encoder layers must be uploaded to other party, which will increase the communication cost. In our method, the corresponding encoder and decoder layers are hosted in the same party, so there is no extra communication bandwidth for feature transfer.

So far, one backpropagation pass between clients and the server is completed. To make full use of all local data and get optimal global models, we aggregate the client-side and server-side models in the aggregation and computation servers, respectively. Until now, one complete global training round has been finished. It can be observed that the training processes of different clients are executed in parallel, which greatly reduce the training time overhead of SL. Meanwhile, there is no party in our framework can access the full model, which effectively protects model privacy. Then, the servers provide aggregated models by averaging local models as:</p>

As a result, it may generate a poor optimization solution to the global model and cause model collapse after aggregation. This problem happens more commonly in healthcare tasks, in which the collected data inevitably suffer from serious data heterogeneity caused by several factors, such as different hardware, scanning protocols and patients.</p>

Specifically, we treat the model of the last communication round as the anchor model and propose a weight correction loss to quantify the drift between the anchor model and its adjacent communication round model. Then we get the correction model by minimizing the weight correction loss, and the weighted sum of the correction and last round models is treated as the final result.

<p id="S3.SS4.p5.3" class="ltx_p">In the early stage of training, a small weight should be assigned to the correction model to accelerate convergence. With the training continuing, the model almost converges, but the local training may cause severe model drift, which leads to global model collapse by aggregating. To alleviate the above issue, inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, we propose a dynamic adjustment strategy to stabilize the training process and minish the model drift.

It can be noticed that the proposed RoS-FL is a parallel DCML method without sharing the input, model parameters, output and label. As a result, the model privacy can be well protected in the whole training phase. Additionally, we only need to perform DWCS once during one communication round, so our method is lighter than regularization-based methods.</p>

Our method accurately identifies the boundaries of organ regions, and significantly outperforms other methods. In the first case, our result is even better than CL. We must mention that FedMRI is proposed for MRI reconstruction, which is unsuitable for segmentation task.
In the ablation experiment, we find that DWCS can effectively improve the segmentation performance due to its good trade-off between the convergence acceleration and model drift recovery.</p>

Eight patients are randomly divided into four clients on average as the training dataset, and two patients are treated as testing dataset. To simulate real environments, we generate multi-source non-iid low-dose CT (LDCT) data following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The quantitative results are shown in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 4.3 Restoration Experiments ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust Split Federated Learning for U-shaped Medical Image Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. It can be noticed that our method achieves the best performance in comparison with other DCML methods, and even works better than CL in some clients. Similar to the segmentation task, FL-based methods are inferior to SL-based methods in most cases. The possible reason lies in that the transferred weights are only with limited information and they cannot make full use of the information from local data. However, as mentioned above, the training time overheads of FL-based methods are much less than those of SL-based methods. Our method combines the merits of both learning paradigms and achieves the best performance. In the ablation experiment about DWCS, we can easily find that it improves the overall performance. We can notice that the results of other methods in Client #1 have a significant performance gap with those in other clients, which is probably caused by the model drift problem. Benefiting from DWCS, which effectively alleviates the model drift problem by correcting the optimal solution, our method has no noticeable performance gap between different nodes.

It can be observed that results denoised by other methods still contain noise or artifacts to varying degrees, but our method can effectively remove them. In some results of other methods, edges are blurry and some tiny structures are wrongly restored. Compared with them, our method correctly restores those structural details and edges, and they are clearer in our results.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The domain shift problem between clients may cause the global model to deviate from the global optimal solution after aggregation. We conduct experiments to sense the impact of the number of local training epochs and communication rounds on the performance. For all the cases, we set the numbers of training iterations equal, and the results of segmentation and restoration tasks are shown in Tabs. <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 4.4 Ablation Experiments ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust Split Federated Learning for U-shaped Medical Image Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> and <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 4.3 Restoration Experiments ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust Split Federated Learning for U-shaped Medical Image Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, respectively. We notice that increasing the number of local training epochs would decrease the imaging performance, but the segmentation performance is not significantly affected. The domain gap in imaging task is greater than that in segmentation task since the scanner and scanning parameters may be different, which lead to a more serious model drift problem in imaging. The model drift is more serious as the number of local training epochs increases, which will lead the global model to deviate from the global optimal solution. As a result, we empirically decrease the number of local training epochs to avoid the above issues.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current U-shaped medical image networks have achieved impressive success without considering privacy issues. To simultaneously protect the data privacy of input, model parameters, output and label, we propose dynamic weight correction split federated learning (RoS-FL) for U-shaped medical image networks. Except for privacy protection, RoS-FL also has other important merits, such as low training time overhead and local computational resource. Meanwhile, we focus on the model drift problem in distributed learning, and propose dynamic weight correction strategy (DWCS) to correct the optimization solution and stabilize the training. Extensive experiments on different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the other side, although RoS-FL can achieve satisfactory performance on different domains, it ignores the test data belonging to an unseen domain. As a result, how to improve the performance for an unseen domain seems an interesting research field in our future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another issue we must mention is that although the proposed RoS-FL achieves promising performance, one concern for our method is the risk of reconstructing raw images from shared feature maps. Related risks can be prevented by integrating privacy protecting techniques, such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> and secure multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. Extending the proposed RoS-FL against inversion attacks by combining these technologies will be another possible research direction in the future.</p>
