<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Deploying ultra-dense networks that operate on millimeter wave (mmWave) band is a promising way to address the tremendous growth on mobile data traffic. However, one key challenge of ultra-dense mmWave network (UDmmN) is beam management due to the high propagation delay, limited beam coverage as well as numerous beams and users. In this paper, a novel systematic beam control scheme is presented to tackle the beam management problem which is difficult due to the non-convex objective function. We employ double deep Q-network (DDQN) under a federated learning (FL) framework to address the above optimization problem, and thereby fulfilling adaptive and intelligent beam management in UDmmN. In the proposed beam management scheme based on FL (BMFL), the non-raw-data aggregation can theoretically protect user privacy while reducing handoff cost. Moreover, we propose to adopt a data cleaning technique in the local model training for BMFL, with the aim to further strengthen the privacy protection of users while improving the learning convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of our proposed scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The past few years have witnessed the explosive growth of wireless data traffic, and this growth trend will continue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> due to the fast development of mobile multimedia applications and Internet of Things. With beamforming and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has been widely acknowledged as a promising means to meet the projected requirements by dint of the abundant spectrum resources. However, compared with the traditional microwave communication networks, mmWave communication networks face two critical challenges. One is the limited coverage because of the serious propagation path loss. Ultra-dense network (UDN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is an effective technique to address this issue, where various small cell base stations (SBSs) with different coverage are densely deployed, and thus the distance between users and SBSs becomes closer. The other is the susceptible to blockage due to the inherent directivity. An efficient strategy for enabling reliable transmissions and enhanced data rates is to employ the multi-connectivity technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which enables a user to connect to several SBSs simultaneously. In recent years, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has also become a powerful means to overcome this plight. Meanwhile, heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have been treated as one promising candidate for universal coverage and enhancing overall capacity, where SBSs are deployed underlying a core macro network. Inspired by these research results, we consider ultra-dense mmWave HetNets with multi-connectivity in this study, and focus on the issue of beam management since it affects the system performance principally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to hardware constraints, each mmWave SBS (mSBS) may only support limited beams simultaneously. However, for an ultra-dense mmWave system, the number of operating beams could be extremely large caused by the densely deployed mSBSs. This leads to a more complex and critical beam management problem than that in conventional non-dense mmWave systems. In current mmWave systems, the term beam management is usually known as fine alignment of the transmitter and receiver beams to perform a variety of control tasks including initial access for idle users and beam tracking for connected users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In this work, in order to improve beam utilization and reduce inter-beam interference, we manage beams in a systematic manner instead of beam-by-beam basis. The systematic beam management mainly refers to the dynamic control of beam directions at the mSBS side (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, mSBS beam configuration) based on periodically sensing instantaneous user distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we introduce machine learning (ML) technique to realize intelligent and proactive beam management. Although the existing ML-based mechanisms bring a number of benefits in beam management, they also expose some potential risks, most typically, in security and privacy protection. It is because that traditional centralized ML techniques normally require data collection and processing by a central controller, but the training data may be privacy sensitive in nature. This problem is becoming a bottleneck of large-scale implementation of traditional centralized ML schemes in practical applications. In addition, the overhead caused by centralized data aggregation and processing is usually significant. These reasons have led to a growing interest in a new ML model, namely federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In FL, participating learners collaboratively train a shared model by exploiting their local computation capability and data, and thus only local model updates instead of raw data need to be transferred to a centralized model aggregation server. Thereby, FL can be exploited to train ML models in a distributed way while preserving user privacy. These natures of FL motivate this work, which is the first time to exploit FL for designing mmWave beam management scheme in the open literature. Unfortunately, there are numerous mobile users in ultra-dense mmWave networks and the computing resources occupied for training on a specific mSBS may be inadequate. Hence, directly applying legacy FL framework to solve the the systematic beam management problem may not always effective and obtain satisfactory performance. In this paper, before model training, mSBSs will clean the training data according to actual demand, so as to ensure the privacy of specific users while improving the training efficiency.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have provided overview of beam management for mmWave in 5G New Radio standard. Beam management procedures for handling mobility can be categorized into beam sweeping, beam measurement and reporting, beam determination, beam maintenance, and beam failure recovery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. To date, most of the investigations in beam management tackle the problem by resorting to beam training, sparse channel estimation, and location aided beamforming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, while beam training is most commonly used. In beam training, both ends of a link search through the set of available beams in either an exhaustive or iterative mode until a good link is established. In particular, a fixed sector-level beam training is specified in IEEE 802.11ad/ay for initial access <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. A <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sector</em> is defined as a specific broad antenna radiation pattern. For mobile users, the beam training procedure should be performed frequently to ensure the accurate acquisition of the channel state information (CSI). But there exist a number of problems for this process, including high complexity, significant training overhead, and access delays. Motivated by this, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> investigated the challenges and potential solutions of
downlink beamspace SU-/MU-MIMO including multi-beam training, cooperative beam tracking, and multi-beam power allocation. To solve the problem of co-channel interference in dense mSBS scenario, a large-scale CSI-based interference coordination approach is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To improve the training efficiency especially in dynamic environments, the priori-aided beam training termed beam/channel tracking in the literatures is of crucial importance for users to maintain seamless connectivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, beam training/tracking is generally used to ensure a specific user’s quality of service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, for most practical scenarios, the assumption of mmWave channel modeling required by channel tracking techniques is too stringent to meet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As mobile environments are increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and evolving, ML techniques have attracted significant attention to optimize wireless communication systems in the last few years, owning to its ability in creating smart systems that can take sequential decisions and make accurate predictions. Prior work has established that ML is a good tool for beam management in mmWave communication systems, especially in mobile applications or dynamic environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. For example, a deep learning based coordinated beamforming algorithm is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to reduce the training overhead. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a deep neural network (DNN)-based beam management and interference coordination algorithm to reduce the interference and improve the sum-rate of dense mmWave network. In our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, a deep Q-network based user-centric association scheme is designed to provide reliable connectivity and high achievable data rate for ultra-dense mmWave networks. Furthermore, some work as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> uses FL to address their corresponding research issues. Intuitively, FL framework can further enhance the performance of the adaptive beam management scheme in terms of security and privacy protection, but the relevant topic is still in the exploratory research stage.</p>

In order to communicate and exchange control information, the MBS and mSBSs are inter-connected via traditional backhaul X2 interfaces. Meanwhile, multi-connectivity, which is a feature that each user maintains multiple possible signal links to different cells, is introduced to improve the robustness of mmWave communications. Due to the short distance and high directivity of mmWave transmission, a full reuse of mmWave spectrum usually does not suffer from serious interference. Hence, we assume that all mSBSs share the total mmWave bandwidth <math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{mm}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">W</mi><mrow id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">m</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑊</ci><apply id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑚</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">W_{mm}</annotation></semantics></math>.

We assume that the beams covering different sectors are mutually orthogonal in space, and each beam can serve multiple users within its coverage, for example, in a time division multiplexing manner. Different from traditional beam management, which is used to maximize the quality of a single link through beam training and tracking, the beam management in this paper aims to maximize the system level performance through the beam configuration on the mSBS side. In order to improve beam utilization, beam management leveraging double deep Q-network (DDQN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> under an FL framework is used in our work. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II System Model ‣ Beam Management in Ultra-dense mmWave Network via Federated Reinforcement Learning: An Intelligent and Secure Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we assume that beam management is performed in a synchronous time-slotted fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and the beams are static during each time slot. A time slot here is defined as a beam adjustment interval, the duration of which is generally related to user mobility and sector range. Within each slot, there are three main operations. (i) At the beginning of a slot, mSBSs calculate the accumulated network performance over previous slots, and then manage beams by adopting FL-based algorithm. (ii) Users choose suitable mSBSs to associate with. (iii) Transmit data at the selected beam/mSBS.</p>

For the UDmmN, we focus on mmWave association instead of the association with the MBS, as the user association problem in conventional microwave communication networks has been studied extensively. We assume that users in the UDmmN are always associated with the MBS to ensure seamless communication. To ensure the QoS requirements of users, the mmWave association is carried out after the beam configuration.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Examining problem <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> we realize that the problem is hard to solve by using traditional optimization method. The rational behind is that the long-term optimization objective with unknown user movement behavior is formulated. Thus, the network environment (including user locations, channel quality, network resources, etc.) of future time slot cannot be obtained or even mathematically modeled at the beginning. An efficient and promising way to solve <span id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> is to resort to ML algorithms. Number of reinforcement learning algorithms can be adopted to solve the problem with long-term objective by interacting with dynamic environment via information exchanges. However, as mentioned above that the raw data in terms of user locations is quite private and should be carefully protected rather than being exchanged among multiple mSBSs like that in most reinforcement learning algorithms. To this effect, FL, which requires the exchanges of learning model rather than raw data, is next adopted to derive the optimal beam management policy of <span id="S3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose a novel beam management mechanism for mSBS beam configuration based on FL in UDmmN, called BMFL, with the aim to maximize the long-term throughput while enforcing the protection of user location privacy. Specifically, we first formulate the beam management problem as a markov decision process (MDP) model, and then propose BMFL based on the MDP model by exploiting federated DRL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on beam management in the scenario of ultra-dense mSBSs. If all the information of these mSBSs is sent to the MBS for centralized data aggregation and processing, it usually faces great challenges in terms of computation energy consumption, computational latency and learning time. Therefore, we adopt a decentralized learning technique (i.e., FL) where training datasets are distributed over mSBSs, instead of centralizing all the data. Another notable advantage of FL is the protection of data privacy. Although each mSBS can obtain the user information like location of its own serving users, it may be unconventional to share the information with other mSBSs. It is because that the location information is private to the user, it should not be shared with those mSBSs that are not associated with the user. Hence, the user information is regarded as sensitive information in the system and can be protected under the FL architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the problem has a high state and action dimensions, we exploit DDQN to use a neural network to estimate the value function, which improves the learning accuracy with a small compromise on the learning convergence speed. This is the insight in the DRL algorithm. The more insights lie on the FL framework, which can reduce the learning problem scale since each agent performs a distributed learning framework, and the aggregated global learning model is used to guide each agent converging fast. Also, the privacy of raw data can be ensured in the FL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.12" class="ltx_p">Even if mSBSs can obtain all location information of the serving users, it is unrealistic for the mSBSs to choose all the users in their coverage range to participate in local training as 1) the computing resources occupied for training on a specific mSBS may be inadequate, 2) the location of some certain users needs to be protected. Therefore, to solve the issue mentioned-above while increasing sample diversity as much as possible, mSBS will clean data according to the following two parameters. 1) The coverage of mSBS. The users that are not located in the coverage range will not be chosen to participate in local training. 2) The frequency of participating training. If some users have not participated in local model training for a long time, mSBS will choose them as the participants in the training for next global model updating and thus to increasing the sample diversity. Therefore, the users will be chosen to train local model on the mSBS once both condition (<a href="#S4.E8" title="In IV-B FL-based Beam Management in UDmmN ‣ IV FL-based Beam Management in UDmmN ‣ Beam Management in Ultra-dense mmWave Network via Federated Reinforcement Learning: An Intelligent and Secure Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) and (<a href="#S4.E9" title="In IV-B FL-based Beam Management in UDmmN ‣ IV FL-based Beam Management in UDmmN ‣ Beam Management in Ultra-dense mmWave Network via Federated Reinforcement Learning: An Intelligent and Secure Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>) are met.</p>

mSBS begins to train local beam management model based on the location information of participants within its coverage range. As mentioned, a large number of mSBSs and users result in large state space and action space. Therefore, during each communication round, we employ the discrete-action DRL algorithm, DDQN, to train the local beam management model on individual mSBSs. DDQN can tackle the issue of large state/action space by introducing the experience pool and decoupling the selection from the evaluation to reduce the correlation among data.

Each mSBS (local agent) conducts local training for a deep neural network to predict Q value, which is used for guiding action decisions (which sectors should be covered) in the reinforcement framework. After each round of local training, the weights in the neural network from all local agents should be aggregated by the MBS based on (16) to update the global model, which then is shared with all the local agents to guide them in obtaining a more accurate deep neural network as per the rule in (10).

communication rounds. In fact, for BMFL, the local update step can be regarded as fully distributed DRL, as individual mSBSs train a local learning model based on local dataset without data interaction or aggregation (i.e., each mSBS performs gradient descent to adjust the local model parameter to minimize the loss function defined on its own dataset). The global aggregation step can be regarded as centralized DRL if the global aggregation is performed after every local update and the data samples and features are available for the aggregator (i.e., the MBS). However, the BMFL algorithm has greater advantages in privacy protection than traditional centralized and distributed DRL algorithms, due to the data cleaning and non-raw-data aggregation.</p>

communication. For users with high QoS requirements, they may use directional beams to receive signals from the serving mSBSs, and thus a fine-grained beam training will be further required before data transmission. Since beam training is not the focus of this paper, we will not explain it in detail here.</p>

As both the mSBSs and users in mmWave network usually transmit/receive signals with directional beams pointing in different angular directions (spatially orthogonal to each other), the interference between simultaneous mmWave links will only be caused by beam sidelobes, which is usually very small and negligible. Furthermore, the co-beam interference (the interference between the users served by the same mSBS transmit beam) may be eliminated by appropriate spatial precoding. Therefore, the SINR can be approximated by the SNR for mmWaves which is quite different than that in sub-6GHz networks. In the learning part settings, we consider a fully connected neural network for each mSBS.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first evaluate the convergence performance of the proposed BMFL algorithm in terms of the average loss function value, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Beam Management in Ultra-dense mmWave Network via Federated Reinforcement Learning: An Intelligent and Secure Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. From this figure, we find that all curves under the three typical learning rates, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3, reach the convergence after a certain number of iterations. Specifically, the BMFL algorithm reaches the convergence after around 80 iterations when learning rate is 0.1 while around 130 iterations of learning rate 0.03 and nearly 200 iterations for learning rate 0.3. These convergence results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of BMFL. Meanwhile, observed from the figure, the average loss value of the algorithm presents dramatical decreasing in the beginning stages. The reason lies in the fact that, the gradient descent approach is employed by the BMFL algorithm to train the DDQN-based optimization framework, thereby the loss function converges faster at the beginning while becoming gentle near the minimum point. In addition to the learning rate, the convergence performance of BMFL is also related to some other hyperparameters such as the size of replay memory and minibatches. The parameters in TABLE II are chosen to make a tradeoff between the communication performance and the computational complexity according to the simulation results that are not shown here. These settings may not be optimal, but they can make our BMFL algorithm achieve a good convergence performance which will stimulate its practical application.</p>

respectively. These results further demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed BMFL algorithm. Meanwhile, although the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of user coverage is comparable to that of the optimal scheme BFS, it is slightly weak in terms of network throughput, which may be due to the difference of users they serve. We believe that when there is enough training data, the performance of BMFL in terms of network throughput can also reach the level of the BFS.</p>

Compared with BMDL, the proposed BMFL also adopts a distributed learning architecture. However, it has an advantage that the training model accuracy and learning convergence speed can be improved through the cooperation of multi-agent (e.g., mSBSs). Due to the small number of mSBSs in the simulation, this advantage is not obvious, so the performance of the two is similar. For BMCL, it may be that the algorithm converges to a suboptimal solution, which leads to the low results. The essence of machine learning algorithms determines that the optimal result cannot be guaranteed. It is an iterative updating process.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the directional transmission and dense network deployment, complexity of beam management problem in mmWave communication systems becomes a real challenge. To address the complex and dynamic beam control issue, in this paper we have proposed a federated DRL-based adaptive beam management algorithm, BMFL. In BMFL, individual mSBSs train a local machine learning model based on the cleaned local dataset and then send the model features to the MBS for aggregation. Meanwhile, we employed DDQN to train the local model on mSBSs under an FL framework. Due to the data cleaning and non-raw-data aggregation, the proposed BMFL algorithm has great advantages in privacy protection and wireless resource conservation (e.g., transmit power, bandwidth). Simulation results have shown that the BMFL provides a better tradeoff between computational complexity and network throughput. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme in user coverage is generally comparable to that of the optimal scheme BFS, which is also verified by the simulations. In general, this work can be seen as a pioneer of using FL to solve the systematic beam management problem under UDN scenarios.</p>
