<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for solving multilingual tasks, potentially enabling clients with their own language-specific data to collaboratively construct a high-quality neural machine translation (NMT) model.
However, communication constraints in practical network systems present challenges for exchanging large-scale NMT engines between FL parties.
In this paper, we propose a meta-learning-based adaptive parameter selection methodology, <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">MetaSend</span>, that improves the communication efficiency of model transmissions from clients during FL-based multilingual NMT training.
Our approach learns a dynamic threshold for filtering parameters prior to transmission without compromising the NMT model quality, based on the tensor deviations of clients between different FL rounds.
Through experiments on two NMT datasets with different language distributions, we demonstrate that <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> obtains substantial improvements over baselines in translation quality in the presence of a limited communication budget.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a popular distributed machine learning paradigm.
FL enables collaborative model training among a set of clients via periodic aggregations of local models by a server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Konecný et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.
The FL property of keeping data local to clients has important privacy advantages that have made it attractive for many learning applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Natural language processing (NLP) is one domain standing to benefit from FL since user-generated text may contain sensitive information.
Among the applications of FL in NLP, relatively few works have considered <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multilingual</span> NLP and the impact of different languages on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has shown substantial progress in this domain with the advent of large-scale language models such as BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, GPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Radford et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and their extensions. NMT has a further natural alignment with FL given its setting of non-IID local data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Weller et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>:
each client (user) typically has a specific language direction they are interested in for translation, which their local dataset will be skewed towards, motivating them to collaborate with each other via FL to construct the general NMT model.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, resource utilization is often a concern in deploying large-scale NMT models due to demands imposed on computational and memory resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ganesh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Gupta and Agrawal (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
While FL will distribute the processing load, every client must exchange its model parameters with a central server during the FL communication phases. Communication efficiency is a known bottleneck in traditional FL applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and becomes an even more critical challenge with large-scale NMT models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we are interested in optimizing multilingual NMT performance over an FL system with a limited communication budget.
A premise for our work is that exchanging complete NMT engines in FL might not be necessary, similar to the argument in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Passban et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
We can develop some intuition around this through a small FL experiment using the well-known <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAVG</span> algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
In Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we perform FL on the UN Corpus dataset (see Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experimental Design ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> for details) distributed across three clients (each containing one language translation direction), and plot the differences in NMT model tensors between a few consecutive training rounds for one of the clients.
These differences are computed and visualized tensor-by-tensor, indicating the deviation of each tensor.
We observe that the majority of deviation in the NMT model tensors cluster within small norms, while a small subset of tensors exhibit significant deviations. This observation is consistent across all clients, datasets, and data distribution combinations considered in this study.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recently,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Passban et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed a strategy of focusing on either highly fluctuating or less active tensors during FL communication to reduce computation load.
Their approach involves sending only a fixed portion of NMT parameters – namely, by sending either the top 50% or the bottom 50% of tensors based on their deviation, which is computed using the previous round’s engine.
The result of this is illustrated by the red threshold for the cases in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
However, sending a fixed portion of the parameters does not account for the fact that the deviation distribution will likely vary dynamically across rounds (as also observed in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
As a result, this approach is not sensitive to NMT quality, potentially resulting in the transmission of either too many parameters, i.e., extra communication burden without any significant change in translation quality, or too few parameters, i.e., leading to an undesirable model that negatively impacts translation quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contributions.</span> Motivated by this, our objective is to explore <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic</span> thresholding techniques for multilingual federated NMT.
The central challenge involved is how to adaptively determine a threshold that selectively filters out parameters from transmission until we expect that the translation quality will start to be compromised.
To address this, our methodology, <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter ltx_font_bold">MetaSend</span>, incorporates a meta-learning approach that generates a dynamic sending threshold adapting to the varying deviation distribution across training rounds. The result is depicted by the blue thresholds for the cases in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
In doing so, <span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> considers translation quality and communication efficiency as important objectives in multilingual NMT training.

During the FL communication phase, large NLP models are exchanged, introducing a significant communication cost associated with model updates.
To address this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Melas-Kyriazi and Wang (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed a gradient compression methodology for language modeling, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ro et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> leveraged similarities between smaller and larger models in cross-device FL.
The parameter selection method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Passban et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> targeting mixed-domain NMT is most relevant to our work. As discussed in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, they analyze how much deviation each client has from its previous round and send a fixed-portion of model’s tensors during FL communication.
However, sending a fixed amount of tensors without considering the varying deviation distribution can lead to lower translation quality by potentially removing meaningful parameters.
To handle these challenges, we design a meta-learning-based parameter selection method that sends the client’s parameters with dynamic thresholds to capture the tradeoff between communication efficiency and translation quality.

This communication can be quite costly for a large NMT model, which is a key bottleneck for FL.
To tackle this challenge, we propose <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span>, which adapts the NMT tensors sent based on a customized sending threshold for each communication round.
The key idea of <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> is to build Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> into the FL rounds to balance communication efficiency and translation quality.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the multilingual FL experimental settings in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Weller et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, we use the M2M-100 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> to conduct machine translation.
The M2M-100 model is a sequence-to-sequence model with 418M parameters, and it can translate between any pair of 100 languages.
We measure the quality of translation by using sacreBLEU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Post (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and COMET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rei et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
SacreBLEU is a commonly used metric for evaluating NMT quality, while COMET is a more advanced metric that shows some degree of correlation with human judgement.

In the first section, we observe that the centralized method outperforms PMFL methods, as we would expect; on the other hand, it compromises data privacy by not preserving individual client data confidentiality.
Further, the performance decrease of PMFL from IID to non-IID FL training reveals the challenges in the practical NMT scenario of clients having only single language directions.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By randomly sending the model parameters, RandSend achieves the lowest performance among all methods for both IID and non-IID FL.
Compared with our MetaSend methods, we see that the DP methods face challenges.
The significant performance improvements of <span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> over DP show the advantage of modeling an adaptive sending threshold based on the norm difference distribution.
Moreover, our MAML-learned threshold learns what to send during communication to better optimize the NMT task.
Note that this threshold is dynamic and can adapt to different norm difference distributions in each round.
Specifically, our <span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> method achieves average sacreBLEU improvements of 3.9 and 3.4 points over DP on IID and non-IID data, respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Translation Performance Evaluation ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we present the average sacreBLEU score and tensor savings for each method across 25 communication rounds on the MTNT (a and b) and UNMT (c and d) datasets.
The RandSend and DP methods can save around 50% of tensors during FL communication due to their designs.
By sending the tensors based on a specific learned threshold, <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> methods obtain substantial improvements in translation quality compared to DP methods, while also obtaining varying degrees of tensor savings.
Among our two <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> methods, <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend<sub id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_serif ltx_font_italic">l</span></sub></span> outperforms in translation quality, indicating that sending the majority of tensors for update ensures significant performance improvement.
On the other hand, <span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend<sub id="S5.SS2.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p1.2.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_serif ltx_font_italic">g</span></sub></span> demonstrates higher tensor savings, with an average of 10.3% more tensors saved compared to DP methods.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to evaluating tensor savings, Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Communication Efficiency Evaluation ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> provides the specific training time for each method. During local iterations, all methods require a similar amount of time to process the entire local training dataset and update all parameters in the model.
Although PMFL does not spend time on the parameter selection process, it consumes the most time in client communication and aggregation due to the necessity of transmitting and aggregating every tensor in the model.
Both DP and <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> require computation time for calculating deviations between a client’s current tensors and its tensors from the previous round.
However, DP carries out its operation by selecting either the top or bottom 50% of tensors, which occurs after all deviations have been calculated and sorted.
In contrast, <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> immediately decides whether to send a tensor based on the learned threshold after calculating a single deviation and without any sorting calculation.
As a result, <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> requires less time for parameter selection compared to DP.
Finally, the time required for sending and aggregation depends on the tensor savings of each scheme.</p>

The breakdown of the time spent on the MAML module for <span id="S5.SS2.p3.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> methods is provided in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Communication Efficiency Evaluation ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
We observe that the most time-consuming configuration is the meta-evaluation, which requires forward-passing a few batches to the global model and obtaining the validation loss.
Therefore, we conduct an ablation study in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a> to examine the impact of the number of sampled batches.
In sum, our proposed <span id="S5.SS2.p3.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> significantly enhances translation quality while achieving greater resource savings compared to both PMFL and DP methods.</p>

To explore the impact of the number of neurons on performance, we keep the learning parameters consistent while varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the MAML module.
In Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we see that using more neurons in the MAML module generally leads to improved results in terms of sacreBLEU score and tensor savings.
The performance gain from using more neurons is intuitive since it provides additional degrees of freedom for learning optimization.
However, it is important to note that using more neurons also incurs higher resource requirements during system construction.</p>

We see that increasing the number of samples used for MAML optimization generally results in improved translation quality and efficiency.
Naturally, using more batches will increase the exact time spent on our MAML module.
However, the time taken by clients to send parameters for aggregation may be more critical than this optimization time, as the optimization process is performed only once in each round.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted the first analysis on the efficiency of federated multilingual NMT.
To address the practical challenges that arise in this setup, we proposed <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span>, which selects tensors for transmission that are most critical to the NMT.
By adaptively learning the sending threshold in each FL round based on meta-learning, we saw that <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> not only improves communication efficiency, but also effectively captures the NMT threshold for sending.
Extensive experiments on two datasets showed that <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MetaSend</span> outperforms existing baselines regarding machine translation quality and significantly reduces communication costs in FL, confirming its advantage in practical federated NMT settings.</p>

For, Japanese (Ja) and Chinese (Zh), we use their respective tokenizers to ensure accurate evaluation.
We utilize the default COMET model as suggested by the authors, which employs a reference-based regression approach and is developed based on XLM-R. This model has been trained on direct assessments from WMT17 to WMT20 and assigns scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect translation. The COMET metric has been found to exhibit segment-level correlation with human evaluations and has demonstrated its potential to distinguish between high-performing systems more effectively.</p>

We can see that our method, trained under the IID setting, achieves a good translation compared to the ground truth by round 9. However, when trained under the Non-IID setting, our method requires 17 communication rounds to achieve comparable results. The result obtained at round 9 for our method trained under the Non-IID setting shows that the model has not yet converged, resulting in chaotic translations with mixed languages.</p>

<p id="A6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To mirror the limited data scenario of each client in practical FL, we performed experiments by randomly sampling a small portion of data from MTNT and UNMT datasets as training data. Specifically, we randomly selected 20% of samples from each dataset, resulting in 1k and 10k training samples in each language direction for MTNT and UNMT datasets, respectively, while keeping the validation and test sets at the same size. All other hyperparameters, such as batch size for the NMT engine or MAML optimization, neurons in the MAML module, and learning rate, remain the same as in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="A8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides additional results to Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>.
Figure <a href="#A8.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Appendix H Supplementary Results for Ablation Study ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> shows the ablation study of our method on the MTNT and UNMT datasets, examining the impact of using different numbers of neurons in our MAML module.
On the other hand, Figure <a href="#A8.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ Appendix H Supplementary Results for Ablation Study ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> presents the ablation study of our method, investigating the effects of using different batches for the MAML module.
We observe that these additional results align with the findings discussed in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>. Specifically, increasing the resources, such as the number of neurons or batches, for our MAML module generally results in improved performance.
Additionally, Table <a href="#A7.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ Appendix G FL Experiments Without Using Pre-trained Knowledge ‣ Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> provides specific time measurements for meta-evaluation with different numbers of batch samples. Intuitively, it can be observed that using more samples for meta-learning will result in increased time requirements.</p>
