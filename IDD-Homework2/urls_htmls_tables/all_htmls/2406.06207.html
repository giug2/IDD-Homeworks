<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning technique where multiple clients work together with a central server to train a global model without sharing their private data. However, the distribution shift across non-IID datasets of clients poses a challenge to this one-model-fits-all method hindering the ability of the global model to effectively adapt to each client’s unique local data. To echo this challenge, personalized FL (PFL) is designed to allow each client to create personalized local models tailored to their private data.</p>
<p id="id3.id2" class="ltx_p">While extensive research has scrutinized backdoor risks in FL, it has remained underexplored in PFL applications. In this study, we delve deep into the vulnerabilities of PFL to backdoor attacks. Our analysis showcases a tale of two cities. On the one hand, the personalization process in PFL can dilute the backdoor poisoning effects injected into the personalized local models. Furthermore, PFL systems can also deploy both server-end and client-end defense mechanisms to strengthen the barrier against backdoor attacks. On the other hand, our study shows that PFL fortified with these defense methods may offer a false sense of security. We propose <span id="id3.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, a stealthy and effective backdoor attack strategy applicable to PFL systems. <span id="id3.id2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> ingeniously aligns the backdoor learning task with the main learning task of PFL by optimizing the trigger generation process. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of <span id="id3.id2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> in seamlessly embedding triggers into personalized local models. <span id="id3.id2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> yields outstanding attack performance across 10 state-of-the-art PFL algorithms, defeating the existing 6 defense mechanisms. Our study sheds light on the subtle yet potent backdoor threats to PFL systems, urging the community to bolster defenses against emerging backdoor challenges.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional federated learning (FL) techniques encounter the challenge of addressing data heterogeneity issues arising from non-IID data distributions among local devices in real-world scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. For example, when using FL to develop a language model for mobile keyboards, clients from diverse demographic groups may demonstrate distinct usage patterns due to cultural, linguistic, and generational disparities. To address this challenge, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a recent technological advancement. Unlike conventional FL, which relies on a single global model, PFL introduces personalized local models that effectively adapt to the unique data distribution of each client, thereby enhancing classification accuracy for individual clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Various PFL strategies have been explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, which can be categorized into full model-sharing methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and partial model-sharing methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Full model-sharing methods involve globally aggregated models that clients adapt through techniques such as fine-tuning with local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, parallel global and local model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, global model regularization during local training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, or the weighted average of global and local models for local training initialization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. In partial model-sharing methods, only part of the classifier model is shared among different clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> shares the feature encoder while keeping the classification head private for each client. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> globally aggregates model parameters except for batch normalization layers for each client.
As reported in these works, PFL outperforms traditional FL by creating personalized local models with significantly higher classification accuracy on each client’s local data in non-IID scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Customizing personalized local models for clients is both a blessing and a curse. While PFL methods enhance classification accuracy for clients, they concurrently open the door to backdoor attacks. Adversaries can seamlessly transfer backdoor triggers to personalized local models by optimizing the backdoor poisoning effect in the globally shared model. Previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> highlight traditional FL’s vulnerability to backdoor attacks orchestrated by adversary-controlled clients. These malicious clients submit carefully crafted local models to establish trigger-target mappings in the global model, thereby manipulating it to output the adversary’s desired label for backdoor data.
However, compared to traditional FL, PFL introduces additional barriers against backdoor attacks due to the personalization process adopted by benign clients, which fine-tunes the global model to better fit individual client data. Even if backdoors are successfully injected into the global model, personalization techniques can mitigate the backdoor poisoning effects in the personalized local models using backdoor-free data.
For instance, local fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is one such personalization technique that utilizes the client’s backdoor-free data to tune the global model. Fine-tuning global models with backdoor-free data can disrupt the presence of the backdoor trigger in personalized local models, leading to catastrophic forgetting of the trigger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, thereby mitigating backdoor poisoning effects on these models.
Therefore, executing successful backdoor attacks in PFL requires not only maintaining stealthiness to evade defenses deployed at the central server or local clients but also ensuring the persistence of backdoor poisoning effects throughout the personalization process. However, the specific threat posed by backdoor attacks within the personalization context of PFL remains relatively underexplored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our study aims to fill this gap by exploring the potential threat of backdoor attacks in PFL systems and demonstrating their feasibility to mainstream PFL techniques, covering both state-of-the-art full and partial model sharing PFL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Traditional backdoor attacks on FL encounter three primary bottlenecks when targeting PFL.
<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">First</span>, in full model-sharing PFL methods, fine-tuning the global model with clean local training data can weaken the backdoor poisoning effect. This phenomenon is akin to catastrophic forgetting<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, where the local model forgets the trigger-target mapping, thereby reducing the impact of backdoor poisoning effects.
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Second</span>, in partial model-sharing PFL methods, only the globally shared layers of a neural network are aggregated at the server, while each client customizes the remaining layers using their clean local training data. Adversaries can only inject backdoor poisoning effects into the globally shared layers. It remains uncertain whether these backdoor poisoning effects can persist in the personalized local model, which consists of the poisoned globally shared layers and privately owned local layers.
Empirical observations in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Empirical Evaluation ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a> confirm PFL systems’ resilience to backdoor attacks on clients’ personalized local models. For instance, Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1.2 Backdoor Poisoned Local Training ‣ 4.1 The Design of PFedBA ‣ 4 The PFedBA-based attack method ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows that the existing backdoor attacks cannot succeed in inserting the backdoor trigger into personalized local models, whether from partial or full model-sharing PFL algorithms on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Furthermore</span>, PFL systems can deploy both server-end and client-end countermeasures against backdoor attacks to enhance their resilience to model integrity threats. The central server can leverage robust aggregation algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> to counteract the poisoning effects introduced by malicious clients. Simultaneously, local clients can utilize backdoor mitigation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> on their local devices to remove potential backdoor triggers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these challenges, our research reveals that the flourishing of PFL approaches fortified with various defense mechanisms is a false sense of comfort in the face of the threat of backdoor poisoning attacks. To substantiate this backdoor threat, we introduce a novel backdoor attack method, <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, and evaluate its effectiveness against mainstream PFL approaches in different scenarios. Experimental results show that <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> can perform successful attacks against mainstream PFL approaches, circumventing state-of-the-art server-end and client-end defense methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our design of <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> is inspired by the recent advancements in understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks.
First of all, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has shown that deep neural networks trained using gradient descent can be mathematically equivalent to a Gaussian process equipped with neural tangent kernels (NTKs). According to the theory of NTK, the similarity between the decision boundaries of two neural network models can be quantified by measuring the degree of alignment between the gradient vectors of the two models.
Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> reveal that the loss landscape of a neural network training process nearly contains one single basin at convergence. By strategically manipulating the training data, It is possible to guide two neural network models to converge towards the same loss basin, ultimately leading to similar classification boundaries, a.k.a Machine Teaching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
With these concepts in mind, our intuition is: if we align the gradient of the backdoor task with that of the main learning task, and align the classification loss of the two tasks into the same loss basin, we will obtain a backdoor-poisoned model whose classification boundary closely resembles that of the backdoor-free model trained with clean data. Maintaining consistency in classification boundaries enables the backdoor poisoning effects to persist during the personalization process and evade the defense mechanisms deployed at both local clients and the central server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">More specifically, we formulate the backdoor attack method against PFL as a joint optimization problem, where the backdoor trigger and poisoned model parameters are simultaneously optimized during the global training phase. Our goal is twofold: minimizing the classification loss on the backdoor input by alternately optimizing the trigger and model parameters while minimizing the Euclidean distance between the gradient of the backdoor task and the gradient of the main task in each attack iteration. In this way, we align the gradients and losses of the main and backdoor tasks, making the decision boundary of the backdoor poisoned model very similar to that of the clean model. In Section <a href="#S4" title="4 The PFedBA-based attack method ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we elaborate on how <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> persists within PFL algorithms, and this persistence holds true even in the presence of defense mechanisms.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> have highlighted the vulnerability of FL to distributed backdoor attacks launched by malicious clients in FL systems.
Pioneering efforts in this domain, such as the <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sybil attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Model Replacement attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DBA</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, organize distributed backdoor attacks by having malicious clients independently train and submit the poisoned local model.
<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sybil attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> involves malicious clients submitting backdoor-poisoned local models directly targeting FedAvg-based aggregation rules that aggregate model parameters from both benign and malicious clients.
<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Model Replacement attack</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> strengthens significantly the attack strength by scaling up the poisoned model updates submitted by malicious clients, effectively achieving its attack objective in very few global aggregation iterations.
Since the model parameters submitted by malicious clients are distinguished from those submitted by benign clients, both attacks can be easily mitigated by Byzantine-robust FL methods.
Besides, <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DBA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a><span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> divides a global trigger into multiple local triggers and distributes them to all malicious clients.

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Effective as they are, these distributed backdoor attack methods are designed to poison only the globally shared model in FL systems. It remains an open question whether embedded backdoor effects persist in personalized local models. Nonetheless, from these studies, we can gain insights from two perspectives. First, optimizing the learning process of backdoor poisoned local models by constraining or regularizing gradient updates can narrow the gap between the backdoor and clean models, aiding in evading the robust FL methods without compromising backdoor attack performance.
Second, as suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, it is feasible for the adversary to adapt the trigger pattern to improve attack performance, yet guarantee the high utility of the backdoor model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our study is guided by these insights learned from previous works.

</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that our work focuses on exploring the vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks in PFL systems that incorporate both global training and local personalization, encompassing both partial and full model-sharing PFL methods. In contrast, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> focuses solely on attacks targeting partial model-sharing PFL systems, where only the classification head is fine-tuned locally, while the feature encoder is globally shared among all clients.
Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> focuses on the HyperNetFL system, which employs a neural network hosted by the server to generate local model parameters for each client using the client-specific descriptor and parameters of a special shared model as inputs. Backdooring this HyperNetFL model resembles backdooring traditional FL systems, where a specially crafted model embedded with backdoors is shared among all clients. This differs from the PFL system examined in our study, which incorporates a local personalization process.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client-end Backdoor Defenses.</span> Current strategies addressing backdoor attacks in centralized machine learning can be classified into three main categories: pre-training defense, in-training defense, and post-training defense, as outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Pre-training defense methods, like <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Februus</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, focus on identifying and removing poisoned data samples before the model training phase. However, these methods are not practical in FL systems due to privacy-preserving protocols. In-training defense mechanisms, exemplified by <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">anti-backdoor learning techniques<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a><span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.3.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span>, aim to mitigate the impact of backdoor poisoning during the model training process. Nevertheless, this approach faces challenges in FL because the distributed nature of FL restricts the defender from overseeing the local training processes of individual clients. Post-training defense methods concentrate on eliminating or mitigating the backdoor poisoning effects in already-trained models. For instance, <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Neural Cleanse</span> (NC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> functions by reversing the trigger on clean data instances and subsequently removing the backdoor through unlearning-based deep neural network patching or neuron pruning. Another approach, <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Neural Attention Distillation</span> (NAD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, achieves backdoor mitigation by pruning neurons highly correlated with the backdoor trigger.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our study explores whether these state-of-the-art server-end and client-end defense methods can enhance the resilience of the PFL system against the proposed backdoor attack when adopted by both the server and benign clients.
Our key insight lies in the alignment of losses and gradients between backdoor and main tasks, offering a two-fold advantage in evading these defense methods. Firstly, it reduces model bias between backdoor-poisoned and clean models, facilitating bypass the server-end defenses. Secondly, aligning the main task with the backdoor task narrows the gap between the decision boundaries of the backdoor model and the clean model, enabling the circumvention of client-end defenses.</p>

The objective of backdoor attacks in PFL differs from those in traditional FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. While backdoor attacks against traditional FL aim to induce misclassification in the global model for trigger-embedded inputs, adversaries targeting PFL aim to introduce backdoor poisoning effects into personalized local models. The poisoned personalized local models should produce the adversary-desired output for trigger-embedded inputs while functioning normally for inputs without triggers. Our focus further extends to stealthy backdoor attacks, designed to bypass both server-end and client-end defenses while ensuring the success of the attacks.</p>

As such, our work is based on a logical premise within our threat model: if an adversary can successfully execute backdoor attacks with such limited knowledge and attack capabilities, the potential for even more severe threats to model integrity increases when the adversary possesses greater attack capabilities and richer knowledge of the target PFL system. Our findings provide insights into the vulnerability of real-world PFL applications to backdoor attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The common way of backdoor attack is to train the model using the trigger-embedded data, in order to force the model to memorize the association between the trigger-embedded input with the adversary-desired classification output. However, the backdoor poisoning effect embedded in the globally shared model can be diluted during the personalization process. In this process, the globally shared model is further fine-tuned with clean training data hosted by local clients. Due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon unveiled in neural networks, the poisoning effect becomes significantly weaker with more rounds of local model tuning. Besides, injecting an arbitrary trigger may cause excessive malicious model bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The backdoor poisoned local models may thus be easily detected by the server-end defense mechanisms during the global aggregation stage of PFL. At the personalization stage, benign clients can also deploy client-end backdoor mitigation methods to detect and mitigate the backdoor trigger in the local model.
To address these bottlenecks, we consider both the trigger and the global model parameters as optimization variables in <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>.

Intuitively, minimizing the Euclidean distance serves to bring the gradient of the backdoor task closer to that of the main task. As benign clients adapt the model using clean training data through gradient descent, the memory of the mapping between the trigger-embedded input and the adversary-desired class label in the personalized local model is strengthened due to the consistent gradient direction of the main task and the backdoor task. Therefore, this gradient alignment term prevents the erasure of triggers during the personalization stage.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the idea of introducing gradient alignment into our attack is also inspired by theoretical breakthroughs in Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Originally introduced to explain the evolution of deep neural networks using gradient descent during training, NTK theory allows us to measure the similarity between the decision boundaries of two neural network models based on the inner product between the gradients of the two neural network models for given inputs. The greater the inner product (reflecting closer alignment between the gradients), the more similar the decision boundaries of these two models are. Building upon this theory, we enforce alignment between the gradients of the backdoor task and the main task, with the goal of making the decision boundary of the backdoor model as similar as possible to the decision boundary of the backdoor-free model.

Intuitively, if a model well-trained on backdoor-free data can achieve a low classification loss on backdoored data, the attack objective is achieved without significantly altering the model parameters, thereby mitigating malicious model bias caused by trigger injections. Therefore, the objective of loss alignment is to align the classification loss for the backdoor task with that of the main task through trigger optimization, bringing them into the same loss landscape on the model without changing the model parameters.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of trigger generation using the loss alignment can find its origin in the concept of Machine Teaching<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>: given a testing set, fine-tuning the training data can calibrate the decision boundary of a classifier and help the classifier produce the desired classification outputs for the test data. We follow the spirit of Machine Teaching and minimize the backdoor classification loss, thus achieving loss alignment between the main task and the backdoor task on the model. This alignment helps minimize the divergence in decision boundaries between the backdoor and backdoor-free models. Therefore, the client-end backdoor mitigation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> may be ineffective in removing adversary-specified backdoor triggers, since these methods cannot distinguish between the decision boundaries in backdoor and backdoor-free models.</p>

Aligning the loss landscape of the backdoor task with that of the main task forces the backdoor model to converge to the same basin area of the backdoor-free model, which can effectively reduce the model bias between backdoor models and backdoor-free models, thereby allowing the trigger to evade the server-end defense methods.</p>

In contrast, the other baseline attacks face challenges when attempting to inject triggers into personalized local models, even in scenarios where PFL systems do not employ defenses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> consistently achieves ASR values exceeding 80% for all 10 PFL algorithms across the 4 datasets, while maintaining ACC values similar to the non-attacked model (NoAttack).
However, the attack baselines often struggle to successfully inject backdoor triggers into personalized local models. For Fashion-MNIST, the ASR values for all the attack baselines are below 47% against <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(FO)</span>, <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span>, and <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedRep</span>, while <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> achieves ASR values exceeding 93%.
On CIFAR-10 and N-BaIoT, under <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-FedAvg(HF)</span>, none of the baseline attacks can achieve ASR values exceeding 60%, whereas <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> achieves ASR values exceeding 82%.
Similarly, the ASR values of the baseline attacks are lower than 51% against <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span> on CIFAR-100, while <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> obtains a 98.9% ASR value.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The personalization process forces the personalized local models to forget the trigger-target mappings by adapting the local models with backdoor-free local training data. These attack baselines are designed without considering the impact of the personalization process with clean data on the backdoor effects. Therefore, embedding triggers into personalized local models within PFL systems becomes challenging for these baseline attacks.
<span id="S5.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, on the contrary, proactively aligns the gradients of the backdoor and main tasks by optimizing the trigger. This design enables the model to exploit as much trigger-related information as possible from the gradient of the main task. Moreover, by aligning the main task with the backdoor task, the backdoor model exhibits the decision boundary that closely resembles that of the clean model, so that the trigger can persist in personalized local models.</p>

For N-BaIoT, <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> achieves ASR values greater than 93% against <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Krum</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLAME</span> under <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(FO)</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span>, while the attack baselines fail to attain ASR values higher than 37%.
Similarly, on CIFAR-10, <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> achieves ASR values higher than 94% against <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Trimmed mean</span> under <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg-FT</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p7.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx-FT</span>, outperforming other attack baselines with ASR values lower than 40%.

<p id="S5.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">These attack baselines fail to minimize the trigger-induced model bias, which makes them difficult to bypass defense methods deployed at the central server. Although <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CerP</span> can adapt a pre-specified trigger to reduce malicious model biases, which help bypass the server-end defenses. However, this method is restricted from two perspectives. Firstly, it can only slightly change the given trigger with a strict L2-ball constraint posed to the trigger optimization. In contrast, <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> offers significantly greater tuning flexibility by allowing the adversary to generate and optimise the task-specific trigger. Second, <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> enforces both gradient and loss alignment objectives to explicitly narrow down the gap between the gradient descent trajectories of the backdoor and clean models. Furthermore, the loss alignment enables the models to learn the trigger without significantly changing the model parameters. Consequently, <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> outperforms the other attacks by producing higher ASR facing the deployed server-end defense methods. For example, on Fashion-MNIST, the ASR value of <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> is at least 40% higher than that of other attack baselines. The results confirm that <span id="S5.SS2.p9.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> performs well in evading the server-end defense methods and retaining more backdoor poisoning effects than the other baselines.</p>

Our findings reveal that backdoor mitigation techniques applied by benign clients are unable to remove the trigger embedded in personalized local models by <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>. ASR of <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> consistently exceeds 70% against <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NC</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NAD</span> across all 10 PFL methods on Fashion-MNIST and B-NaIoT. Conversely, backdoor triggers introduced by the other attack baselines are identified and removed by <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NC</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NAD</span>.
For example, on Fashion-MNIST and B-NaIoT, all the attack baselines against <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NC</span> achieve a maximum ASR value of only 39.9%. However, <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> can achieve an ASR value of at least 70%, successfully embedding the trigger into the personalized local models. Similarly, against <span id="S5.SS2.p10.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NAD</span> on Fashion-MNIST, all the attack baselines achieve an ASR value of no more than 61%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p11.1" class="ltx_p">The explanation behind can be summarized in the followings. On one hand, the baseline attacks cause significant differences in the decision boundaries between backdoor and backdoor-free models. The client-end backdoor mitigation methods can exploit the gap and thus effectively eliminate the backdoor poisoning effect.
On the other hand, the gradient and loss alignment optimization adopted in <span id="S5.SS2.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> brings the decision boundary of the backdoor model as close as possible to that of the backdoor-free model. Therefore, <span id="S5.SS2.p11.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NC</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p11.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NAD</span> cannot distinguish the backdoor model from the backdoor-free models, allowing <span id="S5.SS2.p11.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> to bypass these client-end defense mechanisms.</p>

Due to space limitations, we show the results on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 in Tables <a href="#A7.T12" title="Table 12 ‣ Appendix G The Euclidean Distance ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> and <a href="#A7.T13" title="Table 13 ‣ Appendix G The Euclidean Distance ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> in Appendix <a href="#A8" title="Appendix H Ablation Study of PFedBA on CIFAR-10 ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">H</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p13.1" class="ltx_p">By observing the results, we find that both gradient alignment and loss alignment modules are necessary to ensure the success of <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>. Removing any of these modules significantly decreases the ASR value of <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>.
For example, on Fashion-MNIST, <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> achieves ASR values exceeding 87% against <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DnC</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLAME</span> under <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedRep</span>. In contrast, the variant of <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> without gradient alignment (referred to as No-Gradient) yields an ASR value of less than 27%.
Besides, on Fashion-MNIST, <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> attains ASR values over 89% against <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Krum</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DnC</span> under <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(HF)</span>. However, the variant of <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> without loss alignment (referred to as No-Loss) fails to conduct a successful attack, with ASR values below 11%.
Similarly, on CIFAR-10, the absence of any alignment module reduces the ASR values of <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, especially under <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p13.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedRep</span>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As revealed in our study, we can summarize the vulnerability of PFL facing backdoor attacks from two perspectives:</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Compared to conventional FL, PFL gains more resilience to backdoor attacks by the personalization process and defense methods deployed on both the central server and local clients.</span>
First, the personalized local model forgets the knowledge of triggers during the personalization process by learning information from clean local datasets. Second, defense methods employed at the central server can minimize the impact of malicious local model updates on the global model during the global aggregation stage. Finally, backdoor mitigation methods deployed on benign clients can eliminate the presence of backdoor triggers in the personalized local model. Consequently, the integration of the personalization process and defense mechanisms enhances PFL’s resilience to backdoor attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aligning the backdoor task with the main task is the key-to-success in embedding the triggers into the personalized local models in PFL.</span>
Despite the strong resilience of PFL against backdoor attacks, we can still carry out successful and stealthy backdoor attacks by enforcing the loss alignment and the gradient alignment between the main task and the backdoor task. On the one hand, enforcing both alignments can decrease the expected backdoor classification loss in the local model of benign clients during the personalization process, thus preventing the personalized local model from forgetting the embedded backdoor triggers. On the other hand, aligning the main task and the backdoor task narrows the gap between the decision boundary of the backdoor model and that of the backdoor-free model. This alignment enables the adversary to circumvent the defense methods implemented on the server or local clients and embed the backdoor into the personalized local model. This backdoor attack raises a severe security concern regarding model integrity in practical PFL applications. Therefore, we appeal to the security community to devise mitigation strategies that can effectively counter these risks.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the threat posed by backdoor attacks on the PFL system. Our findings illustrate that the PFL system can mitigate the backdoor poisoning effect by using its unique personalization process. Additionally, deploying defense mechanisms on both the central server and local clients can further enhance the PFL system’s resistance to backdoor attacks. Nonetheless, we introduce a new backdoor attack method called <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, which utilizes the alignment of loss and gradient between the main learning task and the backdoor learning task to highlight the vulnerabilities of robust-enhanced PFL systems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> can effectively inject backdoor triggers into personalized local models, circumventing defense methods within the PFL system.
In future work, our aim is to develop a defense method inspired by the concept of randomized smoothing. This method will adaptively optimize the magnitude of added noise to mitigate backdoor poisoning effects while preserving the performance of the main task to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <span id="A1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, we optimize the backdoor trigger through gradient alignment and loss alignment between the main and backdoor tasks. The trigger generated at the convergence of the backdoor-poisoned federated training process serves as the final trigger for the attack during testing, achieving minimal classification loss and high ASRs for the backdoor task.
To illustrate the backdoor trigger optimized by <span id="A1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, we visualize the optimized triggers applied to the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, and B-NaIoT datasets.

Additionally, for the B-NaIoT tabular dataset, the adversary selects a subset of features from the feature space of data samples to serve as the trigger, assigning specific values predefined by the adversary to these features.

However, <span id="A5.p4.5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLCert</span> faces limitations when applied to PFL systems due to several reasons. First, <span id="A5.p4.5.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLCert</span> randomly selects clients to train global models and then employs voting among these global models for final predictions. However, in partial model-sharing PFL systems where only the feature encoder is globally trained, omitting the classification head, conducting a vote among multiple global models for prediction results becomes infeasible.
Second, according to the setting in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the FL system consists of 1,000 local clients, training a total of <math id="A5.p4.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N=500" display="inline"><semantics id="A5.p4.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mo id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">500</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A5.p4.4.m4.1b"><apply id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><cn type="integer" id="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="A5.p4.4.m4.1.1.3">500</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A5.p4.4.m4.1c">N=500</annotation></semantics></math> global models to form the ensemble.

<p id="A7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#A7.T11" title="Table 11 ‣ Appendix G The Euclidean Distance ‣ Lurking in the shadows: Unveiling Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows the Euclidean distance between the backdoor local model generated by various backdoor attacks and the backdoor-free global model obtained in the previous global model training iteration in the full model-sharing PFL methods. These results are derived from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
We observe that, under the meta learning-based PFL methods, including <span id="A7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(FO)</span>, <span id="A7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(HF)</span>, and <span id="A7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span>, all the backdoor attacks result in relatively small model biases. This is because these PFL methods aim to find an initial global model that can quickly adapt to the client’s local data, resulting in less model biases in the backdoor local models.</p>

<div id="A7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">More importantly, we find that our <span id="A7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> method produces the least Euclidean distance between the backdoor local model and the backdoor-free global model aggregated at the previous iteration. This observation confirms the design of the gradient alignment and loss alignment in <span id="A7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>. The two alignment-driven regularization terms reduce the gap between the backdoor model and the backdoor-free model on the optimization path and decision boundary. Notably, the gradient alignment term explicitly reduces the difference between the gradient descent trajectories between the backdoor and backdoor-free models. Furthermore, enforcing the loss alignment term helps the backdoor model to better learn the trigger without significantly changing the model parameters. In summary, our <span id="A7.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> attack method, based on gradient alignment and loss alignment, effectively mitigates the impact of the personalization process on the backdoor poisoning effect and enables the triggers to bypass both server-end and client-end defense mechanisms.</p>

</div>
<div id="A8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results indicate that integrating the gradient alignment module into the <span id="A8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> attack significantly improves its attack performance compared to the variant of <span id="A8.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> without this module (noted as No-Gradient).
Specifically, <span id="A8.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> with gradient alignment consistently achieves ASR values exceeding 75% against <span id="A8.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Trimmed mean</span>, <span id="A8.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DnC</span>, and <span id="A8.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLAME</span> under <span id="A8.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(HF)</span> on CIFAR-10. In contrast, the variant of <span id="A8.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> without gradient alignment fails to conduct a successful attack, resulting in ASR values below 40%.
Moreover, the results also emphasize the importance of the loss alignment module for the success of <span id="A8.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>. For instance, in CIFAR-10, the ASR values of the <span id="A8.p2.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> variant without the loss alignment module (referred to as No-Loss) falls below 25% against <span id="A8.p2.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DnC</span> when using <span id="A8.p2.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(FO)</span> and <span id="A8.p2.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(HF)</span>.
Similarly, in Fashion-MNIST, the absence of any alignment module reduces
the ASR values of <span id="A8.p2.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>, especially under <span id="A8.p2.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Per-Fedavg(HF)</span>, <span id="A8.p2.1.16" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pFedMe</span> and <span id="A8.p2.1.17" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedRep</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="A8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, these results validate the indispensability of both gradient alignment and loss alignment modules within the <span id="A8.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> attack framework.</p>

The results indicate that the attack performance of <span id="A9.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> remains consistent even when the number of clients increases.
Specifically, <span id="A9.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> can achieve more than 80% ASR values under all the PFL algorithms on N-BaIoT and Fashion-MNIST, regardless of the total number of clients. Additionally, even with defense mechanisms deployed at the central server, <span id="A9.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span> can still attain an ASR value greater than 70% against all the PFL methods on both datasets.

This confirms the effectiveness of <span id="A10.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PFedBA</span>. Moreover, there is a slight decrease in the ASR values in certain tested scenarios as the trigger size decreases. This decline may be attributed to the smaller trigger size resulting in less flexibility in optimizing the trigger injected into the training data, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving the desired attack objectives.</p>
