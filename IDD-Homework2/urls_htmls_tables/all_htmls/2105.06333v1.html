<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a class of billiards with chaotic unidirectional flows (or non-chaotic unidirectional flows with “vortices”) which go around a chaotic or non-chaotic “core”, where orbits can change their orientation. Moreover, the corresponding billiard tables are simply connected in difference with many attempts to build billiards with interesting and/or exotic dynamics by putting inside billiard tables various “scatterers” with funny shapes. Therefore the billiards in this new class are amenable to experimental studies in physics labs as well as to the rigorous mathematical ones, which may shed a new light on understanding of classical and quantum dynamics of Hamiltonian systems.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Among the main advances of the 20th century science was the discovery that deterministic (dynamical) systems can demonstrate an enormously broad variety of behaviors, from completely regular (integrable) to completely chaotic. Most of the essential steps in this striking progress were based on finding various classes of dynamical systems, which demonstrated new, often unexpected and counter-intuitive, types of behavior. Billiards play a special role in the list of basic classes of dynamical systems. While being arguably the most ancient class of dynamical systems ever studied (what is called now integrability of billiards in circles, was known for millennia) it remains on a forefront of the theory of dynamical systems and their applications. This special role of billiards is mainly due to two factors. Billiards form one of the most visual classes of dynamical systems (if not just the most visual one) and besides, billiards are natural models of many real life phenomena, first of all in physics.
The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new class of billiards, which demonstrate various new surprising properties. At the same time, these billiards are amenable to rigorous mathematical, as well as to promising numerical, and even to experimental, studies.
Formally these billiards could be considered as generalizations of the first class of billiards, which was presented as a justification of the discovery of a new mechanism of chaos (hyperbolicity) in dynamical systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, called the mechanism of defocusing. Boundaries of the first billiard tables, which demonstrated the mechanism of defocusing, consist of arcs of circles, so that the arcs completing all components of the boundary to the full circles lie within the corresponding billiard table. Such systems were called flower-like billiards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and later referred to as Bunimovich flowers (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>). In what follows we will refer to this class of billiards as to circular flowers. It is worthwhile to mention that so beloved, especially by the physics community, stadium billiard is, in fact, a very special and even a singular example in this class. Indeed, a stadium arose from a flower with two circular petals by taking their common tangents. Such billiards were initially called squashes. A squash becomes stadium, when two circular arcs have the same radius.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The boundaries of the presented in this paper class of billiards consist of pieces of ellipses. Therefore these billiards will be called elliptic flowers (EF). However, in difference with circular flowers, which always have chaotic and ergodic dynamics, this class of billiards demonstrates a large variety of possible behaviors. For instance, a billiard is called a track billiard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> if almost all its orbits always move clockwise or counter-clockwise. Again, an ancient example of such dynamics is given by an integrable billiard between two concentric circles. A natural (although somewhat ambitious) question was whether there exist track billiards with chaotic behavior. This question arises in quantum chaos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> in search of examples/situations where Shnirelman peak <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> in the spectrum of the Schroedinger operator may appear. In a track billiard this peak naturally appears in the phase space at the common boundary of tracks. Although existence of chaotic tracks sounded a little bit too exotic, it was proved that there exist such billiards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In elliptic flowers, which the present paper introduces, always exist tracks, which could be chaotic or non-chaotic. However, these tracks do not occupy the entire phase space, as it was in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Instead these tracks are going around a core, which also is an invariant set with a positive measure. Dynamics in the core also (as in tracks) can be chaotic or non-chaotic. A simple description of dynamics in the elliptic flowers billiards is the existence of a core surrounded by two flows (tracks) going in the opposite directions, which could be chaotic or have internal “vortices”. Dynamics in the core could be chaotic or be the one typical for a generic Hamiltonian system, i.e. a mixture of elliptic islands and chaotic “seas”. It should be noted that an integrable billiard in ellipse has two integrable tracks, consisting of orbits tangent to the confocal smaller ellipses. The corresponding (integrable) core consists of orbits which intersect the segment between the foci after any reflection off the boundary. Therefore the new in spirit elliptic flowers are the ones where either tracks or cores are chaotic, or the both are chaotic. Of course, if a billiard has a caustic, then orbits which do not intersect the caustic form two tracks, and the rest form a core. However, the issue is to investigate dynamics in tracks and core. Examples with regular dynamics, e.g. ellipses are well known.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An important property of the elliptic flowers is that these billiard tables are simply connected. In other words, they do not have any internal boundaries, which are often used in constructions of billiards with various exotic behaviors. Therefore, elliptic flowers can be built as experimental devices joining in the labs mushrooms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which actually have more sophisticated, than the elliptic flowers, boundaries. In this respect, it is also worthwhile to mention that by varying the natural parameters, which describe the EFs, one can change dynamics of elliptic flowers in several ways. Such studies may shed a new light on our understanding of dynamics of generic Hamiltonian systems, both in the classical and quantum settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another possible use of elliptic flowers comes from the theory of the slow-fast systems, where a recent breakthrough established importance of non-ergodicity for effective averaging over fast dynamics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Particularly, mushroom billiards, which always have a divided into KAM islands and ergodic chaotic “seas” phase space, were effectively used in these studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Indeed, the elliptic flowers, which we consider here, are always non-ergodic because of existence of at least three ergodic components, which are tracks and a core. Moreover, the boundaries of elliptic flowers can be smoothed, what cannot be done for mushroom billiards and for circular flowers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the present paper the examples are given of elliptic flowers billiards with chaotic and non-chaotic tracks, surrounding chaotic and non-chaotic cores. Moreover, the first example of another phenomenon is given, which goes against the developed community intuition about billiards. It is universally known that, although mechanism of defocusing generates chaotic (hyperbolic) dynamics, the correlations in billiards with at least one focusing component of the boundary always decay slowly (power-like). On another hand, the correlations decay exponentially in dispersing billiards (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>). We demonstrate that in the chaotic cores of the elliptic flowers the correlations may decay exponentially. This result once again shows that the mechanism of dispersing is a special case of the mechanism of defocusing, not just formally, what is obvious, but also factually. Indeed, the purely focusing billiards can generate any type of behavior which dispersing billiards may generate as well as quite different dynamics from the one of dispersing billiards. (Defocusing is clearly more general because this mechanism allows the orbits to converge and diverge in configuration space, while dispersing allows only divergence of the orbits. Therefore dispersing is the limiting case of defocusing when orbits never converge).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our goal here is to present the simplest sub-classes of the elliptic flowers billiards which demonstrate all the described above new types of dynamics. Therefore in this paper we consider only the simplest elliptic flowers billiards. It allows to provide either simple and visual proofs, or the results immediately follow from the already existing ones in the mathematical theory of billiards. These general results actually have quite sophisticated and long proofs, but they allow almost immediately conclude our results here. Already consideration of these simplest cases allows to get all the promised results on coexistence of chaotic or non-chaotic tracks with chaotic or non-chaotic cores. All four possible types of coexistence are demonstrated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, the dynamics of general elliptic flower billiards is much richer. Therefore some natural questions, which arise for the future studies of the EFs billiards, are discussed in the last section. Some conjectures on possible existence of elliptic flowers with even more rich dynamics are also formulated there.</p>

However, all orbits of the core cannot have two consecutive collisions with one and the same regular component of the boundary. Therefore the absolute focusing condition does not play any role here. Observe also that in the papers dealing with general results on ergodicity of billiards only ergodicity in the entire phase space was studied, rather than ergodicity of dynamics on some subset of the phase space. However, the corresponding proofs can be applied word by word for our case, when the core is an ergodic component with a positive, but not full, measure.</p>

This wild rose billiard is the simplest one to built in a lab. Observe also that an experimenter can choose a relevant size of this devise.
Another simple example is the Narcissus billiard, which is built over a regular hexagons exactly at the same fashion as the wild rose was built over a regular pentagon (Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Elliptic Flowers: simply connected billiard tables with chaotic or non-chaotic flows moving around chaotic or non-chaotic cores" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">4 </span>Some Open Questions and Conjectures</h2>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As it was shown above, elliptic flower billiards demonstrate a large variety of behaviors, some of which have never been observed before, or even conjectured to exist. Therefore the first natural general question for the future studies of elliptic flowers is to understand how the changes in the dynamics of these billiards occur. Elliptic flower billiard can be specified by several parameters, all of which have a clear and visual geometric meaning. Therefore various types of bifurcations, which occur in these billiards, could be described in some clear geometric terms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Certainly, some trivial answers are immediately there, e.g. how a core may loose ergodicity by acquiring elliptic periodic orbit(s). However, a question on appearance of “vortices” with regular dynamics within chaotic flows in tracks is, certainly, of interest. Another question is whether immediately infinitely many vortices appear in chaotic tracks as a result of such transition. A general intuition suggests that it is likely the case. However, even in this situation it would be interesting to look at the structure of the set of vortices, and determine whether or not there is some kind of “coherence” between them.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another interesting issue, although probably essentially a technical one, is about construction of elliptic flowers with some specific properties for any convex polygon taken as a base. The results of the present paper were intentionally dealing with the simplest situation, when the base polygon is regular.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are still, at least theoretical, possibilities that there exist elliptic flowers billiards, which have some interesting properties not considered in the present paper.
Recall that in all the examples of multilayered elliptic flower billiards, studied in the present paper, all petals (regular components of the boundary) belonged only to the first or to the second layer of the base polygon.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, mostly even the simpler class of special one layer elliptic flowers was analysed. One may expect that the studies of elliptic flowers with the higher levels petals will bring some new examples of an unseen before behaviors, which are amenable to rigorous studies.</p>
