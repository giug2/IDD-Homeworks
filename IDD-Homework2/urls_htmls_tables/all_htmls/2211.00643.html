<p id="id18.id1" class="ltx_p">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental syndrome resulting from alterations in the embryological brain before birth. This disorder distinguishes its patients by special socially restricted and repetitive behavior in addition to specific behavioral traits. Hence, this would possibly deteriorate their social behavior among other individuals, as well as their overall interaction within their community. Moreover, medical research has proved that ASD also affects the facial characteristics of its patients, making the syndrome recognizable from distinctive signs within an individual’s face. Given that as a motivation behind our work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme to predict ASD in a certain individual based on their behavioral and facial features, embedding a merging process of both data features through facial feature extraction while respecting patient data privacy. After training behavioral and facial image data on federated machine learning models, promising results are achieved, with 70% accuracy for the prediction of ASD according to behavioral traits in a federated learning environment, and a 62% accuracy is reached for the prediction of ASD given an image of the patient’s face. Then, we test the behavior of regular as well as federated ML on our merged data, behavioral and facial, where a 65% accuracy is achieved with the regular logistic regression model and 63% accuracy with the federated learning model.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To start with, Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) could be defined as a complex neuro-developmental syndrome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> characterizing its patients by specific socially restricted and repetitive behavior. In other words, this disorder affects the social and behavioral traits of the patient, hence deteriorating their social behavior among other individuals, as well as their overall interaction within their community. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, ASD could be a result of alterations in the embryological brain pre-birth, making it a brain-based disorder affecting patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, ASD patients are distinguished from non-ASD persons not only by unique social and behavioral characteristics, but also by distinct facial features, as demonstrated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
According to the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, neuro-developmental disorders such as ASD can cause craniofacial abnormalities, or atypical facial features.
For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> prove that female and male individuals with higher levels of autistic traits are associated with less feminine and masculine facial structures, respectively. Furthermore, facial measurements taken in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> form a superb autism bio-marker. As a result, according to past medical studies, ASD sufferers have distinct facial traits that identify them from normal individuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some previous studies have proposed predicting whether a patient has ASD using Machine learning (ML), a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML is based on giving a computer program the ability to learn from data so that new predictions are made <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This learning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> could be divided into supervised learning, when data is labelled, or unsupervised learning, when the trainer learns patterns on unlabeled data. Machine learning applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> are majorly split into classification and regression, as the predicted value is either a discrete class/label or a continuous value, respectively. With the advancement of this science, a major application of ML has appeared in the healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and medical fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, specifically in disease prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Predicting ASD in children could help in the early diagnosis of this syndrome, which may be made possible using ML. However, data used for training such a machine learner is medical data, thus sensitive and classified as private to patients. Hence, to preserve the privacy of patients, we propose using a federated learning-based privacy-preserving framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to predict whether a patient has ASD or not, based on behavioral as well as facial image data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is based on combining privacy with regular ML. Training on data by ML algorithms occurs on distributed sites, called clients, where raw data is not shared among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, maintaining patients’ privacy. On the other hand, each client shares their local ML model weights, after learning its bulk of data, with a global aggregator who averages model parameters of all learned models by clients into a global model used for prediction. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works in the literature have used federated learning for predicting ASD using behavioral or facial image data. We, therefore, provide a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme for predicting ASD based on behavioral data and facial data separately, and then propose a merging method, through feature extraction, for both data sets to predict ASD according to a combination of both behavioral and facial traits.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several fields have proved the efficiency of applying regular as well as federated ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to predict certain real-world answers.
According to authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a major application of ML would be in the field of medicine and healthcare, such as predicting certain human diseases, traits, or syndromes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors tackle the issue of medical data scarcity and sensitivity, by proposing an additional level of privacy protection in medical imaging data through the use of federated privacy-preserving artificial intelligence. In federated machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, data is stored locally at each distributed client, training on it locally without moving the data outside the client devices, thus preserving the data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, authors proposed several machine learning as well as data mining methodologies for the sake of predicting heart diseases in patients, given their seriousness and the importance of early diagnosis of such diseases. Moreover, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced machine learning models for predicting Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements of patients. To add more, medical image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> plays a vital role in the clinical diagnosis of remarkable diseases and thus helps in the treatment process through early discovery of illnesses and disorders. Then, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> used deep learning methods to prove its effectiveness through disease prediction using neural network models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another effective main syndrome prediction using ML techniques would be Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is what we focus on in this paper.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, authors used ML classification models with 80% accuracy to predict whether a child is autistic or not based on behavioral data collected automatically from tablet games and eye-tracking data captured from face-to-face conversations with individuals, respectively. Also, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, eye-tracking information and image content was used to detect if an individual has ASD. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a new ML technique called Rules-ML that reveals autistic traits of cases while offering knowledge rules, achieving an accuracy higher than other regular ML strategies. Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> improved the measured accuracy in ASD classification, reaching a near 100% accuracy using the Multi-Layer Perceptron ML model on behavioral specific collected data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, who used the same behavioral dataset as we aim at using in this paper, found that using random forests, decision trees, and support vector machine algorithms results in around 90% accuracy, which improves with using feature selection methods. A remarkable dataset used in the literature was the ABIDE dataset, which consisted of MRI neuro-images in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Deep learning models were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to classify ASD vs. non-ASD patients, achieving a 70% accuracy. Using the same dataset of neuro-images, federated learning was used to associate an MRI image with an autistic individual or not <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, preserving the privacy of screened patients. However, none of the previous studies mentioned in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, has used federated learning to predict ASD based on behavioral data and facial features.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Notable applications for ML have been recently demonstrated in the fields of healthcare and medicine, specifically for predicting whether a certain patient carries a specific disease or not. In this context, we tackle the research problem of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on a set of input features or traits, based on two data formats separately. We then test the same problem within a combined approach, representing the different aspects of the disorder: behavioral and facial.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, given a set of behavioral features, including age and gender, in addition to behavior-specific traits, our federated learning model would predict whether the corresponding patient is autistic or not, having learned securely on the training data discussed in section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Datasets ‣ V Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>. Moreover, the second part of our work, which includes another aspect of ASD for prediction, is based on the facial features of a patient. Given a clear image of their face, showing all of their facial sides and characteristics, our model would also return a classification of ASD for the respective patient, while preserving the privacy of data and images. Third, given a combination of these features, behavioral as well as facial landmarks, our model would be able to accurately classify whether the individual is autistic or not, by extracting facial distances from facial images and combining these features with behavioral ones.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate each of the ML models used in our scheme, we measure each client’s accuracy value. This metric represents how far the predicted answer is from the actual classification, which is later aggregated into a global accuracy demonstrating the overall model’s performance. In the federated learning scheme, at each local training phase, data is split into 80% training data and the remaining 20% is kept for testing. Thus, once training is done, we measure the accuracy value by testing how many correct predictions are made in comparison with the real testing data having known labels or classes.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A Binary Cross-Entropy loss is used for calculating this accuracy value at each client locally. Cross-entropy loss measures the performance of a classification model having an output with a probability value between 0 and 1. Its value increases while the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. As our classification is binary; we only have two classes, ASD and non-ASD. We choose this loss function as a suitable measure. Hence, the higher the number of correct predictions, the lower the cross-entropy loss, and the higher the obtained accuracy value <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Acc_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml">c</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑐</ci><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.4.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">Acc_{i}</annotation></semantics></math> is.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle two significant aspects of ASD: a behavioral aspect, affecting the social behavior of an autistic patient within their community, and a facial aspect affecting the physical features of a patient’s face. We have discussed in previous sections how each of these aspects of ASD is used by machine learners. However, in this section, we discuss the process of merging both datasets, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> behavioral and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> facial image, motivated by testing the behavior of machine learning for the prediction of ASD depending on the combination of multiple human aspects (e.g. behavioral and facial). Then, given a combination of behavioral as well as facial features of a certain individual, our federated machine learning model would predict whether this individual has ASD or not, rather than using each of these aspects separately.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">Two datasets are used in this study: a behavioral dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> consisting of 610 instances, and a facial image dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> containing around 2900 images. Given that these two datasets do not have equal sizes, merging them is challenging. To tackle this issue, we built a random instance generator for behavioral data, producing instances with values in the ranges of those of real data. Then, we end up with around 2900 behavioral data instances, equally split among ASD and non-ASD classes, which is equal to the number of instances in the image dataset. Therefore, as the two datasets now have equal size, one behavioral data instance could be mapped to a facial image from the second dataset depending on their class.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">Another problem faced in this experiment would be merging datasets of different types: CSV dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and image dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. As we previously mentioned, medical research studies in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, have proved that ASD affects the facial characteristics of its patients, differentiating them from non-autistic individuals. To prove that, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> measure facial distances after examining the facial landmarks of the patient’s face in comparison to healthy patients. Hence, we rely on this work in order to merge both datasets by extracting certain features from each of the images in the dataset and mapping these facial features into one behavioral instance rather than mapping the whole image.</p>

This library works by detecting a face within the input image. Then, within each face detected, it recognizes the facial landmarks and specifies their coordinates depending on a pre-defined facial template represented in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ item 2 ‣ IV Multi-Aspect ASD Prediction Approach ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Thus, each point in the face would belong to a part of the face and have a unique number between 0 and 67, as well as coordinates (x, y). In Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ item 2 ‣ IV Multi-Aspect ASD Prediction Approach ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the facial template, points 0 through 16 represent the jaw points, the right and left brows are represented by points 17–21 and 22–26 respectively, the points 27–35 constitute the nose, 36–41 and 42–47 belong to the right and left eyes, 48–60 belong to the mouth points, and the points range 61–67 represent the lips. Therefore, to extract facial distances, representing facial features for each facial image in hand, we use Python Dlib to develop a program that takes as input the facial image dataset <a href="#S5.I1.i2" title="item 2 ‣ V-A Datasets ‣ V Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Then, for each image of an individual’s face in the dataset, such as the ones in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ item 2 ‣ IV Multi-Aspect ASD Prediction Approach ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the face is recognized, and then facial landmarks, including the brows, eyes, mouth, and nose, are distinguished through the plotted dots in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ item 2 ‣ IV Multi-Aspect ASD Prediction Approach ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Later, each plotted dot in the figure is characterized by a number in the range of 0-67, an abscissa ”x,” and ordinate ”y” in the 2D plane.

Therefore, after evaluation, these distances are added as features on top of the behavioral data features constituting the initial behavioral dataset. Then, our merged data ended up containing 22 features, 19 for the behavioral data and the remaining 3 for the facial distances. For the sake of testing in this experiment, data instances (rows) are merged randomly. To the best of our knowledge, no dataset combining both behavioral and facial features of ASD and non-ASD individuals has been found in the literature. For example, the first behavioral instance belonging to an ASD patient is mapped to the first ASD facial distance instance. This process is repeated till all of the instances are in hand. Due to the blurriness of some facial images, the Dlib program was unable to recognize some facial landmarks, which is why we ended up with 2677 data instances rather than 2940, the original dataset size.</p>

<p id="S5.I1.i1.I1.i2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to avoid bias in the training stage, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed. First, rows containing any missing answers are dropped, through which we end up with 487 data instances. Then, all text answers are transformed into numbered categories so that each class of answers would correspond to a number rather than words, given that all of the features at hand are categorical rather than continuous values. For instance, in the ”Gender” feature, a ”Male” answer is converted to 0 and a ”Female” answer is converted to 1, and so on. This method has been proven to enhance the learning ability of the ML model. Moreover, the feature ”ASD”, indicating whether the responder is autistic or not, or the class feature, is also categorical, so a ”Yes” answer is represented by 0 and ”No” by 1. It is worth mentioning that data is evenly split into both classes, to preclude any bias during training.
Finally, we save the pre-processed CSV data of responses into a python pickle file for faster and easier access later on in the training process in the FedML framework.</p>

The latter could then take as input an array corresponding to the image of a patient, and then return whether they have ASD or not based on the feature values, symmetric to their facial characteristics, within the input array. In the end, image array data is also saved into a python pickle file for the federated learning model to access and load faster and easier during the training process.</p>

As could be seen clearly, the accuracy increases with increasing the size of data per client, achieved by decreasing the number of clients per experiment. For instance, we first test with a number of clients C = 50 clients. After the distribution of data by the localFed framework, every client receives around 20 data instances, hence a 0.48 accuracy is achieved. When the number of clients is decreased to C = 10, then the maximum data size per client is increased to around 45 data instances per client, and the accuracy increases to 0.51. The highest accuracy, equal to 0.7, is achieved with C = 3 clients and 250 data instances per client.</p>

After the distribution of data by the localFed framework, every client receives around 58 data instances, representing facial images of autistic and non-autistic individuals. An accuracy of 0.5 is achieved. When we decrease the number of clients to C = 10, then the maximum data size per client is increased to around 290 data instances per client, and the accuracy increases to 0.53. Finally, as we decrease the number of clients to C = 3 clients and simultaneously increase the maximum data size to 250 data instances per client, the highest accuracy is achieved, equal to 0.6.</p>

In K-fold cross-validation, as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, data is partitioned into K separate equal-sized segments, called folds.

We use cross-validation in order to test whether higher accuracy values would be achieved than with a train-test split for the different machine learning models used. We experiment with K = 8 folds while shuffling data instances during data segmentation. As plotted in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ item 3b ‣ item 3 ‣ V-C Results ‣ V Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the accuracy results are slightly higher than those noted with the train-test split in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ item 3a ‣ item 3 ‣ V-C Results ‣ V Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning Scheme for Neuro-developmental Disorders: Multi-Aspect ASD Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.

As we decrease the number of clients to C = 10, the data size per client thus increases to 270 data instances per client, and the global accuracy also rises to 0.52. The latter keeps rising, while simultaneously increasing the number of data instances per client and decreasing the number of training clients. Then, the highest global accuracy of 0.63 is achieved with the lowest number of clients (C = 3) and the highest data size per client (1000 data instances). Therefore, the remarkable performance of our federated learning models on the different types of data would be that the number of clients is inversely proportional to the achieved global accuracy. Fewer clients lead to a higher data size per client, and then higher accuracy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Throughout this section, we discuss and analyze the results displayed in the previous section and give interpretations of how they were obtained. We also compare our results obtained for predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using our federated learning scheme to previous studies in the literature predicting the same disorder using regular ML models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">According to what we noted in the results, similar behavior is marked with training both ASD behavioral screening data and ASD facial image data on our federated learning framework and then with the merged data as well. The most notable behavior of the plotted results would be that the global accuracy increases by decreasing the number of clients in the federated learning experiment. This note would be interpreted by the fact that when we have a higher number of clients, fewer data instances are available to each client for local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, as any ML training is based on the data fed to its model, having fewer clients will eventually lead to a higher number of data instances, given that data is equally divided among clients. Thus, this redirects the trainer to a higher chance of training on larger data, and then a higher accuracy of its model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In comparison to regular ML models, higher accuracy is achieved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> for ASD screening behavioral data and Kaggle <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://www.kaggle.com/code/cihan063/autism-cnn-vgg16</span></span></span> for ASD facial image data. Concerning the latter, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was used, which achieved a 0.82 test accuracy, higher than the best accuracy we obtained with our federated learning model, equal to 0.6 with 3 clients being available. As for the work done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> for regular ML on ASD behavioral screening data, their accuracy noted was 0.9 with the artificial neural networks (ANN) model, which is also higher than the accuracy achieved in our experiments, which equals to 0.7 per 3 clients in the experiment.</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Surely, higher accuracy would be observed with regular ML in comparison to federated models, due to the distribution of data among clients. However, a higher level of data security and privacy is achieved when it comes to federated learning, which lacks regular ML training. This is essential in the application we are tackling, ASD prediction, given that the data being used is medical and personal, thus confidential within the screening center, and sensitive to leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, when it comes to merged data, higher accuracy is achieved with regular ML in comparison to federated ML, due to the distribution of data instances among local trainers, as also observed with the other types of data. Moreover, the highest accuracy achieved with regular ML and federated learning on the merged data is around 65% and 63% respectively. Given that the merged data, through which we conducted these experiments, is randomly generated and combined, these accuracy values could be acceptable. On the other hand, higher accuracy values would be achieved if the data, combining both behavioral and facial characteristics of ASD as well as non-ASD individuals, was real rather than randomly generated and mapped. Due to the fact that we are merging two datasets, we are adding additional meaningful features to the data. This should enhance the performance of the machine learner as it would make the data/labels more detailed and specific, which improves the learning accuracy. Hence, having real ASD/Non-ASD data containing behavioral data as well as facial distances, representing real patients, rather than randomly generated and correlated, would enhance the global accuracy obtained. Moreover, the machine learner’s performance would be enhanced with multi-aspect data given the medical proof we base our work on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Then, measuring the facial distances, the process we did through feature extraction, would be a major signal for differentiating ASD from non-ASD individuals. Therefore, the facial distance features we have added to the behavioral data should positively impact the learning process of a machine learner, especially if the facial images were real and directly related to the behavioral data instances. We would thus suggest having a dataset of facial images, with each image having a brief description of the ASD patient or normal individual, which would help more in enhancing the merging criteria for both behavioral and facial datasets. Hence, in brief, having real ASD/Non-ASD data containing behavioral data as well as facial details that belong to the same individuals, representing real patients, rather than randomly generated and correlated, would enhance the global accuracy obtained.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a new federated learning scheme for predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by special behavioral and social traits and medically proven to affect the facial traits of its patients. For this sake, we propose a prediction framework trained on two forms of data: the first consists of ASD screening behavioral data, made up of filled surveys on ASD patients’ social and personal traits, and the second consists of images corresponding to ASD as well as non-ASD individuals’ faces. Thus, given one of these two input datasets, our federated learning scheme would predict whether the individual is autistic or not, in a private prediction framework. We obtain remarkable results in comparison to previous regular ML models. Within our private training environment, a 71% accuracy was obtained for ASD prediction given behavioral data, while facial image ASD data produced a 62% accuracy. However, a higher number of data instances for both datasets in the learning process would have been more promising. For the sake of testing ASD data containing both behavioral and facial features, we tested a merged dataset via facial feature extraction using Python Dlib. Then, we study the behavior of the merged data on regular as well as federated machine learning, achieving a 65% and 63% accuracy, respectively. Therefore, we propose, as a future enhancement, testing the different models on real-world data instead of experimenting with synthetic data instances. We would also test the feasibility of using Federated Transfer Learning for the prediction of ASD as well as other medical conditions according to special recognizable characteristics and features of individuals.</p>
