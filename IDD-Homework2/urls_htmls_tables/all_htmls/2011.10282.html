<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">To exploit massive amounts of data generated at mobile edge networks, <em id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) has been proposed as an attractive substitute for centralized machine learning (ML). By collaboratively training a shared learning model at edge devices, FL avoids direct data transmission and thus overcomes high communication latency and privacy issues as compared to centralized ML. To improve the communication efficiency in FL model aggregation, <em id="id1.id1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</em> has been introduced to support a large number of simultaneous local model uploading by exploiting the inherent superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the heterogeneity of communication capacities among edge devices, over-the-air FL suffers from the straggler issue in which the device with the weakest channel acts as a bottleneck of the model aggregation performance. This issue can be alleviated by device selection to some extent, but the latter still suffers from a tradeoff between data exploitation and model communication. In this paper, we leverage the <em id="id1.id1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">reconfigurable intelligent surface</em> (RIS) technology to relieve the straggler issue in over-the-air FL. Specifically, we develop a learning analysis framework to quantitatively characterize the impact of device selection and model aggregation error on the convergence of over-the-air FL. Then, we formulate a unified communication-learning optimization problem to jointly optimize device selection, over-the-air transceiver design, and RIS configuration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed design achieves substantial learning accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, especially when channel conditions vary dramatically across edge devices.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The availability of massive amounts of data at mobile edge devices has led to a surge of interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">RESNET</span>]</cite> and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">NLP</span>]</cite>, at the edge of wireless networks.
Conventional machine learning (ML) requires a data center to collect all data for centralized model training. In a wireless system, collecting data from distributed mobile devices incurs
huge energy/bandwidth cost, high time delay, and potential privacy issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8970161</span>]</cite>. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called federated learning (FL) has emerged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">BGD</span>]</cite>. In a typical FL framework, each edge device computes its local model updates based on its own dataset and uploads the model updates to a parameter server (PS). The global model is computed at the PS and
shared with the devices. By doing so, direct data transmission is replaced by model parameter uploading. This significantly relieves the communication burden and prevents revealing local data to the other devices and the PS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the above advantages of FL, uplink communication overhead incurred during the iterative model update process is still a critical bottleneck for FL training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">BGD</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FEDSGD</span>]</cite>.
To improve the communication efficiency in FL,
over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">4305404</span>]</cite> has emerged to support analog model uploading from massive edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_DG</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Digital1</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Digital2</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhu2020onebit</span>]</cite>. In over-the-air model aggregation, edge devices concurrently transmit their local model updates using the same radio resources. The PS then computes the model aggregation from the received signal by exploiting the signal-superposition property of multiple-access channels. Compared with traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) protocols where multiple devices transmit using orthogonal channels, the bandwidth requirement or the communication latency of over-the-air computation does not increase with the number of devices, which largely relieves the communication bottleneck in FL. The first over-the-air model aggregation scheme appeared in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>]</cite>, where the authors show that the over-the-air computation leads to substantial latency reduction compared with the OMA schemes. The method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>]</cite> was later extended to one-bit over-the-air computation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhu2020onebit</span>]</cite>. Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>]</cite> maximized the number of participants in over-the-air model aggregation subject to a specific communication error constraint. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_DG</span>]</cite> investigated over-the-air computation error minimization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Digital1</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Digital2</span>]</cite> studied over-the-air model aggregation with gradient sparsification and compression in Gaussian channels and wireless fading channels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although over-the-air computation is envisioned to be a scalable FL model aggregation solution, it suffers from the straggler issue. That is, the devices with weak channels (i.e., the stragglers<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In the Computer Science literature, the word “stragglers” usually refer to devices with low <em id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">computation</em> capacities. Since the <em id="footnote1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication</em> aspect of FL is studied in this paper, we here use “stragglers” to denote edge devices with poor channel conditions.</span></span></span>)
dominate the overall model aggregation error since the devices with better channel qualities have to lower their transmit power to align the local models at the PS.
Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>]</cite> proposed to exclude the stragglers from model aggregation to avoid large communication error. Nevertheless, excluding devices reduces the training data size, which inevitably jeopardizes the convergence of FL.
To address this tradeoff, we must understand the impact of both the communication and computation aspects on the FL performance. However, analyzing the impact of device selection is difficult, letting alone the combined impact of device selection and communication error <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Friedlander2012</span>]</cite>. The existing work adopts heuristic metrics to simplify the over-the-air FL system design. For example, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>]</cite> approximates the learning performance by the fraction of exploited data and schedules the devices with strong and weak channels to participate alternately. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>]</cite>, the number of selected devices is used as a rough proxy of the FL performance and the communication-learning tradeoff is balanced by a manually tuned communication error constraint. These ad hoc solutions may not be able to fully characterize the FL training performance, leading to sub-optimal system designs.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as a key enabler of the next-generation wireless networks, can reduce energy consumption and improve spectral efficiency of wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wu2020intelligent</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9136592</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yuan2020reconfigurableintelligentsurface</span>]</cite>. Specifically, RISs are thin sheets comprising a large number of passive reflecting elements. By inducing independent phase shifts on the incident signals, the reflecting elements can proactively manipulate the propagation channels to overcome the unfavorable propagation conditions. Much research in recent years has focused on designing RISs to enhance traditional wireless communications. To name a few, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">CHUANGRIS</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">LIS_RZhang_discrete</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9110869</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ris_ref1_work4</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ris_ref2_work4</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ris_ref3_work4</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">RISMEC</span>]</cite> have investigated the optimization of RISs in various communication systems. As the objective of communication for over-the-air FL is different from that in traditional communication systems, there remains a need for efficient design for RIS-assisted over-the-air FL.
The recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_RIS2</span>]</cite> shows that the RIS can significantly mitigate the communication error in a general over-the-air computation task. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_RIS1</span>]</cite> made a first attempt in applying the RIS-assisted over-the-air computation method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_RIS2</span>]</cite> to FL and observes considerable learning performance improvement compared with FL without RISs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the current work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_RIS2</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_RIS1</span>]</cite> has demonstrated the effectiveness of RISs on improving the over-the-air model aggregation quality, the state-of-the-art design only focuses on the communication aspect, and thus cannot fully unleash the benefits of RISs in FL systems. Due to the aforementioned communication-learning tradeoff, it is necessary to jointly optimize RIS configurations and device selection in a uniform framework that can directly characterize the FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the advances of RISs in enhancing the over-the-air FL.
