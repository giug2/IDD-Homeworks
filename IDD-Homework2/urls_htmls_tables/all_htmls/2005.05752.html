<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed as an emerging paradigm to build machine learning models using distributed training datasets that are locally stored and maintained on different devices in 5G networks while providing privacy preservation for participants. In FL, the central aggregator accumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model. However, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership inference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable participants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy leakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means of defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework to create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from involving in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and unreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend against poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy techniques to prevent membership inference attacks. Numerical results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively deter poisoning and membership inference attacks, thereby improving the security of FL in 5G networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning has spawned a lot of useful applications, such as on-device learning and edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, due to communication delays and network bandwidth limitations in fourth-generation (4G) networks, mobile users holding smart devices with limited computing power cannot fully participate in distributed machine learning tasks. Fortunately, in the fifth-generation (5G) networks, bottlenecks attributed to communication latency and network bandwidth will be overcome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Therefore, attention can be focused on addressing the performance and efficiency issues of distributed machine learning can be addressed. Consequently, mobile devices will be able to participate in distributed machine learning. However, traditional distributed machine learning techniques require a certain amount of private data to be aggregated and analyzed at central servers during the model training phase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Such a training process would lead to potential privacy leakage for users in 5G networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address such privacy challenges, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a collaboratively distributed machine learning paradigm for mobile devices called Federated Learning (FL). FL involves the training machine learning models over devices <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We use the term ‘device’ throughout this article to describe entities in 5G networks, such as edge nodes, clients, smartphones, etc.</span></span></span> or siloed data centers while maintaining the training datasets locally without sharing raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The procedure of FL execution is divided into three phases: initialization, aggregation, and update phases. In the initialization phase, the central aggregator presents a pre-trained global model on a public dataset (e.g., MNIST<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span><a target="_blank" href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/</a></span></span></span>, CIFAR-10<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%C2%A0kriz/cifar.html" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html</a></span></span></span>), to each device. Following that, each device uses 5G networks to train and improve the current global model on the local dataset in each iteration.
In the aggregation phase, the central aggregator aggregates local model updates (i.e., gradient information) from the devices. In the update phase, the central aggregator aggregates all local model updates to generate a new global model for the next iteration. Both the devices and the central aggregator repeats the above process until the global model reaches a certain accuracy or optimal convergence. This paradigm significantly reduces the risks of privacy leakage by decoupling the model training from direct access to the raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL brings new application scenarios (e.g., edge computing and on-device learning) to devices in 5G networks, it still suffers from two critical threats: poisoning and membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Firstly, if the poisoning attack occurs, an unreliable device submits an “error update”, FL model would be “poisoned.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> A vicious attack will cause a failure in FL global model update. Secondly, in the case of the membership inference attack, since the intermediate gradients in training models always contain rich semantic information (e.g., model parameters), adversaries could exploit reverse engineering techniques to access some sensitive information (e.g., raw distribution of training data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, these vulnerabilities compel the
need to develop a secure and privacy-preserving framework for FL, where the global model updates can be aggregated more securely.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a secure FL framework that exploits the capabilities of smart contracts in blockchain to defend against poisoning attacks and also introduce local differential privacy techniques to mitigate inference attacks. Specifically, smart contracts allow a task publisher to reward participants who can provide well-trained local models for a specific FL task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The proposed framework establishes a marketplace to train FL models in an automated and anonymous manner for each participant (i.e., mobile device) through 5G networks. The local differential privacy technique provides robust defensive measures against membership inference attacks by adding well-designed noises to the model updates during the model training phase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Based on the proposed framework, a central aggregator can create a decentralized and trustless marketplace to eliminate the impact of overreliance on participants in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In 5G communication systems, task publishers can be typically deployed on edge nodes with sufficient storage and data processing capabilities, and mobile devices can easily access edge nodes to train local models.
The proposed framework creates a marketplace where participants that are skilled in solving FL problems can profit directly from smart contracts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

In FL, the local devices download the global model through 5G networks from the central aggregator, and then these devices train and improve the current global model by using their local raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Typically, each device trains its local model using Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and uploads the model updates (i.e., gradient information) to a central aggregator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has many promising applications in scenarios related to 5G networks, two threats have been identified as obstacles to its full-scale deployment. Noting that it is assumed that the central aggregator is not compromised or malicious, we enunciate the two threats as follows:</p>
<ul id="S2.I2" class="ltx_itemize">

Intentional malicious participants can submit wrong model updates, failing the update of the FL model. Unintentional malicious participants may upload model updates that have a negative effect on global model updates as they utilize low-quality training data. When the central aggregator aggregates these local model updates to update the global model, it eventually makes a poor accuracy or even useless global model.
All of these intentional or unintentional malicious behaviors may “poison” the FL
model. In a word, the current FL models rely on a trust mechanism, which makes it vulnerable to suffer from poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, existing studies show that adversaries can still initiate a membership inference attack to obtain sensitive information from the updated parameters associated with the local data. Specially, adversaries can utilize the sensitive information disclosed by network snooping attacks in 5G networks to threaten the privacy of FL model.</p>

However, such a method favours the gradient direction for updates uploaded from participants with high reputation value, which leads to the poor generalization ability of FL. Moreover, for local sensitive information leakage problems, existing studies show that the differential privacy technique is one of the best solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we introduce a local differential privacy technique to address the poisoning attack issues.
Guided by the above considerations, we outline the main objectives in the proposed FL framework.</p>

Note that the proposed framework can be also applied to other blockchain platforms. In this marketplace, honest participants can make profits by submitting correct solutions to FL problems. To ensure the security of framework, the central aggregator verifies the updates of local models based on smart contracts.
The need for mutual trust between participants in this framework is eliminated because the protocol uses cryptographic authentication to secure all transactions.</p>

In the proposed framework, participants add well-designed noises to their model updates by applying the local differential privacy technique. It utilizes some noise-adding mechanisms (e.g., Gaussian Noise Mechanism or Laplace Noise Mechanism) to secure model parameters. Therefore, even if adversaries gain access to the noise-adding gradient information, they cannot recover the original model parameters and local data.</p>

When a device succeeds in training a local model, it submits its local model updates to the Ethereum blockchain. All the Ethereum blockchain miners use the evaluation function in the smart contracts to evaluate all uploaded model updates and generate an average value of model quality for each uploaded model. We note that, similar to reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, a federated averaging algorithm (i.e., average aggregation) is used in the proposed framework. Participants use a differential privacy technique to add well-designed noise to the uploaded model updates. The high-quality (i.e., high accuracy) model updates with larger values (e.g., if it is larger than a given threshold determined by task publishers) will be sent to the central aggregator.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we addressed data privacy leakage issues related to ensuring secure FL in 5G networks. We proposed a blockchain-based framework to defend against poisoning attacks. In the proposed framework, a market is created to trade model updates based on smart contracts in blockchain to validate the model updates against poisoning attacks automatically. Additionally, we introduce the local differential privacy technique in smart contracts to prevent the membership inference attacks. Specifically, we add well-designed Gaussian noises to the model updates uploaded by the participants to defend against membership inference attacks. We validate our proposed security framework on two datasets, which yielded secure FL to 5G networks. The study has several open questions that need to be further investigated.
First, because the federated averaging algorithm is used to aggregate the model updates, we encounter unfair usage to certain devices. Second, efficiency issues arise since the use of deep learning algorithms increases the computational demands of the proposed system. Third, the more participants in the proposed framework, the greater the communication overhead, which in turn reduces the accuracy of FL. These are among the many issues that need to be addressed in the road to fair and efficient blockchain-based FL frameworks of the future.
