<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has become one of the essential components in Industry 4.0. As one of the critical indicators of ITS, efficiency has attracted wide attention from researchers.
However, the next generation of urban traffic carried by multiple transport service providers may prohibit the raw data interaction among multiple regions for privacy reasons, easily ignored in the existing research.
This paper puts forward a federated learning-based vehicle control framework to solve the above problem, including interactors, trainers, and an aggregator. In addition, the density-aware model aggregation method is utilized in this framework to improve vehicle control.
What is more, to promote the performance of the end-to-end learning algorithm in the safety aspect, this paper proposes an imitation learning algorithm, which can obtain collision avoidance capabilities from a set of collision avoidance rules.
Furthermore, a loss-aware experience selection strategy is also explored, reducing the communication overhead between the interactors and the trainers via extra computing.
Finally, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed imitation learning algorithm obtains the ability to avoid collisions and reduces discomfort by 55.71%. Besides, density-aware model aggregation can further reduce discomfort by 41.37%, and the experience selection scheme can reduce the communication overhead by 12.80% while ensuring model convergence.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of Industry 4.0 has profoundly promoted the transformation of the manufacturing industry to intelligence and automation, leading to the integration of information network technology and industry.
Meanwhile, as a critical part of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry also presents a tendency of intelligence and high integration.
More importantly, industry 4.0 allows manufacturing factories distributed in different regions to flexibly dispatch resources, which puts forward higher demand for transportation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
According to related research<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has an advantage in improving safety, efficiency and driving comfort.
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is an indispensable enabler for ITS, derived from advanced communication technology and emerging computing technology.
CAVs are expected to revolutionize future ITS to solve the issues of safety<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, efficiency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and sustainability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
With CAVs, traffic optimization can occur at different places, including automated intersection management<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to conventional traffic light control, automated intersection management aims to achieve higher throughput while ensuring the safety of vehicles.
The process of deciding the vehicle passing sequence is called scheduling.
The three main categories of existing scheduling policies are:
1) First-Come First-Served<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>: The first arrival vehicle is to be served firstly and entry to the intersection.
2) Optimization-Based<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>: The approaches try to minimize the average travel time for all vehicles passing the intersection, and the passing sequence may vary from the original.
3) Heuristic<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>: The optimal solution is not guaranteed, but it is sufficient to reach the immediate goal.
Because the actions taken by CAVs depend on the real-time driving conditions, which is a typical Markov Decision Process (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL) is suitable to address this issue.
Guan et al. proposed an RL-based method to centralized guide a fixed number of vehicles through the intersection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Wu et al. decoupled the relationship between the identity and driving information of vehicles and proposed a cooperative RL method to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Jiang et al. proposed a two-stage RL incorporating end-edge-cloud architecture to achieve global optimization among multiple homogeneous intersections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
However, low sample efficiency and limited safety performance bring a great difficulty to practical application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although some progress has been achieved in learning-based vehicle control at intersections, three problems still need to be solved at different intersections:
1) Isolation: For better vehicle control performance, it is essential to set a local center to assist the vehicle control, which means that some privacy-sensitive data is kept in a local center. Due to the privacy requirements of transport service providers, the data will not be transmitted to cloud nodes or other peer nodes.
2) Heterogeneity: Due to different traffic densities at intersections, the generated experience data drive the obtained RL model to show different capabilities for vehicle control optimization. Therefore, the conventional model parameter averaging may not meet the performance requirements at different intersections.
3) Scalability: As the number of CAV-enabled unsignalized intersections grows, data generated by the vehicles increases. Any learning-based algorithm with a centralized property may find it difficult to handle such data due to the incurred high computation and communication budget.</p>

Vehicles take the role of interactors, collect the surrounding information and map other vehicles from Physical-Lanes (PLs) to Cyber-Lanes (CLs). The reorganized information is upload to the experience pool as a piece of experience. The edge trainers sample the experience to train a local model via the proposed imitation learning algorithm. Then, several local models are collected at cloud nodes to be aggregated as a global model. Next, the global model is distributed to the edge trainer for subsequent updates. After several iterations, the final vehicle control model is obtained.</figcaption>

The bottom layer contains VIs requesting model downloading.
The middle layer includes several ETs equipped with GPU computing servers and experience databases.
The top layer has a global model aggregator.
The multiple connected VIs interact with the environment and individually upload experience data to the local database.
Each EI firstly generates a local model and acquires the experience from connected VIs. Then, based on the received data, each ET utilizes the local GPU computing ability to compute a local model. Next, the ET sends the local model to VIs for vehicle control and the CA for global model aggregation. Finally, the CA aggregates the models and sends the global model back to each ET.
The above steps are repeated until a satisfying global model is achieved.
The trained model in this work is specially developed to output the vehicles’ accelerations in response to the contextual information around the vehicle.</p>

Then, each ETs retrieves a global model from the CA and trains this model from its local model with the data collected from vehicles in the intersection area.
Following the local training of ETs, the updated weights and gradients are sent back to the CA. Finally, the CA aggregates the collected models from vehicles to construct an updated global model.
Furthermore, the final-trained models are distributed to the vehicles to ensure that vehicles pass through the intersection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The model trained in the above FL framework is the IL model for vehicle control.
It is used to obtain the vehicle control capability from the collision avoidance rules.
Both IL and RL depend on environment interaction. Unlike RL, which obtains the desired behaviors according to the hidden objectives, IL directly clones the desired behaviors.
IL can overcome the highly uncertain initial state and the sparse reward, which exists in RL and may lead to an exploration trap.
Thus, this part explains how to imitate the end-to-end vehicle control policy from existing rules.</p>

Space is the first factor, which can directly determine whether the collision has occurred.
As a second-order factor, time considers whether the vehicle will collide in the near future.
The acceleration indicates whether the collision will be avoided.
In this paper, the above factors are quantified as safety values (SV).</p>

This can also be analogous to IL.
This section introduces computing for communication, where extra computation is performed to reduce communication overhead.
In this section, the extra computation is placed on vehicles and edge nodes. Vehicles calculate the loss and compare the loss with thresholds given by edge nodes. Edge nodes produce a threshold for loss comparison.
Therefore, combined with the concept of computing for communication, a loss-aware experience selection strategy is proposed to throw away experience that helps to model training.</p>

The IL scheme is trained in four traffic densities (i.e. 300/900/1500/2100 veh/lane/hour).
The black lines in these sub-figures represent the set of collision avoidance rules described in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Collision Avoidance Rules ‣ III Density-aware federated imitation learning for vehicle control ‣ Density-Aware Federated Imitation Learning for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Unsignalized Intersection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>, and the results show that the rules can achieve good collision avoidance and traffic efficiency but poor driving comfort. This is because the safety value emphasized in this set of rules is to evaluate the surrounding danger degree according to space, time and acceleration, so as to avoid the collision, but it does not suppress the change of acceleration.
In addition, the results also demonstrate that the proposed IL algorithm can help the model learn the ability of collision avoidance and efficiency improvement from the rules.
Furthermore, only the model trained in low-density produces a small ratio of collisions in a high-density evaluation environment. This is because, in the low-density scene, the experience samples are concentrated in large inter-vehicle distances. Such sample distribution contributes to insufficient model training, which causes the model unable to cope with the high-density (i.e. small inter-vehicle distance) scenarios.
Moreover, compared with the rule, the policy obtained from IL can reduce the discomfort by 55.71%. It can be explained that rule-making inevitably introduces threshold trigger mode, and the state that has not yet triggered the threshold can not be fully mapped to the action. The model training helps complete the state-action mapping by gradually approaching the rule with a low learning rate.</p>

Obviously, RL is more dependent on samples, which can be easily found from the low-density training and high-density evaluation in Fig.<a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-C Results Analysis ‣ V Experiment ‣ Density-Aware Federated Imitation Learning for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Unsignalized Intersection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a>.

Models with higher collision rates are more conservative, but lead to better comfort and vice versa.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has proposed a FL-based vehicle control framework to address the problem of raw data interaction limitation. The framework contains three parts, interactors, trainers and an aggregator.
Under the framework, a density-aware model aggregation is proposed for intersections with different traffic densities.
Then, an IL algorithm is proposed for action cloning from a set of collision avoidance rules to improve the safety capability of end-to-end learning.
Furthermore, a loss-aware experience selection strategy is explored to reduce communication overhead via additional computation on interactors and trainers.
The extensive experiment reveals that the proposed IL algorithm obtains the ability to avoid collisions and reduces discomfort by 55.71%. The density-aware model aggregation in FL framework can further reduce discomfort by 41.37%, and the experience selection scheme can reduce the communication overhead by 12.80% while ensuring convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our main future work will be focused on the modeling and theoretical analysis of the relationship between the interactors and trainers in terms of communication and model training. Based on this analysis, we believe that it will help speed up the model training and significantly reduce the communication overhead.</p>
