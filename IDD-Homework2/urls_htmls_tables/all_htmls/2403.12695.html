<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in clinic disease diagnosis and medical image analysis. However, labeling medical images for segmentation task is tough due to the indispensable domain expertise of radiologists. Furthermore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of medical images, it is impractical to build a centralized segmentation dataset from different medical institutions. Federated learning aims to train a shared model of isolated clients without local data exchange which aligns well with the scarcity and privacy characteristics of medical data. To solve the problem of labeling hard, many advanced semi-supervised methods have been proposed in a centralized data setting. As for federated learning, how to conduct semi-supervised learning under this distributed scenario is worth investigating. In this work, we propose a novel federated semi-supervised learning framework for medical image segmentation. The intra-client and inter-client consistency learning are introduced to smooth predictions at the data level and avoid confirmation bias of local models. They are achieved with the assistance of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained collaboratively by clients. The added VAE model plays three roles: 1) extracting latent low-dimensional features of all labeled and unlabeled data; 2) performing a novel type of data augmentation in calculating intra-client consistency loss; 3) utilizing the generative ability of itself to conduct inter-client consistency distillation. The proposed framework is compared with other federated semi-supervised or self-supervised learning methods. The experimental results illustrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method while avoiding a lot of computation and communication overhead.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Image segmentation plays an important role in medical image analysis. Accurate and robust segmentation of lesions and organs can assist in diagnosing diseases and formulating treatment plans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Masood et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. With the development of computer vision, many deep learning methods are proposed for medical image segmentation and can achieve the state-of-the-art performance with sufficient labeled images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. However, it is difficult to obtain and maintain a large-scale labeled medical image dataset due to the privacy and sensitive characteristics of medical images. Furthermore, labeling medical images requires a large amount of labour, time and domain expertise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Razzak, Naz, and Zaib <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. In view of these facts, medical images exist in many isolated medical centers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and most of the medical images are unlabeled. Federated learning is an effective machine learning approach which allows isolated clients train a global model collaboratively without raw data exchange <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. By applying federated learning to medical image segmentation, each medical center can acquire a machine learning model with enough supervision and keep the privacy of raw data simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sheller et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Rieke et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning is suitable for medical image segmentation, each client possesses a large amount of unlabeled data which can not be utilized in normal supervised federated learning.
Numerous semi-supervised and self-supervised methods have been introduced to achieve exceptional performance on centralized datasets by leveraging a limited amount of labeled data in conjunction with a large number of unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kiyasseh et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang and Lukasiewicz <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. However, very few studies considered conducting semi-supervised or self-supervised learning in federated learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>; Chang et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite>. By integrating semi-supervised learning (SSL) into federated learning (FL) as federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL), <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jeong et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> firstly presented two application scenarios of FSSL which are Labels-at-Client and Labels-at-Server scenarios. In the Labels-at-Client scenario, both labeled and unlabeled data are available at local clients. In the Labels-at-Server scenario, labeled data are only available at server. Federated contrastive learning (FCL) is a federated self-supervised learning paradigm which applies contrastive learning to federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wen, Zhao, and Zhang <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. FCL can help clients collaboratively learn the image-level data representations by pre-training.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we concentrate on the Labels-at-Client scenario of federated semi-supervised learning. We propose a novel federated semi-supervised learning framework for medical image segmentation named FV2IC. A segmentation UNet model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> combined with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kingma and Welling <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> model is collaboratively trained in our framework. Our main idea is illustrated in Figure 1 and mainly includes following four aspects: (1) We consider using VAE model to extract latent global features of labeled and unlabeled medical images. Segmentation models based on CNN backbone such as UNet mostly focus on the features of local pixels in images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li, Zhang, and Yang <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. VAE model can extract the global features of medical images which can improve the segmentation performance effectively. (2) We introduce intra-client consistency learning in each client at the data level. The intra-client consistency loss between the images and the augmented images reconstructed by VAE is calculated and added to the supervised segmentation loss to smooth the prediction boundary. (3) The inter-client consistency learning is introduced to urge the predictions of global model to be consistent with the ensemble predictions of clients on the images generated by VAE model which can expand the feature search space. (4) The information of unlabeled images of each client is shared through the VAE model which reduces the interactions between clients and server and avoids a lot of communication overhead.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In medical image segmentation, labeling images requires a lot of time, labour and medical expertise. So semi-supervised learning is a favorable paradigm in medical image segmentation. The semi-supervised learning methods can mainly be divided into three categories including pseudo-label learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bai et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yao, Hu, and Li <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, consistency regularization training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Luo et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and entropy minimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Pseudo-label learning aims to employ the trained model to predict pseudo labels of unlabeled data and utilizing them as new labeled samples for further training. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">Yao, Hu, and Li</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed a confidence-aware cross pseudo supervision framework to enhance the quality of pseudo labels derived from unknown distributions. Another approach is to add unsupervised regularization such as consistency loss to the model. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">Luo et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> creatively introduced a task-level consistency loss and encourage the related data of two tasks in their framework to be consistent. Some research train the model with the principle of low entropy. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wang et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> designed a uncertainty-guided pixel contrastive loss serving as a low entropy regularization which encourages the representations of different geometric transformation to be consistent. Recently, prior knowledge of unlabeled data is used to assist in medical image segmentation. GBDL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang and Lukasiewicz <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> utilized a Bayesian deep learning framework which leverages prior knowledge to learn the conditional probability distribution of the model’s parameters under the joint distribution of data and labels.</p>

<div id="Sx2.SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A classical federated learning framework comply the agreement that all clients own labels of all training data. For some special scenarios such as medical image analysis, it is unrealistic to require that the data of each client is fully labeled. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jeong et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> firstly presented two application scenarios in FSSL which are Labels-at-Client and Labels-at-Server scenarios. A FSSL model named FedMatch is also proposed in this work which firstly trains the local model using labeled data and then urges the prediction of the model on unlabeled data to be consistent with other client’s ensemble prediction. Several studies have focused on building a federated semi-supervised framework for the pathology classification tasks including FedIRM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite> and RSCFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liang et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. FedIRM attempted to align the disease relation between labeled and unlabeled clients while RSCFed employed mean teacher method and update the global model by aggregating multiple sub-consensus models. Meanwhile, some federated semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed for medical image segmentation such as FedCons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and F2CMT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wen, Zhao, and Zhang <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. FedCons is a FSSL framework proposed for COVID region segmentation which leverages the global model to conduct unsupervised consistency learning in unlabeled clients and supervised learning in labeled clients. F2CMT is a FSSL paradigm for medical image segmentation which improves over the mean teacher mechanism with a cross-clients ensemble module. FDPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qiu et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> incorporate a feasible federated pseudo-labeling approach for unlabeled clients which utilize the embedded knowledge learned from labeled clients. One disadvantage of these methods is that the model performance is improved by designing complex federated semi-supervised protocols, but the communication overhead is greatly increased simultaneously. As far as we know, only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wen, Zhao, and Zhang <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Qiu et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> are designed for medical image segmentation tasks. So we also take another federated self-supervised learning paradigm which is federated contrastive learning (FCL) into consideration. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">Wu et al.</a></cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeyearpar">(<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed a FCL framework for cardiac image segmentation.</p>

<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce our proposed federated semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework. The framework is illustrated in Figure 2. In the training process of local models of each client, we firstly map the features of images to a low-dimensional space by training a VAE model using all images. To ensure the features obtained by VAE model are relevant to the segmentation task, the VAE encoder is combined with a UNet model to learn the segmentation task using labeled images. All images are input to VAE model to be reconstructed incorporating global data noise. Then the images and the reconstructed images will be input to the segmentation module. The intra-client consistency loss is calculated and added to the supervised segmentation loss. During the aggregation process, each client uploads the parameters of VAE and UNet model to server and sever aggregates the parameters with the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> algorithm firstly. And then inter-client consistency distillation is conducted to ensure the predictions of global model to be consistent with the ensemble predictions of clients on the generated images which can alleviate confirmation bias in calculating intra-client consistency loss.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In semi-supervised learning that relies on consistency regularization, consistency losses between original images and augmented images are added to supervised losses to smooth predictions at the data level. A novel intra-client consistency loss is introduced in our FSSL framework. Compared with traditional data augmentation in SSL, we use VAE to reconstruct images and regard the reconstructed images as augmented data. The local VAE model is aggregated through the FedAvg algorithm in each round to update the global VAE model. This aggregation introduces a certain level of global data noise into the images reconstructed by VAE. Consequently, the proposed augmentation strategy approximates the conditional probability distribution <math id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p(y|x_{r},z)"

<p id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.9" class="ltx_p">In semi-supervised training, the model will have a certain preference on labeled data which is easy to produce confirmation bias when calculating consistency loss. To overcome this problem, we introduce inter-client consistency distillation in aggregation process. Firstly, each client uploads its local VAE and UNet model to the server. Subsequently, the server aggregates the local models of clients to update the global VAE and UNet model through the FedAvg algorithm. After that, the server randomly samples fixed batches of noises <math id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="z" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">z</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑧</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.m1.1c">z</annotation></semantics></math> from Gaussian distribution <math id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N(0,1)" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.2" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml">N</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.1" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.2" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.2.1" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mn id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.2.2" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.2.3" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3"><times id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.1"></times><ci id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.2">𝑁</ci><interval closure="open" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.3.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.1.1">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2.2">1</cn></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx3.p1.2.m2.2c">N(0,1)</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implement our framework using PyTorch library on a NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. For fair comparisons, all the methods adopt a standard 2D UNet as the backbone. The framework is trained by Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 for UNet model and 0.001 for VAE model. Federated training is conducted 200 rounds and each client trains the local model for 1 epoch every round. The batch size is set to 24 including 4 labeled images and 20 unlabeled images. Four metrics are used to evaluate the proposed framework including dice coefficient, jaccard index, sensitivity and accuracy which are introduced in the appendix. As the cardiac images contain three segmentation classes, we average the metrics of three classes to be the final experiment results.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compared our framework with seven advanced federated semi-supervised or self-supervised methods including FCL, FedMatch, FedCons, FedIRM, F2CMT, RSCFed and FDPL.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Table 1 shows the quantitative comparison of our framework and other methods on ACDC 2017 and ISIC 2018. All the methods obtain the performance improvement through semi-supervised or self-supervised learning manners compared with the FedAvg method using only 20% labeled images in each client. The FedIRM, F2CMT, RSCFed and FDPL achieve higher performance than FedMatch, FCL and FedCons. It substantiates that more complicated protocols of federated learning or more advanced semi-supervised learning manners such as mean teacher are helpful to improve the performance of the methods. Our framework outperforms all the methods in four metrics. Compared to the best-performing model, our model still achieved the improvement of 1.40% in cardiac segmentation task and 0.35% in skin lesions segmentation task on the dice coefficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that some methods which attain better results such as F2CMT and RSCFed have high training and communication cost. In our framework, the semi-supervised learning including intra-client and inter-client consistency learning is conducted with the assistance of a VAE model which can extract the information of unlabeled images in each client. Only a lightweight VAE model requires to be transmitted between clients and server which avoids taking up a large number of computation and communication resources. Furthermore, cardiac segmentation is a multi-class segmentation task, whereas skin lesion segmentation is a single-class segmentation task. Our model achieves the best performance for both single-class and multi-class segmentation tasks. This further proves the robustness of our model in representing medical images.</p>

<div id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We perform a study on effectiveness of our approach under different labeled data percentage. Our framework is compared with the FedIRM which achieves the best performance in six compared methods and fully-supervised UNet using only 20% annotated images as trained data. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. The top red dotted line in the figure indicates the upper bound trained with 100% labeled data in each client. It can be observed that the performance gap between our method and fully-supervised UNet increases with less labeled data. This indicates that our method utilizing labeled data in an efficient manner especially under less labeled data circumstances. Furthermore, the performance of our model is consistently higher than the FedIRM method. An important observation is that the dice coefficient of our method closely approaches the upper bound when the labeled images account for 60%. It illustrates that our federated semi-supervised learning manner is effective and robust.</p>

The two cases above are the results of the segmentation on ACDC dataset while the two cases below are the results on ISIC dataset. The green, orange and blue regions denote the right ventricle, myocardium and left ventricle in cardiac MRI images. In the first case, there are all some false positives (red box) appeared in the segmentation results of four compared methods. However, our method has no false positives and possesses higher overlap ratio. In the remaining cases, the segmentation results own many false negatives (red box) compared with the GroundTruth. As for the result of our method, the false negatives are fewer and more details are preserved. These experimental results illustrate the effectiveness, robustness and generalization of our proposed method.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SS0.SSSx8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To explore the convergence of the model, we visualized supervised and unsupervised losses on ACDC dataset. We randomly selected two clients including client 1 and client 6. It can be seen from Figure 6 that both the supervised dice loss and unsupervised intra-client and inter-client consistency loss exhibit satisfactory convergence as the number of training rounds increases. The decrease of the inter-client consistency loss demonstrates that the global model can be optimized in uncertain feature space. This will greatly improve the generalization ability of the model and reduce the induction bias.</p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel federated semi-supervised learning framework for medical image segmentation. The intra-client and inter-client consistency learning are proposed to smooth predictions at the data level and alleviate the confirmation bias of local models. They are conducted with the support of a generative VAE model. VAE model can also extract the favourable features of medical images which can assist in segmentation task. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method and each component of our framework is effective. In the future, we will focus more on the safety of our framework. Some methods such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption will be added to our model to prevent the malicious agents from stealing private information of images.</p>
