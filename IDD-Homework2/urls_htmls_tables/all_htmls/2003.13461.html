<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Investigation of the degree of personalization in federated learning algorithms has shown that only maximizing the performance of the global model will confine the capacity of the local models to personalize. In this paper, we advocate an adaptive personalized federated learning (APFL) algorithm, where each client will train their local models while contributing to the global model. We derive the generalization bound of mixture of local and global models, and find the optimal mixing parameter. We also propose a communication-efficient optimization method to collaboratively learn the personalized models and analyze its convergence in both smooth strongly convex and nonconvex settings. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our personalization schema, as well as the correctness of established generalization theories.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With an enormously growing amount of decentralized data continually generated on a vast number of devices like smartphones, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> offers training a high-quality shared global model with a central server while reducing the systemic privacy risks and communication costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>)</cite>. Despite the classical approaches, where large-scale datasets are located on massive and expensive data centers for training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dean2012large</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2014scaling</span>)</cite>, in federated learning, the data and training both reside on the local nodes. This will ensure the privacy of the local data, while enabling us to learn from massive, not available otherwise, data on those devices. Not to mention the enormous reduction in communication sizes due to local training and data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, the ultimate goal is to learn a global model that achieves uniformly good performance over almost all participating clients. Motivated by this goal, most of the existing methods pursue the following procedure to learn a global model: (i) a subset of clients participating in the training is chosen at each round and receive the current copy of the global model; (ii) each chosen client updates the local version of the global model using its own local data, (iii) the server aggregates over the obtained local models to update the global model, and this process continues until convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mohri2019agnostic</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">karimireddy2019scaffold</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pillutla2019robust</span>)</cite>. Most notably, federated averaging (FedAvg) by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span></cite> uses averaging as its aggregation method over the local learned models on clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to inherent diversity among local data shards and highly non-IID distribution of the data across clients, FedAvg is hugely sensitive to its hyperparameters, and as a result, does not benefit from a favorable convergence guarantee <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">haddadpour2019convergence</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2020feddane</span>)</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">karimireddy2019scaffold</span></cite>, authors argue that if these hyperparameters are not carefully tuned, it will result in the divergence of FedAvg, as local models may drift significantly from each other. Therefore, in the presence of statistical data heterogeneity, the global model might not generalize well on the local data of each client individually <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">jiang2019improving</span>)</cite>. This is even more crucial in fairness-critical systems such as medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2019fedmd</span>)</cite>, where poor performance on local clients could result in damaging consequences. This problem is exacerbated even further as the diversity among local data of different clients is growing. This is depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Adaptive Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, where the generalization and training losses of the global models of the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>)</cite> and SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">karimireddy2019scaffold</span>)</cite> on local data diverge when the diversity among different clients’ data increases. This observation illustrates that solely optimizing for the global model’s accuracy leads to a poor generalization of local clients. To embrace statistical heterogeneity and mitigate the effect of negative transfer, it is necessary to integrate the personalization into learning instead of finding a single consensus predictor. This <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pluralistic approach</span> for federated optimization (FO) has recently resulted in significant research in personalized learning schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">eichner2019semi</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">smith2017federated</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dinh2020personalized</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mansour2020three</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">fallah2020personalized</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2020lotteryfl</span>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of these observations, and to balance the trade-off between the benefit from collaboration with other users and the disadvantage from the statistical heterogeneity among different users’ domains, in this paper, we propose an <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">adaptive personalized federated learning</span> (<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">APFL</span>) algorithm which aims to learn a personalized model for each user that is a mixture of optimal local and global models. We theoretically analyze the generalization ability of the personalized model on local distributions, with dependency on mixing parameter, the divergence between local and global distributions, as well as the number of local and global training data. To learn the personalized model, we propose a communication efficient optimization algorithm that adaptively learns the model by leveraging the relatedness between local and global models as learning proceeds. As it is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Adaptive Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, by progressively increasing the diversity, the personalized model found by the proposed algorithm demonstrates a better generalization compared to the global models learned by FedAvg and SCAFFOLD. We supplement our theoretical findings with extensive corroborating experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed personalization schema over the global and localized models of commonly used FO algorithms.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The number of research in federated learning is proliferating during the past few years. In federated learning, the main objective is to learn a global model that is good enough for yet to be seen data and has fast convergence to a local optimum. This indicates that there are several uncanny resemblances between federated learning and meta-learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">finn2017model</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">nichol2018first</span>)</cite>. However, despite this similarity, meta-learning approaches are mainly trying to learn multiple models, personalized for each new task, whereas in most federated learning approaches, the main focus is on the single global model. As discussed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kairouz2019advances</span></cite>, the gap between the performance of global and personalized models shows the crucial importance of personalization in federated learning. Several different approaches are trying to personalize the global model, primarily focusing on optimization error, while the main challenge with personalization is during the inference time. Some of these works on the personalization of models in a decentralized setting can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">vanhaesebrouck2017decentralized</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">almeida2018djam</span></cite>, where in addition to the optimization error, they have network constraints or peer-to-peer communication limitation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">bellet2017personalized</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zantedeschi2019fully</span>)</cite>. In general, as discussed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kairouz2019advances</span></cite>, there are three significant categories of personalization methods in federated learning, namely, local fine-tuning, multi-task learning, and contextualization. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yu2020salvaging</span></cite> argue that the global model learned by federated learning, especially with having differential privacy and robust learning objectives, can hurt the performance of many clients. They indicate that those clients can obtain a better model by using only their own data. Hence, they empirically show that using these three approaches can boost the performance of those clients.
In addition to these three, there is also another category that fits the most to our proposed approach, which is mixing the global and local models.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Local fine-tuning:</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The dominant approach for personalization is local fine-tuning, where each client receives a global model and tune it using its own local data and several gradient descent steps. This approach is predominantly used in meta-learning methods such as MAML by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">finn2017model</span></cite> or domain adaptation and transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ben2010theory</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mansour2009domain</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pan2009survey</span>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">jiang2019improving</span></cite> discuss the similarity between federated learning and meta-learning approaches, notably the Reptile algorithm by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">nichol2018first</span></cite> and FedAvg, and combine them to personalize local models. They observed that federated learning with a single objective of performance of the global model could limit the capacity of the learned model for personalization. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">khodak2019adaptive</span></cite>, authors using online convex optimization to introduce a meta-learning approach that can be used in federated learning for better personalization. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">fallah2020personalized</span></cite> borrow ideas from MAML to learn personalized models for each client with convergence guarantees. Similar to fine-tuning, they update the local models with several gradient steps, but they use second-order information to update the global model, like MAML. Another approach adopted for deep neural networks is introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">arivazhagan2019federated</span></cite>, where they freeze the base layers and only change the last “personalized” layer for each client locally.
The main drawback of local fine-tuning is that it minimizes the optimization error, whereas the more important part is the generalization performance of the personalized model. In this setting, the personalized model is pruned to overfit.</p>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another view of the personalization problem is to see it as a multi-task learning problem similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">smith2017federated</span></cite>. In this setting, optimization on each client can be considered as a new task; hence, the approaches of multi-task learning can be applied. One other approach, discussed as an open problem in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kairouz2019advances</span></cite>, is to cluster groups of clients based on some features such as region, as similar tasks, similar to one approach proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mansour2020three</span></cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An important application of personalization in federated learning is using the model under different contexts. For instance, in the next character recognition task in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">hard2018federated</span></cite>, based on the context of the use case, the results should be different. Hence, we need a personalized model on one client under different contexts. This requires access to more features about the context during the training. Evaluation of the personalized model in such a setting has been investigated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wang2019federated</span></cite>, which is in line with our approach in experimental results in Section <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:sec:exp</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liang2020think</span></cite> propose to directly learn the feature representation locally, and train the discriminator globally, which reduces the effect of data heterogeneity and ensures the fair learning.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Personalization via model regularization:</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another significant trial for personalization is model regularization. There are several studies to introduce different personalization approaches for federated learning by regularize the difference between the global and local models. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">hanzely2020federated</span></cite> try to introduce a new formulation for federated learning where they add the regularization term on the distance of local and global models. In their effort, they use a mixing parameter, which controls the degree of optimization for both local models and the global model. The FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>)</cite> can be considered a special case of this approach. They show that the learned model is in the convex haul of both local and global models, and at each iteration, depend on the local models’ optimization parameters, the global model is getting closer to the global model learned by FedAvg. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">huang2020personalized</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dinh2020personalized</span></cite> also propose to use the regularization between local and global model, to realize the personalized learning. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">shen2020federated</span></cite> propose a knowledge distillation way to achieve personalization, where they apply the regularization on the predictions between local model and global model.

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Personalization via model interpolation:</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Parallel to our work, there are other studies to introduce different personalization approaches for federated learning by mixing the global and local models.
The closest approach for personalization to our proposal is introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mansour2020three</span></cite>. In fact, they propose three different approaches for personalization with generalization guarantees, namely, client clustering, data interpolation, and model interpolation. Out of these three, the first two approaches need some meta-features from all clients that makes them not a feasible approach for federated learning, due to privacy concerns. The third schema, which is the most promising one in practice as well, has a close formulation to ours in the interpolation of the local and global models. However, in their theory, the generalization bound does not demonstrate the advantage of mixing models, but in our analysis, we will show how the model mixing can impact the generalization bound, by presenting its dependency on the mixture parameter, data diversity and optimal models on local and global distributions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond different techniques for personalization in federated learning, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kairouz2019advances</span></cite> ask an essential question of “<span id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">when is a global FL-trained model better?</span>”, or as we can ask, when is personalization better? The answer to these questions mostly depends on the distribution of data across clients. As we theoretically prove and empirically verify in this paper, when the data is distributed IID, we cannot benefit from personalization, and it is similar to the local SGD scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">stich2018local</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">haddadpour2019local</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">haddadpour2019trading</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">woodworth2020local</span>)</cite>. However, when the data is non-IID across clients, which is mostly the case in federated learning, personalization can help to balance between shared and local knowledge. Then, the question becomes, what degree of personalization is best for each client? While this was an open problem in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mohri2019agnostic</span></cite> on how to appropriately mix the global and local model, we answer this question by adaptively tuning the degree of personalization for each client, as discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Adaptive 𝛼 update ‣ 4 Optimization Method ‣ Adaptive Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>, so it can perfectly become agnostic to the local data distributions.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a standard federated learning scenario, where the goal is to learn a global model for all devices cooperatively, the learned global model obtained by minimizing the joint empirical distribution, either by proper weighting or in an agnostic manner, may not perfectly generalize on local users’ data when the heterogeneity among local data shards is high (i.e., the global and local optimal models might drift significantly). However, by assuming that all users’ data come from the (roughly) similar distribution, it is expected that the global model enjoys a better generalization accuracy on any user distribution over its domain than the user’s own local model. Meanwhile, from the local user perspective, the key incentive to participate in “federated” learning is the desire to seek a reduction in the local generalization error with the help of other users’ data. In this case, the ideal situation would be that the user can utilize the information from the global model to compensate for the small number its local training data while minimizing the harm induced by heterogeneity among each user’s local data and the data shared by other devices. Obviously, when the local distribution is highly correlated with global distribution, the global model is preferable; otherwise, the global model might be ineffective to be employed as the local model. This motivates us to mix the global model and local model with an adaptive weight as a joint prediction model, namely, the personalized model.</p>

Moreover, their results only apply to very simple loss functions, e.g., absolute loss or MSE loss, while we consider squared hinge loss in the classification case. Analogous to multiple domain theory, we derive the multi domain learning bound based on the divergence of source and target domains but measured in absolute distance, <math id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="\|\cdot\|_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1b"><mo rspace="0em" id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1.1">∥</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1.2">⋅</mo><msub id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1.3"><mo lspace="0em" id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1.3.2">∥</mo><mn id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1.3.3">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark2.p1.3.3.m3.1c">\|\cdot\|_{1}</annotation></semantics></math>.

In general, when the local and global data distributions are well aligned, one would intuitively expect that the optimal choice for the mixing parameter would be small to gain more from the data of other devices. On the other side, when local and global distributions drift significantly, the mixing parameter needs to be closed to one to reduce the contribution from the data of other devices on the optimal local model. In what follows, we propose a local descent approach to optimize both objectives simultaneously.</p>
