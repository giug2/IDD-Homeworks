<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a sought-after distributed machine learning architecture, offering the advantage of model training without direct exposure of raw data. With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel light-weight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We also dive into the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with Non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. The experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of internet of things (IoT), edge devices such as mobile devices, smart sensor and smart meters are enhancing the productivity and efficiency of data collecting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which facilitates the development of intelligent future. Machine learning models are widely used in intelligent applications to obtaining insights from enormous data on edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the abuse of intelligent applications brings recent privacy concerns from public about the unrestrained data collection.
European Union has announced multiple regulations to restrict the private data exposure and acquisition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Private data should not be shared with third parties, and transmitting sensitive information over the internet could expose it to cybersecurity threats.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is investigated and becoming a popular solution that allows machine learning model requesters/owners get model trained without having to collecting data from edge devices at unintended cost and risks. In a typical federated system, a model is trained across multiple trainers who have the training data. An aggregator will collect and aggregate the trained models. Then the aggregated model is sent back to trainers for another round of training. As the the data on each trainer are never shared, the privacy can be preserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The distributed architecture of FL brings trust issues among the model requester and trainers. Malicious trainers may upload random models to spoil the global model, and lead to failure of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Specially, in edge computing context, edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to the model training because of limited supervision and low security robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Incorporating blockchain modules in to FL phases can be helpful to validate the models without having to build a trustable third-party to do authentication. The smart contract deployed on the blockchain system can ensure the quality of model updates, avoiding malicious trainers that attempts to damage the global model. The tractability of blockchain storage also provides transparent model update and training log to all participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In most Blockchain-empowered FL (BFL) work in edge computing, edge devices are often set as the peers in blockchain modules based on intuition that edge devices are trainers and thus have to share parameters via blockchain. However, the blockchain module imposes extra computation and communication burden to edge devices while edge devices, e.g. micro computers or sensors have limited computation power. Therefore it is not practical to involve those edge devices into blockchain modules such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> did in their work. Especially when Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is used as the consensus mechanism in the blockchain module <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, tremendous computation costs are applied to edge devices, who are supposed to focus resources on model training instead of solving meaningless hash puzzles in PoW.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, most BFL framework are proposed under the context where only one aggregator exits which can not reflect the common real-word use cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In large-scale edge computing systems, where edge devices are broadly distributed in wide range of spaces, edge devices are usually connected through multiple edge servers, such as network access points or base stations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we address these under-explored problems by proposing a novel architecture of blockchain-FL framework in edge computing context where multiple edge servers are serving as multiple aggregators.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, due to the heterogeneity of data holding by edge devices, the models converged on local data will lost generalizability which will ruin the performance of aggregated models on unseen data. We design a simple demonstrative experiment to illustrate the problem. We create an aggregator with 30 trainers holding FashionMnist dataset in heterogeneous distribution. The conventional way for FL training is that each trainer trains the model on their local data till convergence. We compare this strategy with an early stopping strategy that all trainers will do at most 10 epochs of training. As shown in Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Blockchain-empowered Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture in Edge Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, “early stop” strategy finished 20 rounds aggregation with 36% less time, but achieved better final performance. By stop the training after 10 epochs on each trainer, “early stop” went through 62% less data samples which saves significant computation resources. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Blockchain-empowered Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture in Edge Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the performance of two strategies after each aggregations. It is crucial for trainers and aggregators try to obtain the best model as usually the reward is associated with the model performance. In this paper, we solve this problem in a more challenging context that multiple aggregators with varied number of trainers exist in BFL.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most of existing BFL frameworks in edge computing are composed in two layers i.e. one model owner/aggregator and multiple model trainers as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Related Work ‣ A Blockchain-empowered Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture in Edge Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

Cui et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed similar three layer architecture as in this paper where there are also multiple edge nodes. But these edge nodes are working as trainers and the models are still aggregate by one central server, which is still not a multi-aggregator architecture.
Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> utilizes distributed aggregation in vehicular network which allows multiple aggregators in the vehicular network sharing models trained by connected vehicles. But the author did not study the heterogeneous problem among the aggregators and Proof of Accuracy (PoA) will make the blockchain module become centralized very fast. Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> also considers multiple edge servers as aggregators similar to this paper, but we do not include edge devices into the blockchain mining to save resources on edge devices. Lee and Kim <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> also study multi-aggregator with heterogeneous data distribution and design local aggregation and global aggregation phases in their proposed architecture. Though the terms are similar in this paper, FL is not conducted within edge computing scope and we have totally different blockchain design and aggregation formulation.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Because maintaining blockchain impose extra computation and storage cost to edge devices, researchers have been trying to propose novel consensus mechanisms in edge computing context as substitutes of Proof of Work (PoW) which is current the most common consensus mechanism.

Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> focus on the communication cost of blockchain system, they designed a DRL algorithm to optimize the communication bandwidth allocation. Lin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> propose a streamline-based shard transmission mechanism for BFL in transportation system, where DRL is adopted to to automate the selection of parameters of vehicular shards. Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> propose an asynchronous federated learning scheme by adopting DRL for node selection to improve the efficiency.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with traditional federated learning architecture where the situation is straightforward that the only aggregator will aggregate the collected models and derive a global model, in multi-aggregators setting, we have to design a consensus among all aggregators to elect one aggregator at each global aggregation round to do model aggregation as well as to make it synchronized and verified by all other aggregators.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A common consensus mechanism is Proof-of-Work (PoW). However it will waste considerable energy on solving meaningless hash puzzle. As raised by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the energy consumed on hash puzzle can be saved for executing federated learning tasks. On the other hand, due to lack of trust and delay or disturb of communication among edge servers, a byzantine fault tolerant consensus is desired in this paper’s scenario. Castro and Liskov <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposed a practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT) that can achieve final consensus after three specific message propagation. PBFT is now commonly used in blockchain systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, PBFT does not includes the miner election as required in our proposed architecture. In addition, a corresponding incentive mechanism should exist in the consensus mechanism to motivate the edge servers to work hard for providing helpful local models that benefit the global model.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To be chosen as miners, edge servers are incentivized to enhance their training outcomes through local aggregation. Within the distributed learning framework, the Non-IID data distribution and CPU speed vary among trainers, leading to a natural variation in model quality. However, classic FL architectures often weight the model based on the data volume of each trainer, neglecting the actual quality of the training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, these architectures tend to wait for the slowest trainer to complete its training before proceeding with aggregation. We address this practical issue in this section, that the model aggregation should not only take trainers’ data amount as weight, but also take account of the performance of their actual trained model.</p>

The challenge of the RL task is how to make the past experience from different edge servers useful for others as they are within different RL environment settings, i.e. varied number of connected edge devices, with varied data amount and training speed on each. The same parameter setting for different edge server may result in totally different outcomes. MASB-DRL addresses this challenge through incorporating the edge servers status into agent training status.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we evaluate the performance of proposed Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture on 3 common real-world datasets. We then evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-Agent with Shared Buffer Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm (MASB-DRL) by comparing it with two baselines. We finally evaluate the robustness of Performance-based Byzantine Consensus Mechanism (PBCM).</p>

We can see all federated learning architecture show slightly lower performance than traditional centralized training schema. This is because the gradients can not be accurate propagated to all data samples and the Non-IID data distribution brings challenge on generalizability of trained models. As image classification on CIFAR-10 is the hardest task among all three, the decentralized baselines show the most accuracy gap to the centralized training architecture on CIFAR-10. data Among all FL architecture, our proposed BMA-FL can achieve the best performance. This demonstrates our proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm MASB-DRL can effectively learn better training strategies in BMA-FL, aiding the aggregators in BMA-FL better decide local aggregation frequency and balance the weights for the collected models at local aggregation.</p>

It is obvious that our proposed BMA-FL shows faster convergence speed than FedAvg and “Random”. More specifically, on FashionMNIST dataset, BMA-FL used averagely only 20 global aggregation rounds to reach the performance of FedAvg at 25th global aggregation round, which means BMA-FL is 20% faster than FedAvg on FashionMNIST dataset. In addition, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, where image classification is much harder than MNIST and FashionMNIST, BMA-FL used only 14 aggregation rounds to reach the performance of FedAvg at 20th global aggregation round, which means BMA-FL is 30% faster than FedAvg on CIFAR-10 dataset. Taking all three dataset into account, we can conclude that harder task will benefit more from BMA-FL achitecure.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studied multi-aggregator federated learning problem in edge computing which is an under-explored topic. We proposed Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture (BMA-FL) to fill the gap. BMA-FL addressed the challenge that The limited resources on edge devices make them not feasible for carrying the load for both model training and blockchain mining, which is often overlooked in related work. To this end, we proposed a Performance-based Byzantine Consensus Mechanism (PBCM) which is light-weight and secure for edge servers to choose honest one for global model aggregation. Due to the heterogeneity problem that edge devices have heterogeneous Non-IID data distribution and training speed, traditional model aggregation methods tend to underperform in the scenario. We proposed Multi-Agent with Shared Buffer Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm (MASB-DRL) that enables edge servers learning the best training strategy from past experience. Empirical assessments indicated that BMA-FL surpasses benchmark models in terms of both training efficiency and end model performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PBCM and MASB-DRL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our study does present areas for potential enhancement and further exploration. Firstly, data offloading from edge devices to servers could benefit from a refined strategy, determining consistent data quantities rather than the binary decision of uploading all or none of the untrained data each round. Secondly, while our approach to making the experience buffer shareable among edge servers involved integrating two server descriptive variables into the experience instance, this can be further optimized. Lastly, we still used traditional average strategy in global aggregation, which can also be further optimized with learnable aggregation strategies.</p>
