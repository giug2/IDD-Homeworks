<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables distributed computation of machine learning models over various disparate and remote data sources, without requiring to transfer any individual sample to a centralized location. This results in improved model generalization and efficient scaling of computation as more sources and larger datasets are added to the federation. Nevertheless, recent membership inference attacks show that private or sensitive personal data can sometimes be leaked or inferred when model parameters or summary statistics are shared with a central site, requiring improved security solutions. In this work, we propose a framework for <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">secure</em> FL using fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE). Specifically, we use the CKKS construction, an approximate, floating point compatible scheme that benefits from ciphertext packing and rescaling. In our evaluation on a large-scale brain MRI dataset, we use our proposed secure FL framework to train a deep learning model to predict a person’s age from distributed MRI scans, a common benchmarking task, and demonstrate that there is no degradation in the learning performance between the encrypted and non-encrypted federated models.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning and traditional machine learning methods are now widely applied across all fields of medical imaging to facilitate image reconstruction and enhancement, automated segmentation and labeling of key structures, as well as computer aided diagnosis, pathology detection, disease subtyping, and predictive analytics (e.g., modeling future recovery or decline). In brain imaging in particular, there is great progress in automated diagnostic classification and subtyping of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, to assist in patient management and monitoring, and to screen patients for eligibility for clinical trials. Some recent MRI-based classifiers have merged data from over 80,000 individuals for diagnostic classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Even so, for many tasks, publicly available training data is limited, and vast repositories of raw neuroimaging data may not be shared due to privacy concerns, as well as ethical and legal limitations on data sharing, and patient consent. In addition to local regulations that may govern or restrict data transfer, national and international laws, such as HIPAA or the General Data Protection Rule (GDPR) in Europe, severely limit the transfer of personal data across organizations and countries, even when data is anonymized as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning offers a distributed machine learning training paradigm to perform computations on diverse datasets that may be geographically distributed across the world, or on multiple servers, by relaxing the need to centralize the data in any single location for training or testing. A federation consists of a set of learning sites (i.e., learners/clients), each performing computations on its local data, and a centralized controller that integrates information from the participating sites, and coordinates the distributed computation. The ability to learn from multiple remote data sources results in models that can generalize better than the models learned from a specific data source, while maintaining computational efficiency as the number of sites scales and datasets at each site increase in size and content.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several recent papers tackle the problem of learning over distributed neuroimaging datasets. The ENIGMA Consortium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has coordinated meta-analyses of statistical models from over 150 neuroimaging centers in 45 countries. Typically, parameters from models are estimated locally, and parameter estimates are shared with a central site for meta-analysis.
Plis et al. (2016) introduced the COINSTAC system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> for decentralized processing of medical imaging data, allowing iterative computations, such as N-site PCA and ICA, fitting models to local datasets and merging parameters without transferring raw data.
Recent workshops on distributed and collaborative learning in biomedical imaging have focused on federated gradient averaging and multivariate linear modeling<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, learning from non-IID or unbalanced data at the participating sites<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, as well as adaptive weighting, asynchronous and semi-synchronous schemes that allow distributed learning in heterogeneous computing environments<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Other works focus on <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized</em> FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, where models are trained on distributed data but customized to perform well on a specific dataset; in this context, the federation offers an auxiliary source of relevant data for a given task, similar in spirit to transfer learning or pre-training on auxiliary tasks.
A similar approach based on Batch-Normalization (BN) has also been proposed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where only the BN-transformation parameters are shared during federated training, leading to learn a per-site model instead of a single global model, and thereby accounting for heterogeneity via model personalization.
Frameworks addressing fairness in federated biomedical applications<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have also been proposed through the decomposition of locally learned representations into target and sensitive codes. FL has been applied in real-world collaborative medical settings, such as the Breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) tool, where a federated model for the breast density classification problem was jointly trained across seven medical institutions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several authors have tackled data privacy and security aspects of distributed computations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Andreux et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> noted that even in FL, sharing aggregated statistics or model parameters can leak sensitive personal information. In a study of membership inference attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, we recently showed that it is possible to infer if a person’s data was used to train a model given only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box), and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. We correctly identified whether specific MRI scans were used in model training with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions. Differential privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> constitutes another proposed privacy-preserving data mining solution for biomedical settings<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, as already shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, even though it is an effective mechanism, it can lead to significantly increased model training costs and large drops in model performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The focus of our work is on the problem of predicting subjects’ brain age from 3D MRI scans in an encrypted federated learning environment. Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE) from brain structural MRIs is a challenging biomedical task, which is an important biomarker to assess and diagnose an individual’s risk of neurological diseases. The age value difference between the

Recently, this task has been used for <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">benchmarking</em>, as ground truth (the person’s real age) is known.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning was introduced in the seminal work of McMahan et al. (2017) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The task was to jointly train machine learning models over mobile phones using the privately held user data without any data ever leaving the training device. The originally proposed algorithm, <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Average</span> (FedAvg), assigns a fixed number of training steps to each participating device and periodically aggregates the locally trained models to compute a new community (global) model. This aggregation (synchronization) point is expressed in terms of federation rounds. Once the new community model is computed, it is distributed to all the devices and a new federation round begins. The FedAvg algorithm has been widely adopted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In our work, we employ the FedAvg algorithm to distributively train our encrypted federated model (see section <a href="#S5" title="5 Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption ‣ Secure Neuroimaging Analysis using Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). However, our architecture is general and supports other training policies.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the federated learning setting, the number of participating learners, and the amount of data, two distinct federated learning environments are commonly considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>: the <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device</span> and the <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</span> environments. The cross-device environments characterize federations with a large number of participating learners, such as internet of things (IoT) and mobile devices, with each learner holding a relatively small amount of data, and low client availability. The cross-silo federated environments consist of a relatively small number of learners, such as organizations and data centers, with larger amounts of data and high client availability. Moreover, depending on the execution workflow and computing plan, different federated learning topologies may exist<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> with <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized</span> and <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decentralized</span> being the two most prominent. In the centralized case, a central entity exists (federation controller), which is responsible to coordinate the participating learners and aggregate their local models, while in the decentralized case the learners can communicate directly to each other (peer-to-peer) and aggregate models without the presence of a centralized controller. In the biomedical domain that we investigate in this work, our primary focus is on the cross-silo, centralized federated learning environments, such as a network of hospitals or a research consortium, that want to collaboratively train a machine learning model over their privately owned biomedical data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has also been used in various federated settings in recent years.
Zhang et al. present BatchCrypt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, a system for secure FL in the cross-silo setting. They present a quantization scheme to encode weight updates as a batch of gradients, which can then be processed by leveraging single instruction multiple data (SIMD) methods. Using the Paillier scheme, they demonstrate that their technique improves the training efficiency, with a small drop in accuracy.
Truex et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> use both differential privacy and additive HE to train ML models in the FL setting. However, using the Paillier scheme naively for HE operations (i.e. without any optimizations, such as batching), introduces a large computational overhead.
POSEIDON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> uses FHE in FL for model training. However, they consider a model in which the complete FL process, including the local training done by individual learners, is encrypted; such a formulation adds significant computational overhead. Their work suggests to combine the gradient updates using a tree-like network to reduce the learners’ communication, instead of using a centralized federated learning topology where all learners interact directly with a central controller.
Ma et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> applied the CKKS scheme to FL, but
through a multi-key HE approach, called xMK-CKKS, which employs an aggregated public key with model decryption occurring after clients share information of their individual secret keys.</p>

Additionally, in many instances, a HE scheme can be classified as one of the following: partially-homomorphic (PHE), somewhat-homomorphic (SHE), or fully-homomorphic (FHE). PHE schemes allow for either additive or multiplicative operations over ciphertexts, SHE allow for both but up to a pre-defined limit, and FHE allow for an arbitrary number of additions and multiplications (un-bounded). In our study, we employ a fully-homomorphic encryption scheme due its inherent support for an unbounded number of additive and multiplicative operations, which are essential during the aggregation of encrypted models in federated settings.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we apply the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> fully-homomorphic construction, which is based on the <em id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hardness</em> of the Learning-With-Error (LWE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, or its ring variant (RLWE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) problem. Unlike other FHE schemes, such as the BGV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and BFV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> (integer) constructions, CKKS allows for approximate arithmetic over real and floating point numbers. It is an approximate scheme in the sense that it provides limited (configurable) precision by treating the encryption noise as natural error incurred through approximate computations, and through dropping the least significant bits of computations via the <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rescaling</span> of encrypted data.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Rescaling refers to the underlying process of limiting ciphertext noise, and keeping the scale (controlling the precision) constant throughout a pre-defined number of multiplications allowed in the computation. Due to this, compounded computations (specifically multiplications), scale much more efficiently compared to the integer schemes as they no longer need to be exact. Furthermore, CKKS benefits from <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">packing</span>, the process of slotting multiple data values into one ciphertext, which allows for encrypted computations to be done in a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) fashion. These properties make CKKS useful for our particular use case. We refer the reader to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> for more specific details.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In a centralized federated learning environment, each learner trains on its local dataset for an assigned number of local epochs, and upon completion of its local training task, it sends the local model to the federation controller to compute the new community model. In an encrypted centralized federation environment, the procedure is similar with the addition of three pivotal key steps: <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">encryption</span>, <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">encrypted-aggregation</span>, <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decryption</span>. During the encryption step, every learner encrypts its locally trained model with an HE scheme using the public key, and sends the encrypted model (ciphertext) to the controller. For each learner, its encrypted model is treated as a vector of ciphertext objects, each object corresponding to a model array. With this approach, the encrypted data is represented as a (concatenated) collection of flattened data-vectors, each of them representing the local data for a particular learner. The controller receives all the encrypted local models, and then performs the encrypted weighted-aggregation to compute the new encrypted community model without ever decrypting any of the individual models. Subsequently, the controller sends the new community model to all the learners, and the learners decrypt it using the private key. Once the decryption is complete, the learners train the (new) decrypted model on their local data set and the entire procedure repeats. This pipeline is represented schematically in Fig. <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 5 Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption ‣ Secure Neuroimaging Analysis using Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, and algorithmically in Alg. <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 5 Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption ‣ Secure Neuroimaging Analysis using Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In our setup, the (encrypted) weighted aggregation rule applied by the controller on learners’ local models is based on the local training dataset size of each learner (i.e., FedAvg).</p>

In terms of data distribution, we investigate two distinct cases: <em id="S6.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">IID</em>, where each learner holds training examples that follow the global data distribution, and <em id="S6.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Non-IID</em>, where local distributions may differ substantially from the global.
Specifically, for the BrainAge prediction task, the IID scenario refers to the case where learners hold examples from all possible age ranges, while in Non-IID each learner holds subjects over a subset of ages.
In terms of data amount across learners, we explore two partitioning schemes, with <em id="S6.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Uniform</em> representing the cases where learners hold equal number of examples, and <em id="S6.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Skewed</em>, the case where learners hold different amounts of examples (i.e., the assignment follows a rightly skewed distribution).
For every federated learning environment, the data distribution is provided as an inset inside the federated learning curves of Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Secure Neuroimaging Analysis using Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Secure Neuroimaging Analysis using Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, encryption does not penalize the learning performance of the federated model, and in some learning scenarios (e.g., Skewed &amp; Non-IID) the encrypted model can lead to faster convergence compared to its non-encrypted counterpart. This can be attributed to the stochastic effect that the encryption scheme introduces to the weights of the federated learning model during encoding, decoding and private-aggregation and thereby acting as a regularizer during federated training. Eventually as training progresses, both the encrypted and non-encrypted models reach the same final score.
As the environments become more heterogeneous (from Uniform &amp; IID, to Uniform &amp; Non-IID, to Skewed &amp; Non-IID), they are harder to learn and we observe a small degradation on the final prediction error.</p>
