<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that empowers edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model leveraging local data. Simulating FL on GPU is essential to expedite FL algorithm prototyping and evaluations.
However, current FL frameworks overlook the disparity between algorithm simulation and real-world deployment, which arises from heterogeneous computing capabilities and imbalanced workloads, thus misleading evaluations of new algorithms. Additionally, they lack flexibility and scalability to accommodate resource-constrained clients.
In this paper, we present FedHC, a scalable federated learning framework for heterogeneous and resource-constrained clients.
FedHC realizes system heterogeneity by allocating a dedicated and constrained GPU resource budget to each client, and also simulates workload heterogeneity in terms of framework-provided runtime.
Furthermore, we enhance GPU resource utilization for scalable clients by introducing a dynamic client scheduler, process manager, and resource-sharing mechanism.
Our experiments demonstrate that FedHC has the capability to capture the influence of various factors on client execution time.
Moreover, despite resource constraints for each client, FedHC achieves state-of-the-art efficiency compared to existing frameworks without limits.
When subjecting existing frameworks to the same resource constraints, FedHC achieves a 2.75x speedup.
Code has been released on https://github.com/if-lab-repository/FedHC.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) emerges as a new distributed collaborative learning paradigm, which has drawn much attention from academia and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>; Hard et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Leroy et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Xu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>.
Instead of centralizing data in a single server, federated learning allows data to remain decentralized on individual devices like smartphones. The model training process occurs on edge devices, with the model updates aggregated and sent to a central server for integration.
In order to evaluate the performance of new FL algorithms before real-world deployment, FL simulation frameworks are designed using general CPU/GPUs to host a series of virtual clients, without the need of large-scale real edge devices.
FL simulation frameworks not only provide researchers with algorithm benchmarks but also efficient experimental environment, which helps researchers in FL community get started quickly and develop new FL algorithms.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many existing FL frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caldas et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Ingerman and Ostrowski, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; He et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Beutel et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> focus on providing a platform to simulate different FL algorithms that tackle privacy, security, aggregation, and Non-IID data.
Besides, FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> supports different computing paradigm, including hirarchical FL. Flower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Beutel et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> supports different programming languages and machine learning frameworks. Fedscale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lai et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> supports communication heterogeneity and client availability simulation.
However, current FL frameworks neglect the gap between algorithm simulation and real-world deployment, thus misleading evaluations of new algorithms. Additionally, they lack flexibility and scalability to effectively cater to resource-constrained clients. In the following, we describe the challenges of existing works and our proposed solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the computation time of a client can be affected by many factors in realistic scenarios, such as hardware capability, data volume, model size, input sequence length, and batch size but existing FL frameworks often use oversimplified approach to estimate the client computation time.
Slow clients caused by such factors train fewer local steps, resulting in low training quality. Aggregating models with varied training qualities slows down global model convergence.
Due to the lack of the accurate measurement mechanism for the computation time of the client on existing FL frameworks, when deploying algorithms on real-world edge devices, the heterogeneous computing capabilities and the diverse workloads will cause deviations of the global model convergence from the FL framework and the real world.
Therefore, it is important to reflect the impact of heterogeneous factors on client’s computation time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are three possible ways to represent the computation time of different clients but all of them are limited.
(1) Estimation by modeling the execution latency. This approach combines various factors that affect execution time into a single formula. FedScale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lai et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> roughly estimated the execution time by the system speed and data volume, regardless of other factors such as model size, training configuration, input length, resource contention inside the client. It can not support the evaluation of some straggler acceleration algorithms working on reducing straggler’s workload, such as resource-aware model personalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rapp et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Deng et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Bibikar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Xu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>.
(2) Profiling models on real edge devices. Running the model directly on the real device yields realistic execution time. But this approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive due to variety of models and the need of large-scale edge devices. No FL framework currently uses profiling methods to achieve computational heterogeneity.
(3) Framework-provided runtime. This approach executes models on general CPU/GPUs and uses the wall-clock time on these backends as client’s execution time.
While it effectively handles workload heterogeneity, it lacks support for system heterogeneity within the same backend. For instance, clients sharing the same GPU possess identical computation capabilities, thus losing the ability to simulate diverse computational capacities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fully support the computation heterogeneity caused by system heterogeneity and workload heterogeneity, we propose a new method by assigning specific resource budgets to different clients for heterogeneous computing capabilities. Based on the resource budget, we further use framework-provided runtime to represent execution time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, existing FL frameworks lack the resource management mechanism so that they fail to support scalable clients when considering resource constraints. They assume that clients have sufficient resources and do not impose any resource constraints on them. Based on this,
LEAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caldas et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and TFF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ingerman and Ostrowski, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> run different clients sequentially in single process, which is very time-consuming. Syft <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ryffel et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and FederatedScope <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xie et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> leverage distributed computing but require hardware nodes equal to the number of clients, which is extremely hardware-costly when scaling to massive clients. Flower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Beutel et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and FedScale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lai et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> support multiple clients on each hardware node but lacks resource management according to heterogeneous resource needs.
To build an efficient FL framework featuring resource-constrained system heterogeneity, we face the following challenges:
(1) As a single GPU’s supported parallelism is limited, the prevailing approach for simulating large-scale clients involves launching multiple parallel processes and sequentially running more clients within each process. Nevertheless, the CUDA context correlated with resource budget allocation, created within the process, cannot be altered, conflicting with our techniques for addressing system heterogeneity.
(2) Existing frameworks set fixed number of processes which prevents the client’s parallelism from adjusting based on resource usage.
(3) The total resource budget of parallel clients may not reach 100%, as insufficient remaining resources for the subsequent client result in idleness. Therefore, a reasonable scheduling mechanism is needed to reduce resource waste between clients.
(4) Clients with substantial resource budgets may not maximize resource usage, leaving resources underutilized.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the limitation of heterogeneity and tackle the challenges of efficient framework, we propose <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedHC</span>, a scalable federated learning framework for heterogeneous and resource-constrained clients. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1. INTRODUCTION ‣ FedHC: A Scalable Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous and Resource-Constrained Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our focus lies in enhancing computational flexibility and scalability.
We summarize FedHC’s five unique features as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(i) Supporting system heterogeneity with constrained resource budgets.</span> To simulate the heterogeneous computational capabilities, we design a resource budget manager module that sets a maximum available percentage of GPU resource, representing various resource-constrained clients.
We empower users to effortlessly configure the system heterogeneity by controlling resource partition.
<span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(ii) Enabling workload heterogeneity in real runtime.</span> Besides hardware capability, we recognize that the running time of each client is also influenced by diverse workloads (caused by data volume, model size, input sequence length, and training configuration). As formulating an equation to accurately model or estimate these factors’ impact on execution time proves challenging, we advocate utilizing platform-provided runtime as a representative of execution time. In doing so, diverse workloads are reflected in the runtime.
<span id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(iii) Enhancing scalability via dynamic process management.</span>
In order to solve the conflict between the re-used process and framework-provided system heterogeneity, and the problem of fixed parallelism, we propose dynamic process management.
We terminate the existing process after the client completes training and initiate a new process for allocating a new resource budget. Moreover, we devise a dynamic process management scheme, permitting additional processes during GPU resource idleness and fewer processes when GPU schedules are congested.
<span id="S1.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(iv) Optimizing resource utilization among clients via a scheduler.</span>
To reduce the resource idleness among clients, we develop a client scheduler that orchestrates client execution order and parallelism based on resource budgets, utilizing a double-pointer selection module to identify the next client and a condition check module to determine deployment feasibility.
<span id="S1.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(v) Improving resource utilization within client by resource-sharing parallelism.</span>
To reduce the under-utilization of substantial resource budgets, we propose a resource-sharing method to tackle this problem.
Unlike conventional parallelism, our resource-sharing approach allows the cumulative resource budget of SMs percentage to surpass 100% with clients competing for shared resources without breaching their individual maximum thresholds. This not only improves platform resource efficiency but also preserves system heterogeneity among clients.</p>

From a computational perspective, client execution times result from heterogeneity in numerous aspects, which can be distilled into system and workload heterogeneity.
System heterogeneity involves the different computing speed due to different hardware capabilities.
Heterogeneous workload arises from data volume, model size, training configuration, and intermediate variables.
Diverse training times lead to varying local model qualities, subsequently impacting the global model.
Therefore, simulating workload and system heterogeneity unveils disparities across clients in training times, further influencing aggregation and aiding researchers in developing and evaluating novel algorithms.

Simulating system heterogeneity poses a challenge, as most simulation experiments lack numerous distinct hardware platforms. Running different clients on the same GPU results in homogeneous computation capability. To address this issue, we propose splitting GPU resources and allocating GPU resource shares to various clients. The differences in underlying resources available to each client yield varied computing speed, thus simulating the system heterogeneity.

When a model is deployed to execute on the GPU, it is composed of a series of CUDA kernels. The CUDA kernel is a function that get executed on GPU.
From a software aspect, a kernel is executed as a grid of thread blocks. When mapped to hardware execution, a CUDA block is executed by one streaming multiprocessor (SM) which consists of some CUDA cores. Depending on CUDA blocks’ required resources, one SM can run multiple concurrent CUDA blocks. The CUDA grid comprised of several CUDA blocks is executed on many SMs. The number of SMs occupied depends on the size of the CUDA kernel. When the number of SMs is insufficient, the execution speed of the kernel will slow down. Based on this, our resource partitioning module simulates different computing speeds by limiting the number of SMs available. Instead of arbitrarily using any SMs on a full GPU, we set a <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">resource budget</span> —a subset of SMs, to simulate a resource-constrained client. Different computing capabilites can be obtained by setting different resource budgets. We implement the computing resource partitioning by <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">os.environ[”CUDA_MPS_ACTIVE_THREAD_PERCENTAGE”]</span>. The system heterogeneity we designed is very user-friendly, and only requires users to specify different resource budget parameters.</p>

FedHC supports the simulation and evaluation of various workload heterogeneity. Users can flexibly configure imbalanced data volume or insert data compression method (i.e., data heterogeneity), design heterogeneous models via pruning and additional multi-task model (i.e., model heterogeneity), and customize hyper-parameters such as input sequence length and batch size in training (configuration heterogeneity). As these factors change, the corresponding alterations in training times and impact on global model are reflected. FedHC’s ability to capture these changes stems from the deployments in real runtime. Instead of rough estimation, we record each client’s wall-clock time as their training time. In synchronous aggregation, one global round’s duration is the longest time among all clients’ wall-clock times. In asynchronous aggregation, clients’ participation in the current communication round is determined by their wall-clock times’ order.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, FedHC users only need to set the percentage of computing units and workload-related configuration for each client. FedHC will constrain the resource allocated to the client according to the resource budget. By assigning different resource fractions, variations in running time can be incurred, thus realizing the simulation of system heterogeneity. At the same time, the real runtime of GPU has a natural advantage to reflect workload heterogeneity.</p>

The current approach when running large-scale clients is to launch multiple parallel processes and run the client serially within each process. But it fails down when combined with system heterogeneity and also has the possibility of resource allocation waste or ’explosion’. As mentioned before, we implement the system heterogeneity by assigning a specific resource budget to a specific client at the start of the process. The resource limitation is maintained in the CUDA context. However, CUDA context within the process can only be created at the beginning of the process. Once the process has started, the CUDA context can not be changed, which means the resource budget within the process is constant. So the existing approach – trying to sequentially run clients within each process – can not support our proposed system heterogeneity. Moreover, existing approach can only keep fixed number of parallel processes. When the resource requirements of parallel clients are relatively small, the degree of parallelism should be increased. Conversely, parallelism should be reduced.</p>

To tackle this challenge, we need to launch seperated process for each client for system heterogeneity consideration, and make the number of parallel processes adjustable according to resources needs. We propose a process manager as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1. Dynamic Process Manager ‣ 4.

<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The server is implemented in a long-lasting process, which is alive until the experiment ends. The server can dynamically launch processes for different clients. We use the Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(gRPC, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> to communicate between the server and clients. The communicator transmits the client’s request to the server, and transmits the command signal generated by the server to the client. The status monitor processes the client’s request and generates the next instruction. For example, when the state monitor receives the training completion signal from a client, it may issue an instruction signal for the client to upload its local model according to aggregation strategy. We also open APIs of testing handler, training handler, aggregation strategy for users to customize their settings. The status monitor stores the generated instructions in the record table. The record table has as many rows as the maximum number of parallel processes. Each row of the record table is a First-In-First-Out queue, containing the events to issue to the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The processing switching to achieve scalability contains two aspects: terminating the old process and launching new process for the next client. For the aspect of terminating the old process, once the status monitor of the server receives the signal of client training completion, the process determination module will produce the terminate signal and save the signal in the record table of the corresponding row. It is transmitted to the client then.
The client will jump out of the loop of continuously requesting the server when it receives the terminate signal. The process executing the client will be terminated.
Another aspect of process switching is to launch new processes for subsequent clients. Once the next clients to be executed are determined, the launching module in the server will initiate a new process. The corresponding resource budget for system heterogeneity will be allocated at the beginning of the process, so that the resources available to the process cannot exceed the limit of the resource budget. In this way, we successfully solve the problem that clients running in the same process cannot satisfy system heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The process switching mechanism also breaks through the limitation of fixed parallel quantity, which allows dynamic change of parallel quantity.
Since the existing framework making the same process be reused by different clients, the number of clients running in parallel is always a fixed value. Unlike the fixed number of parallelism, our process switching is flexible to support dynamic number of parallelism. The process launching module can initiate any number of new processes under the premise that no process blockage occurs. The dynamic number of parallelism is determined by the scheduler which will be introduced in the next section. We use the limitation of total resource budget in scheduler and the parameter of maximum parallelism to avoid process blocking. The newly initiated process and the events to be issued for the new process will be recorded in the new queue in the record table.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As described in the previous section, when running large-scale clients, a combination of serial and parallel is required.
Thus a scheduler related to temporal scheduling of client execution order and spatial scheduling of the amount of parallelism is necessary, so as to shorten the execution time of one global round and improve resource utilization.</p>

The current framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lai et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Beutel et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> adopts greedy scheduling. The selected participants in each global round are randomly arranged in the queue and they are scheduled by the order of the queue. The greedy scheduling can cause two problems.
Firstly, the low GPU utilization. When the current remaining GPU resources are less than the resource budget required by the next client, the next client cannot be deployed. As a result, the remaining GPU resources are wasted. So the scheduler should select appropriate parallel clients with the consideration of the resource budget.
Secondly, the long execution time of the global round. If the slow client is executed last and alone, the total execution time of a global round will be longer. Therefore, the slow client should try to have a higher priority when scheduling. However, if all the slow clients are executed at the beginning, the high parallelism may cause process blocking and has the risk of fragmentation problem. Moreover, the gathering of clients with large resource budgets leads to a decrease in parallelism, which cannot make good use of resources. So the scheduler should coordinate the order of clients for temporal consideration.
Overall, the scheduler faces challenges of the spatial optimization to improve the GPU utilization and the temporal optimization to reduce the execution time of the global round.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Method:</span>
To tackle these challenges, we propose a resource-aware scheduler with double pointers. When a client finishes executing, the server will call the scheduler to get the pending list of clients to run. As Algorithm. <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 4.2. Client Scheduler ‣ 4. Resource Optimization Implementation ‣ FedHC: A Scalable Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous and Resource-Constrained Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows, we firstly sort the participants according to their resource budgets, and then cyclically use the left pointer and right pointer to alternately fetch the client until the end condition is met.
We use the left pointer to fetch the client with minimum resource budget, and use the right pointer to fetch the client with maximum resource budget.
Once a client is selected to be executed, the condition checking module checks whether there are enough resources and idle processes to deploy the client. If the current client passes the conditional checks, the client is added to the pending list. On the contrary, when the remaining GPU resources are insufficient to sustain the client pointed by the right pointer, the right pointer will stop. But the left pointer will still continue, because the resource budget of the client on the left is less than that on the right, which can fill the remaining GPU resources. Until the client pointed by the left pointer cannot meet the condition checking, the algorithm will end and the pending list will be output. The pending list of clients with its resource budget and corresponding process will be used by the process launching module in the dynamic process manger as mentioned before.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this way, clients with large and small resource budgets execute in parallel at the beginning, and clients with moderate resource budgets execute in parallel later. This prevents clients with small resource budget from slowing down the execution time of the global round, and also improves resource utilization.</p>

Under the hard margin strategy, all clients execute within their own resource budget and do not affect each other. The soft margin strategy allows partial resource sharing.

When executing these two clients on single GPU, we assign 60% and 30% resource budget separately for each client so as to implement the hardware heterogeneity.

The resources occupied by the two clients are independent and will not affect each other. Different operators have different requirements for computing resources. Compute-intensive operators like convolution need more computing resource, otherwise it takes more time. When executing operators that don’t require too many resources, there will be many idle resources in the large resource budget. These idle resources cause low GPU utilization.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve this problem, we propose soft margin resource partition strategy. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3. Resource-sharing Parallelism ‣ 4. Resource Optimization Implementation ‣ FedHC: A Scalable Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous and Resource-Constrained Clients" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(c), we allow 15% computing resource sharing. For resource sharing area, two situation exist: Resource contention occurs when two big operators meet; If there are idle resources on one client, another client will fill the resource idle under the premise of not exceeding resource budget constraints.
Compared with hard margin resource partition strategy, the soft margin strategy has two advantages.
Firstly, the resource idle is reduced thanks to resource sharing, thus improving the GPU utilization.
Secondly, because of the resource overlap, the total resource budget is reduced from 90% to 75%, which leaves more resource space to increase the number of parallel clients.</p>

FedHC provides the parameter to set the up-bounded resource constraint of all clients. Users only need to set the parameter at the beginning of the experiment. Hard margin resource partition strategy requires the parameter no more than 100%. Otherwise, if the up-bounded resource constraint is set higher than 100% (soft margin resource partition strategy), FedHC will automatically use the excess as a shared resource.</p>

To show that FedHC can reflect the impact of different factors that could change the client training time, we change the value of resource budget, input sequence length, model layers, and batch size and record the client training time.
We experiment with the task of sentiment classification on the dataset SST-2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Socher et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, the movie reviews with binary classes. We partition the data into Non-IID distribution. The base model we use is multi-layer LSTM.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also progressively adjust these factors on FedScale (the state-of-art FL framework) and FedHC to compare the heterogeneity support of different frameworks.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, we design experiments to show the impact of the hardware heterogeneity and workload heterogeneity on the global convergence.
To show the effect of workload heterogeneity on the global convergence, we add an extra local model to increase the workload. Some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> are proposed to train a local model to perform client personalization, which increased workload for client.
We train an image classification FL task on the Cifar10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Krizhevsky et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> dataset. 20 clients are generated in an Non-IID setting and 80% clients are used to participate in local training in each global round.
The accuracy of the global model over time is recorded separately with and without extra local model.
To show the effect of hardware heterogeneity on the global convergence, we conduct experiments with/without hardware heterogeneity setting on FEMNIST dataset. In the setting without hardware heterogeneity, all clients are executed on the whole GPU. In the hardware heterogeneity setting, each client is assigned a specific resource budget to constrain the computing capabilities.

As FedHC assigns resource budgets to clients for the consideration of hardware heterogeneity. We transfer the computing speed dataset released in FedScale to the resource budget. We generate varying resource budgets for 2800 clients and illustrate the distribution in Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6.1. Support for Heterogeneous FL ‣ 6.

The y-axis represents the number of clients with a specific resource budget, while the x-axis indicates the percentage of computing units on the GPU (SMs).
For framework comparison, we choose several advanced FL frameworks, FedML, Flower, and FedScale.
We use the FeMNIST dataset with a Non-IID partition and apply the same data to all frameworks for fair comparison.
We train the model ResNet18 with local data and aggregate models using FedAvg.
We set the same hyper parameters on all frameworks to keep the same workload. 10 clients are selected in one global round. For each client, we train on 500 batches of data, and the batch size is 64.
We record the duration including training, testing and so on for each round to compare the framework efficiency.
We firstly use the original setting for each framework.
Next, we compare the framework efficiency in a more practical scenario where clients have limited resource in the context of FedScale, using the same setting as FedHC. We scale the number of participants in each round from 100 to 2000.
Finally, we evaluate the model convergence across different numbers of participants on FedHC framework.</p>

Our approach enhances resource utilization and parallelism by coordinating the execution order of clients, effectively balancing resource-intensive and resource-light clients.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enable simulation of large-scale heterogeneous devices in real FL, we introduce FedHC, a scalable federated learning framework for heterogeneous and resource-constrained clients. Existing FL research platforms do not support scalable FL clients especially when considering hardware heterogeneity and diverse workloads. Unlike rough estimation methods, we assign a resource budget to each client, resulting in varying runtimes due to heterogeneous resource constraints, and any workload heterogeneity can also be reflected within the runtime. Furthermore, we enhance resource utilization of GPU for scalable clients through a dynamic process manager to control parallelism, a client scheduler for temporal and spatial coordination, and a resource-sharing method to reduce idling. Experiments show FedHC can perform large scale FL experiments with heterogeneous FL scenarios, enabling researchers to explore more FL design opportunities.</p>
