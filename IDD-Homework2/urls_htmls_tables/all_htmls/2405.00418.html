<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Computing is still under a significant threat from ransomware, which necessitates prompt action to prevent it. Ransomware attacks can have a negative impact on how smart grids, particularly digital substations. In addition to examining a ransomware detection method using artificial intelligence (AI), this paper offers a ransomware attack modeling technique that targets the disrupted operation of a digital substation. The first, binary data is transformed into image data and fed into the convolution neural network model using federated learning. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested technique detects ransomware with a high accuracy rate.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, cyber threats are one of the costliest losses an institution can encounter. Ransomware is malware that threatens to publish the victim’s data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid. It became popular in the early 2010s, and its use has been overgrown. Ransomware attacks have been increasing in number and sophistication in recent years. WannaCry, for example, was a ransomware worm that spread rapidly across the world in May 2017, affecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of federated learning techniques, it becomes possible to train machine learning models on data that is distributed across different devices or organizations. The federated learning approach has the potential to be used in training models for detecting ransomware. The reason is that, in a federated learning setting, each data owner keeps its data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. Therefore, the data never leaves the owner’s premises, which alleviates privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning neural network that is generally used for image classification and recognition. It has been shown to be effective in various types of image classification tasks. An idea comes to using the CNN model to classify ransomware attacks. The advantages of using the CNN model are that it can automatically learn features from data and that it is robust to data variability. In addition, it also allows the representation of the data in a more compact and efficient way.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The paper first preprocesses the data into images and then uses the CNN model to learn and classify the data. The proposed method has the advantage of being privacy-preserving because the data never leaves the data owner’s premises. By experimenting, we found that our proposed model is more accurate than several traditional methods in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are several methods proposed in the literature for detecting ransomware. Takeuchi et al. proposed a detection method using support vector machines (SVMs). The key idea is to trace the API call when the ransomware is executing. With this approach, the authors can detect unseen ransomware by the similarity of API calls between samples. Another approach proposed by Arabo et al. is to monitor the behavior of the ransomware process. The key idea is to monitor the process behavior to detect ransomware. In this approach, the authors look into the key process usages to detect ransomware. They also include the analysis of DLLs and system calls.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, the ransomware detection methods proposed in the literature have several limitations. First, many of them require the use of static features, which may be hard to collect, especially on obfuscated and metamorphic binaries. Second, many of them require the use of dynamic features, which means that they require the execution of the ransomware for analysis. As a result, we may want some approximate static features that can be used to detect ransomware.</p>

Supervised learning is a staple of many machine learning problems. It involves learning any input for which we already know the target or labels. The applications of near-complete deep learning are usually aimed at: object recognition, voice recognition, image classification, and supervised machine learning. Most of these include two problems, namely classification and regression problems. It can also be extended to several issues such as sequence generation, syntax tree prediction, object detection, and image segmentation. Some famous criteria of supervised learning are face recognition and spam detection</p>

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning technique that involves training using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. When unlabeled data is combined with a modest bit of labeled data, learning accuracy can be significantly improved.

It was long overlooked, but this branch of learning was recently noticed when Google DeepMind successfully applied it to learning to play the game of Go. In reinforcement learning, an actor receives information about its environment and chooses actions that maximize the reward. For example, a neural network idles into an electromagnetic game screen and outputs in-game actions to maximize its score which can be trained through reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a relatively new field of research and has not had significant practical success outside of games. However, we expect reinforcement learning to be widely applied in many fields. such as self-driving cars, robotics, resource management, and education.</p>

The objective of federated learning is to enable the use of collective intelligence to enable all devices to learn a shared model directly from user data and improve the accuracy of individual devices. Federated learning is a type of conventional machine learning that is distributed and decentralized, so it can be used when users do not have to share their data with a central server due to privacy and security concerns.</p>

Deep learning can be used to process data in many ways. For example, deep learning can be used to process unordered text data, images, time-series data, and structured data such as relational databases. Deep learning can be used to extract high-level feature representations from data automatically. Deep learning can also be used to learn complex functions from data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A Convolutional Neural Network Model is developed to classify the two classes. The CNN has a total of 3 hidden layers with 1 convolution layers, 1 Dropt Out layer and two fully connected layers. The final output layer is two classes, a classification layer with Sigmoid activation. The structure of CNN is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Detection of ransomware attacks using federated learning based on the CNN model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, which contains a combination of convolutional layers, Dropout layer to prevent overfitting, rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation layers, Fully connected layers and an output layer.

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of federated learning is not to increase accuracy but to increase data privacy and solve the problem of data decentralization, so in this experiment, we simulate training data on different servers. Considering a real-world scenario where the training data for ransomware attacks is on three different servers, this data is the combination of user behavior data and the data generated by the malware itself. To train a model that is more robust to ransomware detection, data from all three servers have to be used to train the model. However, data from each server is sensitive and should not be shared with other servers. So the federated learning concept can be used to train a model that is more robust to ransomware detection. In federated learning, the model is trained on each server with its own data and then the weights of the model are shared with the other servers. In this way, the data remains private.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the experimental results show some positive results, there are some limitations to our experimental setup. First, the size of our dataset is relatively small. This limitation may lead to overemphasizing the robustness of our federated learning algorithm. Future work will consider a larger dataset. Second, our dataset is mostly equally distributed among clients. However, the data is distributed unequally among clients in the real world. We will consider this case in future work. Third, our experiment can easily split the data into two separate labels, normal and abnormal. However, real-world data may be far more complex and have more classes. We will also consider this case in future work.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Also, there is a high risk to learn two important bias. Ransomware binaries are often quite small and zipped by UPX to escape signature based detection. That’s why we have to be particularly careful when creating the learning dataset.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Proposed system can classify normal and ransomware attacks with high efficiency. The Proposed CNN Model has been tested with a variety of federated learning techniques and the attention of the CNN has been visualized for a better understanding of the classification decisions made by the model to differentiate. Moreover, there has been a detailed analysis done for different Fedarate learning training techniques for the model and further, the model layers and training parameters can be tweaked to improve and make it more robust.</p>
