<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector extensively uses documents supporting product and process development. As part of this, organisations should handle big data of hundreds, or even thousands, of technical documents strongly linked together, including CAD design of industrial plants, equipment purchase orders, quality certificates, and part material analysis. However, analysing such records is daunting for users because it gets complicated to sift through hundreds of documents to establish valuable relationships. This paper addresses how knowledge extracted from linked engineering documents contributes to industrial digitalisation under IT/OT convergence. The proposed GraphLED is a system tasked with data processing, graph-based modelling, and colourful visualisation of related documents. The graph-based approach ensures an improved understanding of linked information because the graph structure offers a promising tool to model the underlying data properties of engineering documents. Preliminary system validation indicates quality improvements are possible in the OCR-based data (85.9% of ambiguous text data removed). This work has the potential to benefit the industry by improving the reliability and resilience of industrial production systems through automated summaries of large quantities of documents and their linkage.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Ubiquitous data creation has grown at a rapid pace, with big data collection providing tangible digital transformation benefits in several industries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, data remains document-centric in mixed analogue, and digital formats in more traditional sectors, including architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Organisations often deal with hundreds, or even thousands, of technical documents such as CAD design of industrial factory plants, fleet design, equipment purchase orders, quality certificates, and material analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The management of technical documents with efficient tools leads to efficient coordination of critical day-to-day activities throughout AEC process lifetime <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.To this end, continuous data processing and visualisation bring considerable benefits to the AEC end-users: (i) support timely inspection of engineering projects, (ii) develop automated document compliance models with existing standards and societies’ guidelines and (iii) promote information exchange among key stakeholders (suppliers, clients, standards societies). However, AEC documents are inherently complex because diverse unstructured topics usually link many documents to convey the information. Conventional state-of-the-art approaches that handle structured data (e.g. search by keywords in relational databases) are not feasible in this case <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The relationship between the tables is defined in advance, so users can only obtain limited relevant knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Paper-based documents further complicate the matter where scanned handwritten reports, technical specifications, engineering drawings, schematics, stamps, signatures and so on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> make it challenging to retrieve information efficiently, even in its simplest form. For instance, a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">databook</span> –a collection of engineering documents that specify project events – comprises many pieces of data (i.e. topics) that coherently link with data present in other databooks. This interconnection creates a complex yet powerful <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">network</span> of related engineering documents that offer several features. For instance, the end-users can visually inspect the material traceability of equipment parts and their compliance with current technical specifications (e.g. ASTM - American Society for Testing and Materials). Today the visualisation and inspection of a large dataset of documents become challenging and error-prone if the user is not assisted by big data tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A key high-level question in this context is: <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how could knowledge, namely engineering document summaries and their relationships, extracted from noisy OCR processed engineering documents contribute to industrial digitalisation and resilience of production systems?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The knowledge extraction is expected to be carried out efficiently and close to real-time. Equally important in this process is the exploitation of the cross-reference data between documents to obtain new information, a task that is inherently difficult for humans because of the document network depth and broadness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper sheds some light to answer the question above. The proposed approach considers a simple yet promising mechanism to extract and structure the data for processing, knowledge extraction, and visualisation from diverse engineering databooks. The GraphLED is a system tasked with data processing, graph-based modelling, and visualisation of related documents. The graph-based approach ensures an improved understanding of linked information because the graph structure offers a first-hand tool to represent and model the underlying data properties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The system assumes a moderate level of correctness in the close-to-real-time knowledge extraction from scanned documents, particularly cross-reference data. For instance, ambiguous data from OCR processing introduces errors that should be handled accordingly.</p>

The system architecture is discussed in Section 4. Finally, sections 5 and 6 present the validation results and draw the paper’s conclusions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Engineering databooks are complex documents. The user’s acceptable level of data correctness associated with the knowledge extraction remains an open challenge, particularly considering the output quality obtained from the available OCR tools (e.g. Tesseract, Google OCR). The issue is beyond the OCR tools, where low-quality scanning of documents remains the norm in the industry. Conventional approaches that handle structured data are not very robust in this case, as noisy data in document table cells lead to limited relevant
knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several applications use graph-based analysis to extract knowledge and visualise the results. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> seeks to create public awareness of UN members voting patterns. The approach uses social knowledge graphs and similarity measures to analyse the publicly available information on the member votes. Because graphs lend themselves to intuitive visualisation, this work explored visual aids from the data. However, such an approach is less robust to data noise since stages of acquisition, treatment, and handling of the data require a prior pre-processed and ready-for-use dataset. Linked engineering AEC documents establish connections (e.g. purchase order number, quality certificate ID) that can be followed and analysed through automated software tools <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The graph-based analysis explores algorithms on graph data structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. For instance, the graph-based document representation system (CGDR) provides classification reports intended for document forensic analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A total of 1500 files were used in the study to classify 16 types of reports. The method structures the information as graph nodes and uses hierarchical text classification to set the reading order. However, the proposed model is not the ideal solution as it still depends on human experts to identify the useful features for each type of report.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A more automated and adaptive approach could benefit the application in many ways. Also, the data should be inputted in an advanced processing stage (e.g. augmented, cleaned) for the system to work. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes a graph-based method for inductive text classification in documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The system builds individual graphs for each document fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that learns fine-grained word representations based on their local structures. The proposed approach can effectively produce embeddings for unseen words in new documents. However, the noisy data limit the robustness of the proposed work. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduces knowledge graphs and ontologies to cope with the complex network of decisions in construction documents. Other related work explores methods and algorithms in automated analysis of engineering drawings, commonly used in the oil and gas engineering industry.</p>

<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> acknowledge the document quality as being the backbone of the problem, given that a poor-quality drawing (e.g. a paper that has been scanned numerous times) is virtually impossible to digitise unless a robust set of pre-processing methods are used.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed work addressed the problem using a deep neural network with satisfactory improvements. However, the approach remains model-centric (i.e. model hyperparameter tuning) with little effort in improving the raw data quality through pre-processing, cleaning, augmentation or re-shaping. Existing work explores to a great extent digitalisation of documents through OCR (Optical character recognition) based techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The benefits of the links between documents to unveil very relevant patterns in knowledge extraction are not sufficiently explored in the previous work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The prior art acknowledges the challenge of achieving a satisfactory level of data correctness regarding close-to-real-time knowledge extraction from scanned documents, particularly cross-reference data. Data noise propagates throughout the knowledge extraction processing pipeline to visualisation and user engagement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p9" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The previous work primarily addresses the correctness problem using human-intensive correction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or, more recently, using model-centric deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where the job is to fine-tune model hyperparameters as opposed to improve input data quality.

Some examples of variations include the terms: "supplier-A": "A-supplier", "supplier-A.inc", "group-A-supplier". The key idea for dealing with this issue is to identify variations of the same entity (a supplier) in the dataset and standardize them in a single form of writing. The ambiguity removal algorithm was developed to accomplish this task. The algorithm produced a list of 18 distinct suppliers, just one supplier off the specialist’s list, as is summarised in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.1 Data Quality ‣ 5 System Validation Results ‣ GraphLED: A graph-based approach to process and visualise linked engineering documents" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. As a result, the algorithm removed 110 ambiguous nodes in the graph - total removal of 99.09% of ambiguous nodes and an 85.93% reduction in the number of nodes from 128 to 18 suppliers.</p>
