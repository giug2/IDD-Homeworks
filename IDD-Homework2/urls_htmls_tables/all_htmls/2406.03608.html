<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a decentralized framework that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model under the orchestration of a central server without sharing their local data. The centrality of this framework represents a point of failure which is addressed in literature by blockchain-based federated learning approaches. While ensuring a fully-decentralized solution with traceability, such approaches still face several challenges about integrity, confidentiality and scalability to be practically deployed. In this paper, we propose Fantastyc, a solution designed to address these challenges that have been never met together in the state of the art.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an important paradigm in modern large-scale machine learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Unlike in traditional centralized learning where models are trained using large datasets stored in a central server, in federated setting, the training data remains distributed over a large number of clients, which may be phones, network sensors, hospitals or companies. A federated model is then trained under the supervision of a central server by aggregating only ephemeral locally-computed updates, thereby ensuring a basic level of privacy by design. However, FL still faces key challenges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to be fully accepted in both institutional and industrial sectors. First, the training process should provide guarantees to ensure its robustness to malicious actors who try to degrade the accuracy of the model (integrity) or retrieve sensitive information about isolated training data (privacy). Second, the federated process should not collapse even if there is a large number of participants to the training step (scalability). Third, the server which orchestrates the federated process is a central player which potentially represents a single point of failure. While large companies or organizations can play this role in some application scenarios, a reliable and powerful central server may not always be available or desirable in more collaborative learning scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, a growing research effort is dedicated to propose fully decentralized learning through blockchain-based Federated Learning (BC-based FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Blockchains offer a secure, shared ledger among users, where information is stored and verified by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. The peer-to-peer network adds new information to the ledger thanks to a consensus mechanism tolerant to malicious participants.
As a result, blockchains provide a means to eliminate the need for trust in a central server. Indeed, the blockchain could be used to validate and store updates and models to secure the FL process. Additionally, blockchains incorporate native incentive mechanisms. These mechanisms encourage users to participate honestly in the system, leveraging the audit trail of users participation registered in the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, however, current BC-based FL solutions do not address all the challenges as a whole, which makes them not fully secure or practical. A fundamental issue lies in the scalability of blockchains, particularly concerning the latency required to register transactions, a factor influenced by the size of the registered data and the number of clients. In this paper, our objective is to develop a BC-based FL system that ensures both model integrity with proven guarantees, addresses privacy concerns, and maintains practicality even with a large number of clients. Our goal is to implement realistic model training scenarios, akin to those used in classical benchmarking for FL image classification tasks (such as Federated Extended MNIST), involving thousands of clients and models of several megabytes in size.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose Fantastyc. In our design, we leverage blockchain technology with a specific emphasis on reducing interactions with it, all the while capitalizing on its inherent advantages. To enhance efficiency, especially given the resource-intensive nature of validating updates and models, we offload the validation process – meant to be handled by the blockchain – to a dedicated set of servers. These servers handle aggregation and generate validity proofs, ensuring the integrity of the FL process. Clients can efficiently verify model integrity by examining these validity proofs. Moreover, we tackle the challenge of managing large-sized data that cannot be directly stored on-chain. Our solution involves employing a fault-tolerant key-value store for registering client updates and models as follows. In each round of the FL process, clients updates are gathered by servers, stored in the storage and cryptographically anchored in the blockchain alongside validity proofs, to record client participation. By reading the updates anchored in the blockchain, each server retrieves an identical set of client updates before aggregating them and produce the next model. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates these ideas, highlighting the additional components we use in our architecture with respect to a centralized, non-Byzantine tolerant solution. The figure focuses on the exchange of data in a single FL iteration. In the centralized version, the clients performing the local training send their updates (the gradients) to the server for that iteration. The server performs aggregation and sends back the aggregated model to clients. In our solution, all participants register in the system via the blockchain before engaging in the learning process. The aggregation is then handled by a set of participants who register to play the role of servers (where a minority can be Byzantine). Servers perform robust aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to filter out Byzantine client contributions while engaging in a protocol to certify the validity of the obtained aggregated model to send back to clients. At the conclusion of this protocol, a validity proof is generated. Both clients’ updates and aggregated models are stored in a replicated storage, while their anchors (i.e., cryptographic hashes) are stored in the blockchain, along with the proofs. Interestingly, servers also write via the proof the contributions from the clients they retained for the aggregation, establishing a trail of client contributions to be exploited for rewarding.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain is a decentralized immutable ledger, which consists of a sequence of linked blocks, each containing a set of transactions. Transactions allow blockchain users to immutably record information, which constitutes a common knowledge shared among blockchain users. In particular, this information is transparent, tamper-resistant, and totally ordered. At the core of each blockchain, the consensus mechanism plays a pivotal role in appending new blocks without breaking the chain structure. In our context, we focus on blockchains based on BFT-Consensus, such as Cosmos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and Tezos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which provide immediate finality, ensuring that once a block is added, it cannot be revoked.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most blockchains, like Tezos and Ethereum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, feature smart contracts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> for programmability. Smart contracts are self-executing scripts tied to specific blockchains, deployed and executed through transactions, placing both the generic applications and the blockchain logic on the same layer. In contrast, Cosmos introduces the ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface), separating the blockchain from application logic. With Cosmos ABCI, the blockchain only records transactions, while applications independently process and update their state, enhancing modularity and deployment flexibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While blockchain offers security and decentralization, it also faces scalability limitations, particularly in transactions per second and communication latency. For instance, in Tendermint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> (now CometBFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>), the underlying consensus mechanism for Cosmos, the average throughput is approximately 430 transactions per second with a latency of 3.45 seconds in the presence of 128 correct nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
These constraints stem from the consensus mechanism and the distributed nature of blockchain, resulting in substantial memory costs as each node maintains an updated replica.
Therefore, blockchain usage must be approached with frugality, emphasizing the efficient and careful use of resources to ensure sustainability and optimize performance.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">BlockFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is a pioneering work that introduces a conceptual architecture where clients record their local updates in a public (proof-of-work) blockchain and perform local aggregation as soon as a sufficient number of local updates are written on the blockchain.
This approach might be suited for small-sized models that can fit within blocks, even if the paper does not present a concrete solution and evaluation. Furthermore, the architecture relies on each client being associated with a single miner for sending and downloading blocks. However, a malicious miner could potentially pose a threat by refusing to include a client’s local update in the blockchain or by remaining silent, causing availability issues. Finally, in the proposed architecture, miners are expected to validate the correctness of client updates by confirming that each update has been executed across the entire client dataset, because a client might send fake updates without incurring the cost of training. This verification relies on both miners having knowledge of each client’s data size and the presence of a trusted execution environment at each client, ensuring the integrity of the clients’ contributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FLChain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> shares similarities with BlockFL in its use of blockchains to record local updates. However, it diverges from BlockFL by introducing an additional cryptographic layer to encrypt the local updates stored in the blockchain. Aggregation is then executed by (a subset of) blockchain nodes on these encrypted updates, and the resulting aggregated model is stored in the blockchain. Subsequently, aggregated models are collectively decrypted by clients, with each client holding the ability to decrypt only a share of each aggregated model. The approach also includes incentive mechanisms designed to motivate participants to provide uncorrupted shares. Much like BlockFL, this approach does not explicitly address concerns related to Byzantine clients conducting poisoning attacks. Also, due to the substantial utilization of the blockchain and the collaborative decrypting algorithm, it is better suited for smaller-sized models and a few number of clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">VFChain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> shares architectural concepts similar to FLChain and BlockFL. However, it distinguishes itself by providing finely-tuned mechanisms for the dynamic election of an aggregation committee. Nonetheless, the storage of aggregated models in the blockchain is maintained, and experimental evaluations have been conducted with a participant count not exceeding 10. It is important to note that in this system, clients are regarded as honest but curious, while Byzantine behavior is attributed solely to aggregators, with a tolerance for up to one-third of them. In BFLC<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a similar architecture with a committee is used for efficiency, whereas a robust aggregation function is implemented by committee members to defend the system from Byzantine clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">BFEL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, in comparison to the aforementioned approaches, introduces a more sophisticated architectural design. It combines a public blockchain with private blockchains, with each private blockchain dedicated to a specific FL task. This approach optimizes storage efficiency in multi-task scenarios and enhances privacy. Additionally, to alleviate communication overhead resulting from the exchange of large models, BFEL applies a gradient compression method. In this system, a committee of verifiers plays a crucial role in filtering out potentially poisoned models submitted by clients. However, it is worth noting that the verification method relies on each verifier using a testing dataset to evaluate the updates, instead of employing more robust aggregation techniques that might offer greater reliability. Experimental evaluations have been conducted with two parallel images classification tasks, in a local machine, without exceeding 22 clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">BlockFLA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> also introduces a hybrid architecture, where a private blockchain is integrated with a public blockchain. In this setup, model updates are entirely stored within the private blockchain and are subsequently linked to the public blockchain for accountability via a smart contract. While the paper mentions the existence of a verification function within the smart contract, it does not provide specific details regarding its functioning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, Biscotti <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> refines and elaborates on principles stipulated by FLChain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> by introducing a three-role structure: noisers create unbiased noise for clients to mask local updates, verifiers endorse masked updates through robust filtering, and aggregators confidentially aggregate the endorsed updates. Aggregators work with encrypted data to ensure privacy. The encrypted aggregated model is stored on the blockchain within commitments to endorsed updates. Unlike our approach, Biscotti, by storing the model on the blockchain, can only handle small models (models with thousands of parameters as opposed to millions in our approach). Additionally, there’s uncertainty about the purpose of the noise particularly considering the authors’ statement that they do not utilize it at the end due to significant utility loss. Without noise, verifiers access unmasked client updates, posing a privacy risk if even a single verifier is compromised. Therefore, finding the right trade-offs between noise and utility is essential to ensure privacy while using this architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">It is also worth to mention some other research efforts, such as those in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, that have delved into solutions within the Ethereum blockchain framework to replace the model-aggregating server with smart contracts. However, deploying these smart contracts on public blockchain systems can incur significant costs, mainly due to miner fees. These costs are associated with the computational workload and the substantial storage requirements resulting from full replication on every blockchain node. As a result, these approaches are typically more suitable for handling simpler models and tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our solution distinguishes itself from existing state-of-the-art solutions by minimizing blockchain utilization through a novel off-chain Byzantine-tolerant protocol leveraging distributed storage servers, ensuring the integrity and availability of off-chain data and computations without depleting system resources. Moreover,
our construction seamlessly adapts its protocol to limit the risk of information leakage without introducing any additional overhead while integrating secure guarantees to remain robust in the presence of both Byzantine clients and servers. Notably, it offers an enhanced level of Byzantine tolerance compared to existing solutions, requiring a majority of honest servers rather than the conventional two-thirds, making it a more secure option.
Interesting, because of its modular architecture, our solution offers as well the flexibility to be deployed as a private, public, or hybrid blockchain while allowing users to initialize learning tasks with any type of aggregation, selection, and rewarding function. </p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of ensuring robustness against Byzantine attacks, a critical challenge lies in guaranteeing that clients do not retrieve poisoned models from potentially malicious servers. This challenge can be faced harnessing the power of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of the models collected by clients.
To illustrate this approach, let us envision the blockchain as a ledger – an immutable, ordered list of records accessible for both clients and servers to write and read. We present two distinct strategies:</p>

This ensures that any set recorded in the blockchain, if valid, contains updates available in the storage and produced by selected clients. This mechanism provides certainty to a server; if they miss some updates necessary to aggregate the next model, they are assured they can retrieve them in the storage. A similar approach applies when servers interact with clients. Indeed, once servers compute the next aggregated model, they store it in the distributed storage, and create a proof before sending it directly to clients. This approach provides clients with verifiable evidence of integrity and availability, mitigating concerns related to computational manipulation.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">By design, FL intrinsically protects the data stored on each device by sharing model updates (<span id="S4.SS3.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> gradients) instead of the original data. While sharing gradients was thought to leak significantly less information about the clients compared to the raw data, recent papers developed a “gradient inversion attack” by which honest-but-curious servers are able to reconstruct parts of the client’s private data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Homomorphic encryption is the gold standard for a privacy-preserving solution but its large computational demand still makes it not compatible with scalability despite recent improvements<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Based on literature, we propose countermeasures to limit the risks of information leakage. We advise clients who want to participate in the training process to apply InstaHide<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> data augmentation to their dataset.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.7" class="ltx_p">As this step permits to train a neural network on linear combinations of examples instead of raw data, an attacker could only retrieve the virtual examples. The capacity of inferring the raw data from the virtual ones requires the knowledge of the mixing coefficients but this information seems hard to obtain in a realistic scenario.
However, InstaHide adds an another layer of security that consists in picking a random sign-flipping pattern <math id="S4.SS3.p1.5.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma\in\{-1,1\}^{d}"

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">This section evaluates the practicality of our solution in a realistic federated learning scenario. Initially, we characterize the required number of clients to be selected in each round of the FL process to achieve good accuracy (Section <a href="#S6.SS2" title="VI-B Experimental setup - model and dataset ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-B</span></span></a>). Subsequently, we assess the accuracy loss when implementing confidentiality and robust aggregation methods (Section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="VI-C Privacy and robustness trade-offs evaluation ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span></span></a>).

For the experiments, we evaluate a deployment where within each node we collocate a server, a blockchain validator, and a storage replica (a peer, in Zenoh’s parlance). We consider several configurations where the nodes and the clients are spread in up to four different regions (EU, US-west, US-east, Asia). At each region we collocate one or more instances (dedicated Linode machines with 32GB of memory) which host the nodes. For the FL clients, we let each Tendermint client (called a proxy client) to generate the workload of a set of realistic participants (recall a participant is an FL client that takes part in the training). At each round, each proxy client sends the payloads from the set of participants it contains in sequential fashion. We deploy up to two instances per region, each of them with a number of nodes that varies between one and 16. We evenly distribute the clients among instances deployed in all regions, where each instance may contain up to 8 proxy clients. Each proxy client is capable of generating the workload for between 2 to 5 participants. Typically, we ensure a balanced distribution by limiting the number of instances to a maximum of four and adjusting the number of participants per proxy client to fall within the range of 10, 50, or 100 participants in total. The communication bandwidth between the regions is in the range of 3Mbps–10Mbps.</p>

Preliminary experiments yield a practical limit of 16 nodes, above of said limit the latency degrades very quickly due to depletion of resources at the Linode instances. The top two curves correspond to round latency with payload 12MB, with either four regions and one instance per region (blue) or two regions and two instances per region (orange). The best round latency with 16 nodes is 96s with two regions. The next two curves show the round time respectively with a mocked model of size 6KB. The best latency with 16 nodes is 20s with four regions. Finally, the base line plots the block times associated to the configurations of the four curves above (green and red for 12MB payload and four or two regions respectively, purple and brown for 6KB payload and four or two regions respectively).
These experiments confirm that the block time is independent of the payload size, which is to be expected given Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Efficient Resource Use by Proof of Availability &amp; Integrity and Optimally Replicated Fault-tolerant Key-value Store ‣ IV Design Choices and Key Ideas ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a> and smoothly increases with the number of nodes in nominal network conditions.</p>

From the results it can be noted than on average for the smaller model the overhead increases linearly with the number of nodes. On the other hand, for the large model, the overhead increases sub-linearly with the number of nodes. In general, our approach is able to optimise the case of the larger models. As observed in the latency breakdown (Fig.<a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-E Scalability evaluation ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), this is due to the

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.2" class="ltx_p">This paper introduced Fantastyc, a blockchain-based federated learning system that is provably secure, improves Byzantine tolerance, limits the risks of sensitive information leakage and showcases practical applicability by amortizing the cost of growing workloads with the number of server replicas in nominal network conditions. Future work will primarily concentrate on two concurrent axes: the first involves further improving the underlying communication overhead by implementing gradient compression techniques, studying privacy/utility trade-offs. The second axis revolves around incentive mechanisms that can leverage the participation count of FL contributors in each round to address the issue of free-riding<span id="footnote15" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">15</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">15</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">15</span>Free-riding in this context is related to the problem of an agent that will prefer not endeavoring the cost of learning while presenting fake gradients.</span></span></span>. Indeed, even if completely eliminating free-riding without access to each client’s specific dataset remains an unsolved challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, robust incentive mechanisms encouraging agents to exhibit honest behavior can be designed, assuming the presence of an auditor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Blockchain-based auditor mechanisms are then a promising avenue of research. As part of our future work, we also explore a mechanism for dynamically adjusting <math id="S7.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>.
That would allow to lift Assumption <a href="#Thmassumption1" title="Assumption 1 ‣ V-A2 Floating points and non-determinism handling ‣ V-A Solution workflow and algorithms ‣ V System Detailed Design ‣ Fantastyc: Blockchain-based Federated Learning Made Secure and Practical" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, enabling to start the FL process with a small <math id="S7.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>, without risking a deadlock.
Finally, we could also make our solution robust to backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. As our architecture is modular, it seems straightforward to integrate a post-training defense such as the one presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>
