<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Basic chemical principles and process calculations, including material and energy balances, heat transfer, phase equilibrium, and reaction kinetics, underpins modeling and optimization in the chemical process industries. These principles are crucial for control and optimization. Process dynamics predict plant behavior and stability, while control ensures desired conditions, quality, and safety. Optimization maximizes profitability, productivity, and efficiency within constraints, contributing to operational excellence. Advances in generative AI, particularly general-purpose large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> and Google’s Gemini <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>, have shown remarkable proficiency in mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills due to extensive pretraining, revolutionizing various fields. These LLMs can assist engineers in making informed decisions and innovating in the chemical and process industries as decision support tools. Despite these advancements, their ability to solve complex chemical and process calculations remains understudied. Additionally, there is currently no specialized foundational model built for tackling complex chemical and process calculations. There is a need to fine-tune existing pre-trained LLMs on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to develop a new core foundational AI model for solving complex chemical and process calculations. The size and complexity of closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 make it difficult to customize them for specialized tasks and edit knowledge, particularly on consumer hardware with limited computational budgets. In contrast, open small language models (SLMs) like Google Gemma<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite> and Meta Llama<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> offer domain-specific customization and interpretable analysis. However, SLMs may lack relevant domain-specific mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities compared to proprietary LLMs due to limited relevant pre-trained knowledge. Despite these limitations, a customizable SLM fine-tuned on high-quality domain-specific datasets can achieve performance comparable to large-scale models while offering advantages like explainability and cost-effectiveness. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in exploring tool-augmented SLMs powered by external symbolic tools, numerical software tools, and APIs for program-guided solving that generates executable code to tackle complex mathematical problems. To overcome the drawbacks of limited domain-specific knowledge and better incorporate and utilize external knowledge from databases, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Instruction-Tuning (RAIT). RAIT technique enhances the capabilities of SLMs by combining Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) through external tool usage with instruction-tuning techniques. This approach uses both retrieved information and fine-tuned knowledge for generating code to solve chemical and process engineering problems. However, there are currently no publicly available high-quality labeled datasets of chemical and process engineering problems and solutions to customize SLMs through instruction-tuning. To address this gap, we have curated custom datasets from various scholarly sources suitable for the instruction-tuning of SLMs. The instruction-tuned SLMs utilize both internal parametric pre-trained knowledge and relevant external knowledge from tool invocation (e.g., numerical libraries and code documentation, Stack Overflow, Wolfram Alpha API) with chain-of-thought (CoT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wei2022chain</span>]</cite> reasoning to assist in code generation and debugging. In this work, we introduce an autonomous agent framework that can independently write, debug, and optimize code for solving complex process calculations fundamental to chemical process design, analysis, and optimization.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">The agentic framework combines instruction-tuned code-specific language models (such as Google Code Gemma or Meta Code Llama) with Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), utilizing the ReAct prompting technique for external knowledge retrieval and reasoning capabilities to generate code from natural language specifications. It follows a five-stage workflow: task planning to analyze the user query and break it into sub-tasks, tool selection to pick the best external tool for each sub-task, parameter extraction from the user query, tool invocation with the extracted parameters, and result integration to synthesize a comprehensive response. The agent can generate executable programs that strategically chain multiple tools to solve complex tasks, eliminating the need for manually designed pipelines. The framework caches successful programs for efficient reuse on similar future tasks. Additionally, it employs an attributable reflection mechanism to handle runtime errors. If such errors occur during program execution, this mechanism identifies the specific tool call causing the error and iteratively revises the program using tool documentation, error information, and program history. This process continues until the program executes successfully or reaches a fixed number of iterations, enabling iterative refinement and improvement of the generated code. The following sections will discuss the framework for solving process engineering problems in great detail, including comprehensive experiments to evaluate the proposed approach.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">In this work, we introduce an autonomous agent framework designed to write, debug, and optimize code for systematically solving complex chemical and process calculations, fundamental to the design, analysis, and optimization of the chemical process industry (CPI). The agent performs Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), utilizing advanced code-specific small language models (SLMs) such as Google CodeGemma<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite> or Meta CodeLlama<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> with the ReAct (Reason + Act) prompting<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> technique to understand and generate code from natural language specifications. Code SLMs lack pre-trained knowledge to generate code for solving chemical and process calculations. Conversely, fine-tuning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite> by incorporating relevant domain-specific knowledge offers task-specific customization of code SLMs to generate code for solving process calculations. While RACG techniques<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> allow code SLMs to access external tools<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite> for code generation, they are often not pre-trained to seamlessly incorporate retrieved information from invoking external tools, leading to less grounded and reliable answers. To address these issues, we utilize the RAIT approach to optimally adapt code SLMs through a fine-tuning technique for domain-specific RACG with tool usage, thus overcoming the limitations of both approaches: limited pre-trained knowledge and the inability to effectively leverage external tools. This leads to improved code generation. The ReAct (Reason + Act) technique enhances the capabilities of code SLMs by prompting them to generate verbal reasoning traces and task-specific actions, helping the code SLM plan and update actions while enabling tool usage to retrieve relevant information. Such tools include APIs like Stack Overflow and Wolfram Alpha, as well as scholarly sources such as code documentation. ReAct employs few-shot learning with examples of task-solving trajectories that include reasoning-action-observation steps, making the agent effective in knowledge-intensive tasks like code generation. This approach allows the agent to reason over external knowledge retrieved from tool usage, extending its capabilities beyond its pre-trained knowledge. We also utilize iterative code generation and refinement through a verify-then-correct approach, involving verification with external critiques to generate feedback and subsequent correction, ensuring the accuracy of the generated code. The autonomous agents operate with a five-stage workflow: task planning, tool selection, parameter extraction from user queries, tool invocation, and result integration. This structured approach maximizes the agents’ utility and effectively addresses a wide range of end-user queries through the strategic use of external tools. Task planning involves analyzing the user query to understand the high-level goal and then decomposing it into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. These sub-tasks are organized into a task dependency graph to ensure proper execution order. During tool selection, the most suitable tool is chosen to solve each sub-task from the external tool set. In the parameter extraction stage, the required parameters are extracted from the user query, and in the tool invocation stage, the tool is invoked with these parameters to obtain results. In response generation, the objective is to integrate multiple tool outputs with the code SLM’s internal knowledge to generate a comprehensive response. This involves the code language model synthesizing information from the tools and combining it with its fine-tuned knowledge to provide a detailed and accurate response, which may include summarizing the tool outputs. If the initial response is incomplete or requires refinement, an iterative feedback loop<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite> adjusts the task planning process, ensuring continuous improvement of the agent’s performance. For code LMs, tools include external resources such as APIs, software libraries, debugging tools, and knowledge bases like scholarly sources. Leveraging these tools enhances the code generation capabilities of autonomous agents, enabling them to execute, evaluate, and optimize code to meet specific requirements. Additionally, these tools help identify and resolve errors, facilitating better understanding, generation, and manipulation of code for solving complex chemical and process calculations. In summary, the proposed autonomous agent enables code SLMs to act as multi-tool users by generating programs that utilize a chain of tools, aiding in planning and executing complex tasks for solving practical chemical and process calculations. It addresses the limitations of existing ad hoc methods, where tool interaction workflows are manually designed and struggle to generalize to different scenarios. We implement program caching, storing generated programs that successfully complete tasks. This caching allows code SLMs to refer to these programs in future tasks, enabling efficient reuse of previously correct code. This memory of correct code helps reduce redundancy and enhances the efficiency of generating new programs for similar tasks. We illustrate the proposed framework’s operation in Tables <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#S2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 2 Proposed Method ‣ Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Process Engineering Calculations : A Tool-Chaining Problem-Solving Framework with Attributable Reflection"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>-<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#S2.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 2 Proposed Method ‣ Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Process Engineering Calculations : A Tool-Chaining Problem-Solving Framework with Attributable Reflection"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> by solving a dynamic modeling problem for a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) using numerical methods. The task begins with formulating a differential equation for the concentration of a reactant over time. Next, we select the appropriate tools—SciPy for solving differential equations, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for plotting results. Parameters are extracted from the user query, and the tools are invoked using a Reason + Act + Observe technique. This approach allows the autonomous agent to effectively integrate the outputs from multiple tools, culminating in a plot of the concentration profile over time. This example shows how the agent generates an accurate response by combining tool outputs with its internal knowledge.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1">The Retrieval-Augmented Instruction-Tuning (RAIT) technique, which combines tool-augmented RACG and instruction-tuning techniques, can enhance code SLMs’ capabilities in handling complex chemical and process engineering problems. To optimize their performance, code SLMs require extensive instruction-tuning using curated datasets to overcome the limitations of their lack of pre-training knowledge, ensuring familiarity with the terminology, methodologies, and typical problem-solving approaches in chemical and process engineering. Solving these problems demands a strong grasp of mathematical concepts and advanced computational tools (e.g., Python libraries). We address this by using instruction-tuning to equip code SLMs with both theoretical knowledge and computational tool learning, allowing them to utilize appropriate tools, thereby augmenting their domain-specific expertise for solving complex chemical and process engineering problems. We have curated a custom instruction-tuning dataset focused on mathematical modeling and numerical algorithms from academic sources and open repositories. The Mathematical and Computational Instruction-Tuning (MathComp) dataset comprises over 7,500 instruction-question-answer triplets designed to adapt code SLMs to computational tool usage, facilitating the generation of executable code to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), linear algebra problems, and optimization tasks. Additionally, we have custom-built a Chemical Process Instruction-Tuning (ChemProc) dataset of over 5,000 instruction-QA pairs from scholarly sources and public repositories. This dataset covers topics such as mass and energy balances, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, reaction kinetics and reactor design, fluid mechanics and transport phenomena, separation processes, process control, and optimization. The extensive training of code SLMs on these diverse datasets enables them to solve complex chemical and process engineering problems by leveraging domain-specific knowledge and advanced computational techniques.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.4">We utilized custom-built MathComp and ChemProc datasets essential for building and evaluating a robust framework capable of handling real-world complex chemical and process engineering problems. These benchmark datasets were split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test sets. Relevant scholarly sources (e.g., textbooks, Python libraries documentation) providing detailed explanations and examples of both numerical methods and chemical and process engineering problems were parsed using a sliding window technique to improve information retrieval. Text chunks were embedded and indexed, with metadata attached to each chunk, including the source document, section title, and chunk position. Images were processed using OpenAI GPT-4 (Omni) to generate text descriptions, which were then indexed for multi-modal search. Scholarly sources play a crucial role in providing high-quality, structured, and comprehensive information that enhances the framework’s ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant code solutions for complex engineering problems. We used the open-source BGE embedding method to retrieve relevant passages for knowledge-augmented code generation. To improve retrieval performance for code generation, we fine-tuned an embedding method to rank relevant documents higher by learning semantic relationships. We also used the BGE rerank model to prioritize the most relevant information and fine-tuned for domain adaptation to assign higher relevance scores to the most pertinent passages. The performance of the proposed framework was compared against proprietary models like GPT-4 (Omni), GPT-4 Turbo-preview, Claude-3 Opus, and Google Gemini Pro to ensure a comprehensive evaluation against general-purpose LLMs. We performed instruction-tuning of the code SLMs (Code Gemma-7b-it and Meta Code Llama-7b-hf) using Hugging Face’s PEFT library techniques like QLoRA on benchmark datasets for autoregressive code generation on consumer hardware. The code SLMs’ fine-tuning leveraged a comprehensive hyperparameter configuration: a batch size of 16, a learning rate of <math alttext="2\times 10^{-4}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><msup id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">2</cn><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1c">2\times 10^{-4}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1d">2 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math> adjusted with a constant scheduler over 50 epochs, 100 warmup steps, a weight decay of <math alttext="1\times 10^{-4}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1"><semantics id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><msup id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3a" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><times id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">1</cn><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">10</cn><apply id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1c">1\times 10^{-4}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1d">1 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math>, gradient accumulation of 5 steps, and the AdamW optimizer.

The table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#S3.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ Experimental Results: ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Process Engineering Calculations : A Tool-Chaining Problem-Solving Framework with Attributable Reflection"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> compares algorithms in response generation by BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match (EM). BLEU ranges from 0 (worst) to 1 (perfect). ROUGE-L ranges from 0 (no common subsequence) to 1 (perfect common subsequence). EM ranges from 0% (none match) to 100% (all match). The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework is effective; however, it lags slightly behind the proprietary models. We conducted several ablation studies to thoroughly evaluate our framework, which leverages the RAIT technique to enhance code SLMs for solving complex chemical and process engineering calculations. The ablation studies aim to isolate and quantify the contributions of key components: the ReAct (Reason + Act) prompting technique (without ReAct), integration of external knowledge (without Ext. Know), fine-tuning of code SLMs (without SLM Tuning), iterative code refinement (without Iter Refine) process with the attributable reflection mechanism, and program caching (without Caching). By systematically removing or disabling each component and observing the resulting performance changes, we measure their impact on key metrics. The baseline is the complete RAIT framework with all components enabled. These ablation studies ensure a thorough understanding of the framework’s strengths, demonstrating how each component contributes to the overall performance in solving specialized engineering problems.

This highlights the synergistic effect of the framework’s components and underscores the importance of incorporating all aspects for optimal performance in specialized engineering tasks.
A comprehensive human evaluation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite> approach is developed to evaluate the proposed RAIT framework. This framework is designed to augment code SLMs’ capabilities in solving complex chemical and process engineering calculations. The evaluation involves criteria including accuracy, relevance, coherence, comprehensiveness, and usability, assessed by both domain experts and general technical evaluators. Accuracy measures the correctness of the solutions, relevance assesses the appropriateness of the responses and selected tools, coherence evaluates the logical flow and readability, comprehensiveness checks the coverage and detail level, and usability determines the practicality and ease of integration of the generated code into workflows. Detailed guidelines ensure consistent scoring across these criteria, using a 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent) scale for each criterion. Both quantitative scores and qualitative feedback provide in-depth insights into the framework’s performance. The process involves expert evaluators analyzing results to identify strengths and weaknesses based on benchmark datasets. The table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#S3.T15" title="Table 15 ‣ Experimental Results: ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Process Engineering Calculations : A Tool-Chaining Problem-Solving Framework with Attributable Reflection"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a> presents the overall performance metrics for the RAIT framework, showing the mean scores across five evaluation criteria: accuracy, relevance, coherence, comprehensiveness, and usability. The scores range from 4.00 to 4.22 on a scale of 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent).</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p5.1">We introduce ‘Needle in a Haystack’ experiments to evaluate the RAIT framework using 100 Q&amp;A pairs from benchmark test sets. These experiments assess the framework’s ability to extract specific, relevant information from large knowledge bases to solve engineering problems. Key performance metrics include precision (the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant to the query), emphasizing minimization of false positives, and recall (the fraction of all relevant documents that were successfully retrieved), emphasizing minimization of false negatives. Additional metrics are the F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), accuracy of generated answers, relevance of retrieved documents, and coherence of responses. Results in Table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15866v1#S3.T20" title="Table 20 ‣ Experimental Results: ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Process Engineering Calculations : A Tool-Chaining Problem-Solving Framework with Attributable Reflection"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a> show that the RAIT framework achieves performance comparable to larger models in specialized tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex information retrieval and problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">In conclusion, the proposed RAIT technique effectively enhances code SLMs for complex chemical engineering calculations. By combining retrieval-augmented generation with instruction-tuning, the RAIT technique addresses the limitations of code SLMs in specialized tasks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIT’s techniques, rivaling larger language models in domain-specific applications. Our work offers a promising direction for developing efficient, specialized AI tools within the chemical process industry. Future work should focus on developing more comprehensive and diverse datasets for instruction-tuning, incorporating a wider range of external tools and APIs, and exploring advanced techniques for knowledge retrieval and integration. Additionally, investigating ways to improve the framework’s explainability and interpretability would be valuable for building trust and facilitating adoption in industrial settings.</p>
