<p id="id23.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of large-scale distributed clients without data sharing. However, due to the disparity of computing resources among massive mobile computing devices, the performance of traditional homogeneous model-based Federated Learning (FL) is seriously limited.
On the one hand, to achieve model training in all the diverse clients, mobile computing systems can only use small low-performance models for collaborative learning. On the other hand, devices with high computing resources cannot train a high-performance large model with their insufficient raw data.
To address the resource-constrained problem in mobile computing systems, we present a novel heterogeneous FL approach named AdapterFL, which uses a model reassemble strategy to facilitate collaborative training of massive heterogeneous mobile devices adaptively.
Specifically, we select multiple candidate heterogeneous models based on the computing performance of massive mobile devices and then divide each heterogeneous model into two partitions.
By reassembling the partitions, we can generate models with varied sizes that are combined by the partial parameters of the large model with the partial parameters of the small model.
Using these reassembled models for FL training, we can train the partial parameters of the large model using low-performance devices.
In this way, we can alleviate performance degradation in large models due to resource constraints.
The experimental results show that AdapterFL can achieve up to 12% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the improvement of the capability of mobile Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing chips and the relevant hardware of mobile devices, AI applications based on mobile computing are becoming a trend <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Although Web of Things (WoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> technologies enable efficient communication and data transmission between different devices, the data collected by mobile devices such as mobile phones and wearable devices usually involves user privacy.
Due to concerns about the risk of privacy leakage, the traditional centralized paradigm, which collects all the data in a central cloud, is challenging to satisfy mobile computing requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a well-known distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> enables various clients to train a global AI model without data sharing collaboratively.
Due to the advantage of privacy protection, FL has been widely used in mobile computing and WoT applications, such as real-time systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, IoT systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and autonomous driving systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In each FL round, the cloud server dispatches a global model to multiple clients for local training. Each client uses its raw data to train the received model and then uploads the trained model to the cloud server.
By aggregating uploaded models, the cloud server generates a new global model for local training of the next FL round.
In this way, the cloud server achieves model training without leaking privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL is promising in privacy protection due to using the same global model for local training, there still exist three challenges in mobile computing and WoT systems.
The first challenge is the heterogeneity of the devices in the WoT systems.
Since the computing capability of hardware resources (e.g., CUP and GPUs) in WoT devices is quite different <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, as the bucket effect reveals, for traditional FL, the selection of the global model depends on the lowest-performance device.
In other words, the cloud server has to select the small low-performance model as the global model, which causes i) the hardware resources of high-performance devices not to be fully utilized and ii) high-performance devices to be deployed in a low-performance model with poor inference accuracy.
The second challenge is that the data of each device is limited.
Due to the data limitation of each device, it is difficult to train a usable high-performance model on a small group of high-performance devices.
The third challenge is that device data are typically non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Since WoT devices are deployed in different physical environments, the distributions of their collected data are affected by environments and user preferences, resulting in the problem of “client drift” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and causing the inference accuracy degradation of the aggregated global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the performance of FL, existing methods can be classified into two categories, i.e., homogeneous methods and heterogeneous methods.
Homogeneous FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> still use the same model as the global model for local training. This goal aims to use a wisely model training mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, device selection mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, or a data processing mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to improve the inference performance of the global model.
Although homogeneous FL methods can alleviate performance degradation caused by non-IID data, their performance is still limited due to existing low-performance devices.
The heterogeneous methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> attempt to dispatch multiple heterogeneous models to different devices for local training. In this way, high-performance devices can train a larger model rather than a low-performance small model. The cloud server can enable knowledge transfer among heterogeneous models using hyper-networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> or knowledge distillation technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Although these heterogeneous methods can improve resource utilization, it is usually challenging to ensure that all the models achieve usable performance due to resource constraints, such as limited data on high-performance devices.
In addition, existing heterogeneous methods usually rely on a specific structure of the hyper-network without considering the heterogeneity of device hardware.
Specifically, different hardware architectures result in different processing capabilities for different model structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, such as convolutional layers and fully connected layers.
Therefore, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to improve FL performance in resource-constrained scenarios is a serious challenge for AI applications in mobile computing and WoT systems.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, although heterogeneous models have different structures, these models can be divided into multiple similar function modules, such as feature extraction and classification modules.
Intuitively, if modules with the same functions in the large-size model can be grafted into the small-size model, we can attempt to use low-performance devices to train partial model parameters. In this way, the partial parameters of the large-size model can be trained more adequately, and then their inference performance can be improved.
Many recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> have observed that early layers of a network tend to capture low-level, general features, while as the network becomes deeper, the features become more abstract and task-specific.
Inspired by the above observation, the heterogeneous models can be divided into two blocks, i.e., a feature-extraction block and a device-adaptation block.
By grafting the device-adaptation block from different heterogeneous models to the same feature-extraction block, we can generate multiple reassembled models, where the feature-extraction block can be trained by all the devices to extract the general features, and the device-adaptation block can be selected according to the hardware resource of the devices.
All the device-adaptation blocks are used to perform specific tasks according to the extracted features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the motivation above, we propose AdapterFL, a novel heterogeneous federated learning framework that implements collaborative training between heterogeneous models through model partition and reassembly.
In AdpaterFL, the cloud server selects multiple heterogeneous prototype models according to the hardware resource of the devices and divides each prototype model into two blocks, i.e., the feature-extraction block and the device-adaptation block, respectively.
The cloud server then reassembles these blocks into a group of models with the same feature-extraction block.
These reassembled models are dispatched to local devices for local training in each FL training round.
When the model aggregation process is performed, the cloud server aggregates blocks with the same structure.
In this way, AdapterFL can enable FL to adaptively select heterogeneous models according to the hardware resource of the devices.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Heterogeneous Federated Learning.</span> Basic FL methods are based on the assumption that all clients have sufficient resources. However, when clients’ resources are constrained, these methods are no longer applicable. So far, many FL methods for this problem have been proposed. Some existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> address this problem with heterogeneous models based on knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For example, FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> enhances the performance of models by distilling from the ensemble of predictions of heterogeneous local models, and HetComp <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> reduces the huge inference costs while retaining high accuracy. However, these distillation-based methods require a public proxy dataset, which is often impractical. In addition, some works prune the global model into heterogeneous sub-models to solve the problem of model heterogeneity. For example, HereroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and Split-Mix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> prune the global model by variant widths for clients with different resources and aggregate overlapping parameters of sub-models to share knowledge. However, they may have performance limitations since pruning the model by widths will destroy the model structure and cause parameter mismatch during aggregation. By pruning the model by variant depths, DepthFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> circumvents this problem and further improves performance through self-distillation on clients. Other related methods, such as InclusiveFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and FlexiFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, improve the accuracy by aggregating heterogeneous models’ common parts. However, these methods are limited by the overall architecture of models and must be applied to heterogeneous models with similar architecture. Our method is to solve the problem of model heterogeneity through model partition and reassembly, which is not limited by model architecture.</p>

Knowledge transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> aims at transferring the knowledge learned by a model in a domain across others. There are a lot of existing knowledge transfer works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
A typical method in knowledge is to split the model into a lower (common) part and a higher (specific) part so that the knowledge learned by the former about an ML task can be shared with other ML tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
DeRy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> is a novel knowledge-transfer method that proposes a model partition and reassembly method for pre-trained models. DeRy leverages the representations’ similarity to quantify the distance among neural networks. It divides each neural network into several building blocks according to the similarity so that building blocks in the same position from different models can play similar roles and extract common features in the neural network. Then, this method can rearrange the building blocks from various neural networks in positional order to reassemble new models. AdpaterFL leverages the model partition method to divide the prototype model into two blocks, the lower feature-extraction block and the higher device-adaptation block, and rearranges them to reassemble more new models. The reassembled models with the same feature-extraction block can extract general features to achieve the purpose of knowledge transfer. Therefore, they can serve as a group of models for the problem of model heterogeneity in the resource-constrained scenario.</p>

To adapt to various devices with limited resources, AdapterFL includes a model &amp; client selector, which collects hardware information from WoT devices to i) select prototype models and ii) assign heterogeneous global models for each device.
The workflow of AdapterFL consists of two stages, i.e., the initial model generation stage and the FL training stage respectively.
The initial model generation stage selects multiple prototype models according to the different hardware resources of WoT devices and reassembles these prototype models to generate multiple heterogeneous global models for FL training.
The FL training stage dispatches the generated heterogeneous models to WoT devices for local training according to their hardware resources and then aggregates the trained models to update global models.</p>

Typically, the size difference of feature-extraction blocks is much smaller than that of device-adaptation blocks.
In the model reassembly step, the cloud server selects a feature-extraction block from the divided feature-extraction blocks in the first step and reassembles it with all the device-adaptation blocks to generate multiple initial heterogeneous global models.

In this way, the cloud server can select a more suitable global model according to the hardware resource of the target device.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In the model reassembling step, the cloud server selects a feature-extraction block from the divided feature-extraction blocks in the model partition step.
Note that since the sizes of different divided feature-extraction blocks are similar, to generate higher-performance models, the cloud server prefers to select the feature-extraction block divided from a large-size model for model reassembling.
By combining the selected feature-extraction block with all device-adaptation blocks, the cloud server can generate a group of new reassembled models.
However, since the feature-extraction block and the target device-adaptation block may come from different models, their feature dimensions are mismatched.
To achieve reassembling between heterogeneous blocks, the cloud server generates an adapter for each reassembly model to align the dimensions.
In our framework, the adapter contains two convolutional layers, which will be attached to the feature-extraction block and the device-adaptation block, respectively. By the connecting of an adapter, a feature-extraction block <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m_{i}^{ex}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup

To achieve sufficient training of the global models, our device selection strategy ensures that each heterogeneous global model is dispatched to at least one device for training in each FL training round.
Moreover, the number of devices to dispatch for a global model at each round is determined according to the number of suitable devices for this global model.</p>

In simple terms, our method aggregates blocks with a common structure. Since shared blocks are aggregated from different heterogeneous models, they can share the knowledge between heterogeneous models by extracting the general features.
Compared with the small model, the large model has stronger generalization and higher performance limits but requires more computing resources. The large model may suffer from insufficient model training problems in resource-constrained scenarios. However, in AdapterFL, since these heterogeneous models have the same lower feature-extraction block that can extract general features, we can perform knowledge sharing and migration between heterogeneous models and jointly improve overall performance through the joint aggregation of the lower block among heterogeneous models. In addition, generally speaking, the feature-extraction block of a large prototype model has stronger knowledge transfer and feature extraction capabilities than a small prototype model.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of AdapterFL, we conducted extensive experiments based on a variety of
well-known datasets and models.
All the experiment results were collected
from a Ubuntu workstation equipped with an Intel i9 CPU, 32GB memory, and an NVIDIA RTX 3090Ti GPU.
We implemented the AdapterFL framework
on top of Pytroch (version 2.0.1). The following

In FedAvg and FedDF, S, M, and L represent three prototype models, e.g., L indicates the prototype model of ResNet18. In our method, we can obtain 3 groups of models, and each group contains 3 heterogeneous reassembled models composed of the same feature-extraction block. For example, the L-group includes 3 models: L-S, L-M, and L-L, and model L-M represents the reassembled model by combining the feature-extraction block of prototype model L and the device-adaptation block of prototype model M. We can observe that AdapterFL achieves the highest accuracy among all the mentioned methods in all levels of models by using the L-group. By the block-based aggregation, AdapterFL can outperform FedBase by <math id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.44\%,7.23\%,14.28\%" display="inline"><semantics

Compared to FedDF, which only improves the accuracy of the L and M model using additional global data by distilling, AdapterFL not only enhances the accuracy of model L-M and L-L, but it also works on model L-S without using the proxy dataset. Even in some cases, models with fewer parameters have higher accuracy. For different data distributions, AdapterFL can still perform better than other baselines.</p>

By comparing the results of different groups, we can find performance differences between different groups of reassembled models. This is mainly because different feature-extraction blocks have different capabilities in extracting features, which is also the reason why the performance of the S-group is poor. We can observe that reassembled models composed of the feature-extraction block from the large prototype model outperform the model composed of the feature-extraction block from the small prototype model at the same parameter level, e.g., the model L-S outperforms model S-S by <math id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="7.61\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">7.61</mn><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">7.61</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">7.61\%</annotation></semantics></math> in FedBase and <math id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6.24\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">6.24</mn><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">6.24</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">6.24\%</annotation></semantics></math> in AdapterFL.

We can calculate that the parameters are mainly concentrated on the device-adaptation block. Since the variation of the number of parameters in feature-extraction blocks and the addition of adapters, the number of parameters of reassembled models in AdapterFL is slightly
higher than that of corresponding prototype models.
However, through the collaborative aggregation of feature-extraction blocks between heterogeneous models, AdapterFL can improve the overall performance of models by general feature extraction and knowledge transfer.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the scalability of AdapterFL, we conducted experiments at different client resource ratios and compared AdapterFL with different baselines, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ V-C2 Impacts of Models: ‣ V-C Adaptivity Analysis (RQ2) ‣ V Experiments ‣ AdapterFL: Adaptive Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Resource-constrained Mobile Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. As we thought, the model’s overall performance will improve as the proportion of resource-constrained clients decreases. Not only will the accuracy of large models be improved, but that of small models will also be significantly improved. This is because as the proportion of clients with sufficient resources gradually increases, large models can be better trained and their feature-extraction block can more fully utilize its capabilities to extract the common feature.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we first introduced the resource-constrained issue in actual scenarios and then discussed the challenge of FL: model heterogeneity. Then, We proposed AdapterFL, a heterogeneous FL framework based on model partition and reassembly for model heterogeneity. Our method does not need additional datasets and can still work on models with different architectures. Compared with state-of-the-art FL frameworks, AdpaterFL improves model accuracy significantly in the resource-limited scenario. We also proved the adaptivity and scalability of our method through experiments.</p>
