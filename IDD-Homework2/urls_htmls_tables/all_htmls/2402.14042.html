<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id17.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Preservation of private user data is of paramount importance for high Quality of Experience (QoE) and acceptability, particularly with services treating sensitive data, such as IT-based health services. Whereas anonymization techniques were shown to be prone to data re-identification, synthetic data generation has gradually replaced anonymization since it is relatively less time and resource-consuming and more robust to data leakage. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating synthetic datasets, especially GAN frameworks adhering to the <span id="id17.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">differential privacy</span> phenomena.
This research compares state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns. Predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and distribution analysis are used to assess the Quality of Generating (QoG) of the generated data. The privacy preservation of the respective models is assessed by applying membership inference attacks to determine potential data leakage risks. Our experiments indicate the superiority of the privacy-preserving GAN (PPGAN) model over other models regarding privacy preservation while maintaining an acceptable level of QoG. The presented results can support better data protection for medical use cases in the future.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The current General Data Protection Directive (GDPR) limits access and distribution of personal medical records, making it difficult to develop applications and train deep learning models due to restricted data access. Generating high-quality synthetic data is a necessary requirement for the improvement of patients’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Publicly available data for training interactive systems in the medical domain is scarce due to security and privacy reasons. Whereas this data is needed for training algorithms that enable adaptation of the user interface and content to match the preference and abilities of users, all of which would directly contribute to an improved patient’s QoE. For data-driven approaches in the medical domain, having sufficient training data while maintaining anonymity and data utility is crucial. This is especially true for deep learning models used in domains like natural language processing and information retrieval, where a substantial amount of training data is a basic requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Although a significant amount of data is available in healthcare, it cannot be utilized for machine learning applications due to the GDPR restrictions. This limits the deployment of deep learning models in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Anonymizing medical records has been proposed as a solution to this problem and has become a popular method for making real medical records available for public research. However, many of these approaches have proven to be fragile against re-identification attacks. Synthetic data generation by applying deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offers higher data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. GAN models for synthetic text data are rapidly evolving to meet the demand for privacy-preserving data sharing in research. However, classical GANs have the ability to remember training samples, making it possible to re-identify personal-related information. Other approaches such as diffusion models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> have been suggested as potential alternatives for GANs in synthetic data generation while privacy issues are not addressed for this approach and the main focus has so far stayed on the data utility. Hence, we will use GANs for our use case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent GAN-based frameworks have introduced innovative ideas to improve the quality of generated data and enhance privacy at the same time, such as integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms. However, generating synthetic data is challenging due to the data utility and privacy trade-off. The privacy-utility trade-off refers to the idea that in certain situations, increasing the privacy of data generation may come at the cost of reducing the quality. Achieving an effective balance between the two factors can be a challenging task, as finding suitable GAN approaches is not a straightforward process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The main research question of this contribution is: Can high-quality synthetic datasets for time series medical records be generated while safeguarding privacy?
In this paper, various GAN-based models are utilized to explore their performance with respect to data utility and privacy. Five GAN-based data generation frameworks have been trained, namely simpleGAN, medGAN, DoppelGANger (DG), Differentially Private GAN (DPGAN), and Privacy Preserving GAN (PPGAN). The objective of using a dementia patients’ dataset to generate synthetic data is to create new data with a high quality of generation (QoG), while also ensuring strong privacy protection. This privacy-preserving high-quality data can also be used for <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">extending</em> existing datasets to foster medical research for machine learning applications.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Legal regulations, such as the GDPR, require the anonymization of personal data. However, clear guidelines are still lacking facilitating the development of precise and uniform approaches to preserve the privacy of personal information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Overall, anonymization refers to the exclusion or removal of personal identifiers.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation emerged to mitigate the re-identification of individuals. Hereby, most of the machine learning frameworks, such as Autoregressive models (AR), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) used for the synthetic data generation approach are data-type specific <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, most models often do not consider metadata and time series sequences, failing to capture complex temporal dependencies. Whereas, in the healthcare domain, most datasets contain time series and sequences. Hereby, Anonymization and ML-based generative models for synthetic medical data generation did not provide ideal data utility and privacy. Thus, GAN-based approaches have been proven to outperform VAE, RNN, and AR for the synthetic data generation task.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the earlier contributions applying GANs for synthetic medical records generation is medGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This framework cannot sample time series and sequential data and considers the whole dataset as one large matrix. However, medGAN motivated the development of other GAN frameworks capable of handling discrete and continuous features. Still, these models do not address privacy-preserving mechanisms but yield a good QoG performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. One approach addressing privacy preserving <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">deep learning</span> mechanisms to generate synthetic data from labeled but also unlabeled data is PATE-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This approach uses <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Private Aggregation of Teaching Ensembles</span> to ensure differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A further model developed based on medGAN is ADS-GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> which manipulates the classic GAN architecture to improve the QoG by feeding additional input to the GAN’s generator and discriminator. Additionally, <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADS-GAN</span> uses Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGANGP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to mitigate the mode collapse problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Despite the improved QoG and privacy robustness compared to <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">WGAN</span> and medGAN, ADS-GAN is still not designed to capture sequential and time series data distribution.
A more recent approach for synthetic data generation is DG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which utilizes GANs to enable the synthetic generation of complex, sequential data sets. DG is a generic framework that can take data samples from various datasets and still achieve a high QoG. DG can generate data features conditioned on data attributes, handle extreme events, and prevents mode collapse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Concerning <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">differential privacy</span>, DG provides the possibility of including DPGAN in their training process, to add noise to the training samples. However, the added noise results in a drastic reduction of the QoG.</p>

The datasets were pre-processed for each task/experiment based on its requirements. We decided to keep the date feature representing the date on which, a user used the game in our original dataset. However, we did not need to include the date column in the generation process since it is not considered an important feature. Similarly, the <span id="S3.SS1.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user_id</span> representing the ID number of each user was also excluded from the dataset after creating the sequences.
Several data pre-processing steps were conducted to prepare the data for the GAN-based models. The <span id="S3.SS1.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user_mmst</span> values representing the Mini-Mental-Status-Test (MMST) scores for each user, have been taken to generate sequences. Then for each dataset, we stacked all the sequences on top of each other to have a more organized dataset, and we clipped the sequences that were larger than a threshold (maximum sequence length). We configured the threshold for each data empirically based on their sequence length to keep all the datasets in a reasonably similar size (5K-8K rows), otherwise, the comparison would not yield fair results.
In some autocorrelation evaluation steps, we needed to represent each patient in one row of data. To accomplish this, we calculated the mean value for each column in each sequence and returned it as a single value for the respective column. As a result, we had a small dataset of 56 rows (one row per user) in which any value represented the mean value of all rows for a specific patient.
For the evaluation, if the prediction performance increases, when the original dataset is extended by the synthetically generated data, the synthetic data, and real data are merged.</p>

We can observe an almost sharp interval for the real and DG datasets at the beginning of the graph with convergence towards the higher lags. Whereas the graph in the case of medGAN and simpleGAN starts with an early convergence after a drastic drop at the beginning. PPGAN’s graph, on the other hand, has a gradual convergence but it does not have minus values at the beginning of the graph unlike DG and the real datasets. Additionally, DPGAN’s graph does not resemble the fluctuating pattern of the real data. Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV Results ‣ Protect and Extend - Using GANs for Synthetic Data Generation of Time-Series Medical Records" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the same autocorrelation graphs but on the averaged dataset where all the columns per patient is averaged to have a single row representing each patient’s data. In this case, more resemblance between the real and medGAN data is visible for the averaged datasets. <span id="S4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DG’s</span> pattern follows a similar pattern by gradually dropping from positive to negative and then raising back towards 0, except for a few cases around index 20 on the <span id="S4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">x</span> axis. The autocorrelation of both DPGAN and PPGAN for the averaged datasets looks relatively similar where none of the models exactly mimic the real dataset’s pattern. Overall, medGAN, DG, and PPGAN show more similar autocorrelations to the real <span id="S4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user_mmst</span> values than the other models which is an indication of a higher QoG of these datasets.</p>

We observed that the <span id="S4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user_mmst</span> values generated by medGAN and simpleGAN, follow a random Gaussian distribution whereas DG and PPGAN have a scattered distribution with more resemblance to the real dataset. Furthermore, DPGAN has faced a mode collapse situation with more than 90% of its labeling values having a similar value. This might also suggest that the LSTM model has treated the values generated by the DPGAN(DG) as outliers (recall <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV Results ‣ Protect and Extend - Using GANs for Synthetic Data Generation of Time-Series Medical Records" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

The second-best performance belonged to DG achieving an F1 score of <math id="S5.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.57" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">0.57</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.3.m3.1.1">0.57</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.3.m3.1c">0.57</annotation></semantics></math> and a very low RMSE value of <math id="S5.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S5.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">0.01</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.4.m4.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.4.m4.1.1">0.01</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.4.m4.1c">0.01</annotation></semantics></math>. (2) however, for the autocorrelation analysis medGAN showed the highest similarity with the original dataset, followed by DG and PPGAN. (3) When comparing the different models according to the sequence length the distribution of simpleGAN, medGAN, and PPGAN showed the highest similarity with the original distribution of the <span id="S5.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user_mmst</span> values Although PPGAN appeared to be the most convenient model among all the QoG categories, a particular model could not be determined as significantly outperforming other models in all three aspects of determining the QoG.
When comparing the different GAN-based approaches in terms of privacy, PPGAN clearly outperforms the other approaches when applying membership inference attacks. Hereby, PPGAN achieved a very low AUC value of <math id="S5.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.55" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.5.m5.1a"><mn id="S5.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S5.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">0.55</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.5.m5.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.5.m5.1.1">0.55</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.5.m5.1c">0.55</annotation></semantics></math> indicating a random inference attack. Also, the AA value was very low (<math id="S5.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.09" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.6.m6.1a"><mn id="S5.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S5.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">0.09</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.6.m6.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.6.m6.1.1">0.09</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.6.m6.1c">0.09</annotation></semantics></math>). Thus, PPGAN has shown a lower risk of data leakage while at the same time keeping an acceptable QoG</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Achieving high predictive model accuracy - despite having paramount importance in the case of medical data - is still an open challenge given an insufficient amount of data. additionally, there are no existing standard thresholds when accuracy is ultimately judged as sufficient. Hence, achieving higher model accuracy needs to be addressed in future work regarding the generation of synthetic medical data.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have used state-of-the-art, GAN-based, synthetic data generation frameworks to generate synthetic medical records from a dataset containing time series medical records about dementia patients. The GAN-based models, namely simpleGAN, medGAN, DG, DPGAN, and PPGAN have been compared based on three aspects of predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and sequence length wherein PPGAN has appeared as the dominant model overall categories. In terms of privacy aspects, PPGAN outperformed other models when subjected to membership inference attacks and showed a low risk of re-identification of patients. Thus, PPGAN is recommended for generating synthetic medical records, keeping an acceptable balance between privacy preservation and QoG. Since this analysis has been conducted on a single dataset, our claim only applies to scenarios in which similar datasets are used, plus an optimistic anticipation of gaining comparable results on different datasets.
Overall, the analysis shows that there is room for future research on improving the QoG and privacy aspects of the state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation. Furthermore, by using suggested models, it is possible to develop services and platforms that provide a high QoE while guaranteeing privacy preservation.</p>
