<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables collaboratively training a model while keeping the training data decentralized and private. However, one significant impediment to training a model using FL, especially large models, is the resource constraints of devices with heterogeneous computation and communication capacities as well as varying task sizes.
Such heterogeneity would render significant variations in the training time of clients, resulting in a longer overall training time as well as a waste of resources in faster clients. To tackle these heterogeneity issues, we propose the Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning (DTFL) system where slower clients dynamically offload part of the model to the server to alleviate resource constrains and speed up training. By leveraging the concept of Split Learning, DTFL offloads different portions of the global model to clients in different tiers and enables each client to update the models in parallel via local-loss-based training. This helps reduce the computation and communication demand on resource-constrained devices and thus mitigates the straggler problem.
DTFL introduces a dynamic tier scheduler that uses tier profiling to estimate the expected training time of each client, based on their historical training time, communication speed, and dataset size. The dynamic tier scheduler assigns clients to suitable tiers to minimize the overall training time in each round.
We first theoretically prove the convergence properties of DTFL. We then train large models (ResNet-56 and ResNet-110) on popular image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and HAM10000) under both IID and non-IID systems. Extensive experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art FL methods, DTFL can significantly reduce the training time while maintaining model accuracy.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), which allows clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data with others, has become a popular privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm.
In FL, clients update the global model using their locally trained weights to avoid sharing raw data with the server or other clients. This training process, however, becomes a significant hurdle for training large models when clients are resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile/IoT devices, and edge servers) with heterogeneous computation and communication capacities in addition to different dataset sizes. Such heterogeneity would incur a significant impact on training time and model accuracy in conventional FL systems (i.e., larger training time is required to reach similar accuracy compared to non-heterogeneous systems) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Abdelmoniem et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train large models with resource-constrained devices, various methods have been proposed in the literature. One solution is to split the global model into a client-side model (i.e., the first a few layers of the global model) and a server-side model, where the clients only need to train the small client-side model via Split Learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gupta &amp; Raskar (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Vepakomma et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> improves model training speed in split federated learning (SFL) by giving local clients control over both the local updating frequency and batch size.
However, in SFL, each client needs to wait for the back-propagated gradients from the server to update its model, and the communication overhead for transmitting the forward/backward signals between the server and clients can be substantial at each training round (i.e., time needed to complete a round of training).
To address these issues, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Cho et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> uses a knowledge transfer training algorithm, to train small models at clients and periodically transfer their knowledge via knowledge distillation to a large server-side model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> develops a federated SL algorithm that addresses the latency and communication issues by integrating local-loss-based training into SL. However, the client-side models in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> are fixed throughout the training process, and choosing suitable client-side models in heterogeneous environments is challenging as the resources of clients may change over time.
Another solution is to divide clients into tiers based on their training speed and select clients from the same tier in each training round to mitigate the straggler problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, existing tier-based works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> still require clients to train the entire global model, which is not suitable for training large models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning (DTFL) system, to speed up FL for training large models in heterogeneous environments. DTFL aims to not only incorporate benefits from both SFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and tier-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, but also address the latency issues and reduce the training time of these works in heterogeneous environments. In DTFL, we divide clients into different tiers. In different tiers, DTFL offloads different portions of the global model from each client to the server. Then each client and the server update the models in parallel using local-loss-based training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nøkland &amp; Eidnes (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Belilovsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Huo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
In a heterogeneous environment, the training time of each client can change over time. Static tier assignments can result in severe straggler issues when clients with limited computation and communication resources (e.g., due to other concurrently running applications on mobile devices) are allocated to tiers demanding high levels of resources. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic tier scheduler that assigns clients to suitable tiers based on their capacities, their task size, and their current training speed. The tier scheduler employs tier profiling to estimate client-side training time, using only the measured training time, communicated network speed, and observed dataset size of clients, making it a low-overhead solution which is suitable for real system implementation. We theoretically show the convergence of DTFL on convex and non-convex loss functions under standard assumptions in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Reisizadeh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and local-loss-based training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Belilovsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Huo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
Using DTFL, we train large models (ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>) on different number of clients using popular datasets (CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Krizhevsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>, CIFAR-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Krizhevsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>, CINIC-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Darlow et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, and HAM10000<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tschandl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>) and their non-I.I.D. (non-identical and independent distribution) variants.
We also evaluate the performance of DTFL when employing privacy measures, such as minimizing the distance correlation between raw data and intermediate representations, and shuffling patches of data. The results indicate that DTFL can effectively incorporate privacy techniques without significantly impacting model accuracy.
Extensive experimental results show that DTFL can significantly reduce the training time while maintaining model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art FL methods.</p>

Existing FL methods (see a comprehensive study of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>) require clients to repeatedly download and update the global model, which is not suitable for training large models with resource-constrained devices in heterogeneous environments and may suffer a severe straggler problem. To address the straggler problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> selects a smaller set of clients for training in each global iteration, but requires more training rounds. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> mitigates stragglers by neglecting the slowest 30% clients, while FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> uses distinct local epoch numbers for clients. Both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> face the challenge of determining the perfect parameters (i.e., percentage of slowest clients and number of local epochs). Recently, tier-based FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Reisizadeh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> propose to divide clients into tiers based on their training speed and select clients from the same tier in each training round to mitigate the straggler problem.
However, clients in existing FL methods are required to train the whole global model, which renders significant hurdles in training large models on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Split Learning.</span>
To tackle the computational limitation of resource-constrained devices, Split Learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Vepakomma et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Gupta &amp; Raskar (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> splits the global model into a client-side model and a server-side model, and clients need to only update the small client-side model, compared to FL.
To increase SL training speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thapa et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> incorporated FL into SL, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a first-parallel-then-sequential approach that clusters clients and sequentially trains a model in SL fashion in each cluster, and then transfers the updated cluster model to the next clusters.
In SL, clients must wait for the server’s backpropagated gradients to update their models, which can cause significant communication overhead.
To address these issues, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> proposes FedGKT, to train small models at clients and periodically transfer their knowledge by knowledge distillation to a large server-side model.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> develops a federated SL algorithm that addresses latency and communication issues by integrating local-loss-based training. Clients train a model using local error signals, which eliminates the need to communicate with the server.
However, the client-side models in current SL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> are fixed throughout the training process, and choosing suitable client-side models in heterogeneous environments is challenging as clients’ resources may change over time. Compared to these works, the proposed DTFL can dynamically adjust the size of the client-side model for each client over time, which can significantly reduce the
training time and mitigate the straggler problem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One main drawback of existing federated optimization techniques (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al.

Such heterogeneity would lead to the severe straggler problem that clients may have significantly different response latencies (i.e., the time between a client receives the training task and returning the results) in the FL process, which would severely slow down the training (see experimental results in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Training Time Improvement of DTFL ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, we propose a Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning (DTFL) system (see Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Problem Statement ‣ 3 Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), in which we develop a dynamic tier scheduler
that assigns clients to suitable tiers based on their training
speed. In different tiers, DTFL offloads different portions of the global model to clients and enables each client to update the models
in parallel via local-loss-based training, which can reduce
the computation and communication demand on resource-constrained devices, while mitigating the straggler problem. Compared with existing works (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Han et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Chai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>), which can be treated as a single-tier case in DTFL, DTFL provides more flexibility via multiple tiers to cater to a variety of heterogeneous resource-constrained devices in heterogeneous environments.
As shown in experimental results in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Training Time Improvement of DTFL ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>, DTFL can significantly reduce the training time while maintaining model accuracy, compared with these methods.</p>

As the capacities of each client in a heterogeneous environment may change over time, a static tier assignment may still lead to a severe straggler problem. The key question is how to efficiently solve (<a href="#S3.E8" title="In 3.3 Dynamic Tier Scheduling ‣ 3 Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) in a heterogeneous environment.</p>

We adopt the approach of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Belilovsky et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> for local-loss-based training, where the server input distribution varies over time and depends on client-side model convergence.</p>

We conducted the experiment using Python 3.11.3 and the PyTorch library version 1.13.1, which is available online in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sajjadi Mohammadabadi, Seyed Mahmoud (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. The DTFL and the baselines are deployed in a server, which is equipped with dual-sockets Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz with hyper-threading disabled, and four NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, 64 GB of memory.
Each client is assigned a different simulated CPU and communication resource in order to simulate heterogeneous resources (i.e., simulate the training time of different CPU/network profiles). By using these resource profiles, we simulate a heterogeneous environment where clients’ capacity varies in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings.
We consider 5 resource profiles: 4 CPUs with 100 Mbps, 2 CPUs with 30 Mbps, 1 CPU with 30 Mbps, 0.2 CPU with 30 Mbps, and 0.1 CPU with 10 Mbps communication speed to the server. Each client is assigned one resource profile at the beginning of the training, and the profile can be changed during the training process to simulate the dynamic environment.</p>

DTFL is a versatile approach suitable for training a wide range of neural network models (e.g., Multilayer Perceptron, MLP, Recurrent Neural Networks, RNN, and CNN), particularly benefiting large-scale models. In the experiments, we evaluate large CNN models, ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> that work well on the selected datasets. Furthermore, DTFL can also be applied to large language models (LLM) like BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> by splitting techniques as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Lit et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
For each tier, we split a global model to create client and server-side models. The split layer is different in tiers, and it moves toward the last layer as the tier increases. For each client-side model, we add a fully connected (f.c.) and an average pooling (avgpool) layer as the auxiliary network. More details can be found in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS5" title="A.5 Model Architecture ‣ Appendix A More details about experiments ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.5</span></a>.
We follow the same setting as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> for FedGKT. We split the global model after module 2 (as defined in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS5" title="A.5 Model Architecture ‣ Appendix A More details about experiments ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.5</span></a>) for the SplitFed model.</p>

The experiments were conducted on a heterogeneous client population, with 20% assigned to each profile at the experiment’s outset. Every 50 rounds, the client profiles (i.e., number of simulated CPUs and communication speed) of 30% of the clients were randomly changed to simulate a dynamic environment, while all clients participated in every training round.
The training time of each method to achieve a target accuracy is provided in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Training Time Improvement of DTFL ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic Tiering Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. In all cases for both I.I.D. and non-I.I.D. settings, DTFL significantly reduces the training time, compared to baselines (FedAvg, SplitFed, FedYogi, FedGKT). For example, DTFL reduces the training time of FedAvg by 80% to reach the target accuracy on I.I.D. CIFAR-10 with ResNet-110.
This experiment illustrates the capabilities of DTFL which can significantly reduce training time when training on distributed heterogeneous clients.

to reach the target accuracy of 80%, the training time generally decreases with the number of tiers, as DTFL would have more flexibility to fine-tune the tier of each client based on the heterogeneous resources of each client.</p>

A potential threat to DTFL is model inversion attacks, extracting client data by analyzing feature maps or model parameter transfers from clients to servers.
Prior research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Zhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> has shown that attackers need access to all model parameters or gradients to recover client data. This is not feasible from partial or fragmented models.
Thus, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thapa et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, DTFL can use separate servers for model aggregation and training to prevent a single server from having access to all model parameters and intermediate data.
Another potential threat to DTFL is that an attacker can infer client model parameters by inputting dummy data into the client’s local model and training a replicating model on the resulting feature maps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. DTFL can prevent this attack by denying clients access to external datasets, query services, and dummy data, thereby preventing the attacker from obtaining the necessary data.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed DTFL as an effective solution to address the challenges of training large models collaboratively in a heterogeneous environment.
DTFL offloads different portions of the global model to clients in different tiers and allows each client to update the models in parallel using local-loss-based training, which can meet computation and communication requirements on resource-constrained devices and mitigate the straggler problem. We developed a dynamic tier scheduling algorithm, which dynamically assigns clients to appropriate tiers based on their training time. The convergence of DTFL is analyzed theoretically.
Extensive experiments on large datasets with different numbers of highly heterogeneous clients show that DTFL can significantly reduce the training time while maintaining model accuracy, compared with state-of-the-art FL methods.</p>
