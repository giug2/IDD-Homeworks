<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Training ML models which are fair across different demographic groups is of critical importance due to the increased integration of ML in crucial decision-making scenarios such as healthcare and recruitment.
Federated learning has been viewed as a promising solution for collaboratively training machine learning models among multiple parties while maintaining the privacy of their local data.
However, federated learning also poses new challenges in mitigating the potential bias against certain populations (e.g., demographic groups), as this typically requires centralized access to the sensitive information (e.g., race, gender) of each datapoint.
Motivated by the importance and challenges of group fairness in federated learning, in this work, we propose FairFed, a novel algorithm for fairness-aware aggregation to enhance group fairness in federated learning.
Our proposed approach is server-side and agnostic to the applied local debiasing thus allowing for flexible use of different local debiasing methods across clients.
We evaluate FairFed empirically versus common baselines for fair ML and federated learning, and demonstrate that it provides fairer models particularly under highly heterogeneous data distributions across clients.
We also demonstrate the benefits of FairFed in scenarios involving naturally distributed real-life data collected from different geographical locations or departments within an organization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An important notion of fairness in machine learning, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">group fairness</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, concerns the mitigation of bias in the performance of a trained model against certain protected demographic groups, which are defined based on sensitive attributes within the population (e.g., gender, race).
Several approaches to achieve group fairness have been studied in recent years in centralized settings. However, these approaches rely on the availability of the entire dataset at a central entity during training, and are therefore unsuitable for application in Federated Learning (FL).</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning allows for decentralized training of large-scale models without requiring direct access to clients’ data, hence maintaining their privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>.
However, this decentralized nature makes it complicated to translate solutions for fair training from centralized settings to FL, where the decentralization of data is a major cornerstone. This gives rise to the key question that we attempt to answer in this paper: <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How can we train a classifier using FL so as to achieve group fairness, while maintaining data decentralization?</span></p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One potential solution that one may consider for training fair models in FL is for each client to apply local debiasing on its locally trained models (without sharing any additional information or data), while the FL server simply aggregates the model parameters in each round using FL aggregation algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> (or its subsequent derivatives, e.g., FedOPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reddi et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>).
Although this allows for training a global model without explicitly sharing the local datasets,
but the drawback is that applying a debiasing mechanism at each client in isolation on its local dataset can results in poor performance in scenarios where data distributions are highly-heterogeneous across clients (See Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FairFed: Enabling Group Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another potential solution for fair training in FL would be to adapt a debiasing technique from the rich literature of centralized fair training to be used in FL. Although, this may result in reasonable fair training (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FairFed: Enabling Group Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), but in the process of applying this debiasing globally, the clients may need to exchange additional detailed information with the server about their dataset constitution which can leak information about different subgroups in the client’s dataset. For example, the server may require knowledge of the model’s performance on each group in a client’s dataset and/or local statistical information about each group in the dataset.</p>

The weights are a function of the mismatch between the global fairness measurement (on the full dataset) and the local fairness measurement at each client, favoring clients whose local measures match the global fairness measure. We carefully design the exchange between the server and clients during weights computation, making use of the secure aggregation protocol (SecAgg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to prevent the server from learning any explicit information about any single client’s dataset.

<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">New challenges in FL have introduced different notions of fairness.

In this paper, we instead focus on the notion of <span id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">group fairness</span> in FL, where each datapoint in the FL system belongs to particular group, and we aim to train models that do not discriminate against any group of datapoints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several recent works have made progress on group fairness in FL. One common research direction is to distributively solve an optimization objective with fairness constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang, Kou, and Wang <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Du et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Gálvez et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which requires each client to share the statistics of the sensitive attributes of its local dataset to the server. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abay et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> investigated the effectiveness of adopting a global reweighting mechanism. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zeng, Chen, and Lee <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, an adaptation of the FairBatch debiasing algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Roh et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is proposed for FL where clients use FairBatch locally and the weights are updated through the server in each round.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Papadaki et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, an algorithm is proposed to achieve minimax fairness in federated learning.
In these works, the server requires each client to explicitly share the performance of the model on each subgroup separately; for example (males with +ve outcomes, females with +ve outcomes, etc).
Differently from these works, our proposed FairFed method does not restrict the local debiasing strategy of the participating clients, thus increasing the flexibility of the system. Furthermore, FairFed does not share explicit information on the model performance for any specific group within a client’s dataset. Finally, our empirical evaluations consider extreme cases of data heterogeneity and demonstrate that our method can yield significant fairness improvements in these situations.</p>

In our experiments, we treat each state as one participant in the FL system (i.e., 51 participants). Due to the demographic distribution of different states, clients share different data sizes and sensitive attributes distribution. For example, Wyoming has the smallest dataset size with 3,064 users compared to California that has 195,665 users. We choose the race information (white/non-white) of the users as the sensitive attribute of interest in our experiments. Hawaii is the state with the lowest ratio (26%) of white population. , while Vermont has the highest ratio (96%) of its dataset as white population.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, motivated by the importance and challenges of group fairness in federated learning, we propose the FairFed algorithm to enhance group fairness via a fairness-aware aggregation method, aiming to provide fair model performance across different sensitive groups (e.g., racial, gender groups) while maintaining high utility. Though our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art fair federated learning frameworks under high data heterogeneity, limitations still exist. As such, we plan to further improve FairFed from these perspectives: 1) We report the empirical results on binary classification tasks in this work. We will extend the work to various application scenarios (e.g., regression tasks, NLP tasks); 2) We will extend our study to scenarios of heterogeneous application of different local debiasing methods and understand how the framework can be tuned to incorporate updates from these different debiasing schemes; 3) We currently focus on group fairness in FL, but we plan to integrate FairFed with other fairness notions in FL, such as <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">collaborative fairness</span> and <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-based fairness</span>.
We give an example of how FairFed can incorporate both group-fairness and client-based fairness in Appendix <a href="#A4" title="Appendix D FairFed with Uniform Accuracy constraints ‣ FairFed: Enabling Group Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D</span></a>, which sets promising preliminary steps for future exploration.</p>

<p id="A3.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the notable advantages of FairFed is that each client can have the freedom of adopting different local debiasing strategies. For instance, a fraction of clients might not adopt any local debiasing strategy due to inavailability of the full local dataset at any instance (online stream of datapoints). In this section, we highlight the performance of FairFed under such realistic application scenario.</p>

<div id="A4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond optimizing group fairness metrics, the notion of client-based fairness is critically important in trustworthy FL systems, since FL clients would be more reluctant to collaborate if they end up with models that perform badly on their local data distributions.
To pursue the goal of client-based fairness in parallel to group fairness, our proposed FairFed algorithm can also be revised to incentivize uniform accuracy across clients. <span id="A4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Uniform accuracy</span> aims to minimize the performance differences across client. To quantify this criteria, we calculate the standard deviation of the accuracy (Std-Acc.) of each client as the metric of <span id="A4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">uniform accuracy</span>, where smaller values indicates better uniformity.
The revised procedure (i.e., revised version of (<a href="#S4.Ex2" title="4.2 Computing aggregation weights for FairFed ‣ 4 FairFed: Fairness-aware aggregation in FL ‣ FairFed: Enabling Group Fairness in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>)) computes the aggregation weights as follows for <math id="A4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\forall k\in[K]" display="inline"><semantics id="A4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml">∀</mo><mi id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml">k</mi></mrow><mo id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">∈</mo><mrow id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.1.1.cmml">[</mo><mi id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.1.1.cmml">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2"><in id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.1"></in><apply id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1">for-all</csymbol><ci id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2">𝑘</ci></apply><apply id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.1.1.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1">delimited-[]</csymbol><ci id="A4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A4.p1.1.m1.1c">\forall k\in[K]</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>
