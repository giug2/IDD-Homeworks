<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of new models and ways to process users’ data. The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users’ privacy is of utmost importance. Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach called TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost. The TPFL results were compared with 6 other baseline methods; namely FedAvg, FedProx, FLIS DC, FLIS HC, IFCA and FedTM. The results demonstrated that TPFL performance better than baseline methods with 98.94% accuracy on MNIST, 98.52% accuracy on FashionMNIST and 91.16% accuracy on FEMNIST dataset.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Today’s world is heavily driven by numerous Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and it is almost impossible to ignore its pervasive existence in our digital lives. This widespread adoption of ML applications equals huge amounts of never-before-seen data from various types of sources, whether it is a face detection camera or a recommendation based on a query in a search engine w1. This phenomenon in itself raises critical concerns in regards to user privacy as well as data security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Traditional ML techniques rely on centralized approaches, where users data is displaced and moved to where the algorithm resides <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The technique suffers from numerous disadvantages, including arduous maintenance of large amounts of data which is produced in mass from various parties, communication cost of data transfer from parties to the centralized server, and finally the most important one, serious privacy risks againsts users data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the recent promising solutions for tackling such hurdles is Federated Learning (FL). This new paradigm has enabled many to collaboratively train models on decentralized devices while safeguarding users privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This novel technique prevents users’ data from being displaced and instead moves the algorithm where data resides <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. FL paves the way for the creation of on-device models that are trained on local data. As a result, instead of sharing the users’ data, models’ parameters are shared with a centralized aggregator where models are combined to create a single, high-performance global model. This new strategy enables each local model to achieve accurate results by focusing its learning process on user-specific data distribution. In other words, the local model is tailored to local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In this way, maintenance of the users data in a centralized server is eliminated and privacy risks no longer pose a serious threat. However, this paradigm has not been perfect in recent years. One of the major disadvantages of FL algorithms is struggling to reach a high degree of accuracy in the aggregator. This struggle in the aggregator becomes evident when the data is non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Non-IID data is undoubtedly an important challenge in the FL settings, which usually ends up to be the global model’s biggest reason for low accuracy in comparison to local models. This phenomenon stems from heterogeneous data distribution among participating clients. Combining models in the aggregator in the face of data heterogeneity is the main problem that prevents global model from achieving high-performance results. For this reason, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has been a fruitful strategy to tackle this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. PFL takes data heterogeneity into consideration and eliminates the one-size-fits-all assumption so that the aggregation of the personalized model of each participant can result in a global model that reflects the data distribution of each device. In other words, a model that works well on one’s device will most probably have unacceptable performance on another client’s device since their data distribution is completely different from one another. Therefore, if all models are simply aggregated without any considerations, accuracy is significantly reduced in the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One of PFL strategies to keep the personalized preferences of clients intact during the aggregation is multi-center FL, in which similar clients are partitioned into clusters. Thus, unlike single-center FL where there is only one single global model for all the clients, with multi-center FL we can take personalization into account and group similar clients into their corresponding cluster. This multi-center partitioning establishes numerous clusters, each responsible for weight aggregation of its corresponding clients. One of the best ML algorithms that can be used in FL settings is the Tsetlin Machine (TM). The TM algorithm is a great choice compared to Deep Learning (DL) when it comes to interpretability and explainability. This phenomenon stems from the fact that the TM relies on a voting mechanism that enables the TM models to be more transparent in comparison with DL models that possess a black-box nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we present a novel multi-center FL method that, to the best of our knowledge, leverages the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm for the first time in the context of PFL, which we call Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning (TPFL). This innovative approach is designed to perform effectively with both IID and non-IID data in a few-shot learning fashion. In essence, the clustering mechanism of TPFL is directly based on each client’s confidence towards a specific class of data. In fact, clients generally in an FL setting tend to be trained on data that they generate locally. Therefore, a client that is trained on images of odd numbers tends to have more confidence towards those classes of data. And similarly a client with images of even numbers is confident about what it had been trained on; a range of even numbers. As a result, the more data the local model is trained on, the more confident it becomes towards that particular class. Our novelty specially holds true when FL clients data distribution is non-IID. In other words, when some random clients are only trained on data whose distribution is heavily skewed towards a similar class of data, they must be confident and consequently partitioned into the same cluster.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the advent of FL-based architecture, different approaches have opted for PFL to increase the efficiency and accuracy of FL models. Ghosh et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduce a one-shot clustering algorithm called Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA) to address the challenges in FL clustering using Empirical Risk Minimizers (ERM) from FL clients. They also discuss practical aspects of implementing IFCA, including a weight-sharing scheme that reduces communication costs between the aggregator and FL clients. The IFCA uses FEMNIST and MNIST for its work, which yields satisfactory accuracy in all experimental setups. Work of Briggs et al. introduces a novel method for training specialized ML models over distributed datasets enhanced by hierarchical clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Their paper continues to add a clustering step within the federated learning protocol, which was clustering clients based on the similarity of their model weight updates. Another positive aspect of this work was comprehensive analysis of how hierarchical clustering impacts test set accuracy across different IID and non-IID data settings. Another valuable work for clustering-based PFL was the work of Ruan and Joe-Wong in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which proposed FedSoft. Their contribution was based on proximal local updates. Unlike traditional hard clustering, where each client belongs to a single cluster, FedSoft allows clients to be associated with multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. A proximal term is added to the local objective function of each client, ensuring the local models stay close to the global model, which as a result helps in mitigating the divergence issues often encountered in federated learning due to heterogeneous data distributions across clients.
<br class="ltx_break">The work of Long et al. brings forward an approach called Federated Stochastic Expectation Maximization (FeSEM) that solves the challenge of non-IID data using a framework with multi-center clusters for clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. This approach partitions clients based on their data similarity using K-Means algorithm that is guided by the FeSEM algorithm. Effectively, each user is aligned with its corresponding global model and as a result, the loss is minimized in each cluster. The authors used Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST), FedCelebA datasets for their work and case study comparison to illustrate the effectiveness of their results. The authors however, did not show the communication cost of their model since one of the important criteria within FL settings is the communication cost between the clients and the aggregator, whether the FL setting is based on a single-center or a multi-center architecture. Work of Mansour et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed three distinct approaches to achieve better personalization in FL settings which are user clustering, data interpolation and model interpolation, respectively. Although the approaches are not combined, their comparison sheds a light on different aspects of personalization. The clustering scheme allows the FL architecture to be more scalable than the predecessor approaches. Their benchmark datasets were EMNIST-62 as well as synthetic data that was used for the initial evaluation and understanding of the algorithms’ behavior. Sattler et al. proposed a novel model-agnostic clustering algorithm for clients whose distributions are similar when it comes to non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Their unique approach is the adaptiveness of their framework, which adjusts the clusters as more data becomes available. They used MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) datasets for their framework. Gong et al. proposed another framework for clustering clients based on non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Their novel strategies include a local training adjustment strategy as well as an adaptive weighted strategy for client clustering based on voting. Model accuracy was improved and communication overhead was reduced by evaluating the model on MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. 
<br class="ltx_break">Morafah et al. have proposed yet another federated framework for non-IID data called Federated Learning by Inference Similarity (FLIS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Their clustering approach is based on inference similarity. Their approach does not force the number of clusters to be known prior to the cluster creation process. Their model-agnostic approach minimizes the need for frequent communication between clients and the central server. Their work focuses on MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10. Cho et al. have proposed a framework called COMET that takes the local models’ data as well as their architecture into consideration, which is likely to be a scenario for industrial FL architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Moreover, their approach relied on knowledge distillation mechanism that allows clients to share only the logits (predictions) on a common unlabeled dataset. In addition to reduced communication overhead, their algorithm’s improved accuracy outperforms some of the contenders in FL settings. Their work was trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
Work of Fraboni et al. aims to enhance client representativity and reduce the variance in the stochastic aggregation weights of clients. This framework is based on 1) sample size-based clustering, which groups clients based on the size of their datasets and 2) model similarity-based clustering, which groups clients based on the similarity of their model updates. The framework is trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Work of Camara et al. proposes a clustered FL architecture specifically designed for unsupervised anomaly detection in large, heterogeneous networks of IoT devices. This approach addresses the challenges of data isolation, network overhead, and privacy concerns. Their results demonstrate the improvements in anomaly detection performance in addition to reduction of network overhead and improved global model convergence. Their work was evaluated on a benign IoT network traffic testbed called Gotham <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Work of Yin et al. introduced an efficient one-off clustered federated learning framework called FedEOC, which aims to improve the balance between accuracy and efficiency in federated learning by clustering clients only once and applying the clusters over multiple rounds. FedEOC leverages the learning-to-learn characteristic of meta-learning in order to quickly adapt to new tasks, ensuring that the initial model parameters are well-suited for all clients. The FedEOC framework was evaluated on the ml-100K and ml-1M dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Li et al. put forward a new algorithm called Federated Learning with Soft Clustering (FLSC). This algorithm combines the strengths of soft clustering and the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA). Contrary to IFCA, which uses non overlapping clusters, FLSC allows for overlapping clusters. This means that each client can contribute to multiple clusters, improving the utilization of local information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Their work used MNIST and FMNIST datasets. He et al. proposed a framework that brings forward a novel layer-wise perturbation function that reduces the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) noise in comparison to relevant methods. As a result, communication overhead was decreased in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. MNIST, fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) and Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) were used for the evaluation of their framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Finally, the work of Ghosh et al. addresses the challenges of robustness in a heterogeneous environment with Byzantine nodes. Their proposed method consists of a three-stage modular algorithm; 1) Worker nodes compute their Local Empirical Risk minimizers (ERMs) and send them to the center node, 2) The center node clusters these local ERMs to form distinct clusters and 3) Each cluster undergoes a Byzantine-tolerant distributed optimization process to refine the model parameters. Results with 3 different clustering strategies were presented, namely K-means (KM), Trimmed K-means (TKM), and K-geomedians (KGM). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard non-robust algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The real-world dataset that was used was Yahoo! Learning to Rank Dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

Not only the TM itself, but also its variants provide such an interpretable architecture. Recently, numerous other advancements have been proposed, such as the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM) that is specifically designed for image recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and Regression Tsetlin Machine (RTM) that addresses continuous prediction problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. This versatility illustrates the potential that the TM algorithm holds for edge and IoT devices within an FL setting. This becomes more interesting when computational resources are not abundant, paving the way for a more efficient and scalable approach to AI development. This is due to the fact that the TM’s advantage compared to the DL models is its hardware-friendliness. As a result, the TM can be considered a prime candidate as a computationally-efficient algorithm.</p>

Reward feedback reinforces the action, while penalty feedback weakens it. Therefore, the TM completely differs from continuous-valued parameters and gradient-based optimization methods such as DL methods. However, similar to DL models, the TM algorithm is composed of multiple layers in order to learn from data.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main challenges in the FL settings is the heterogeneity of data among clients. We aim to enhance the accuracy of clients by introducing a novelty that allows clients to avoid sharing their knowledge if they had insufficient training data on that class. This avoidance allows client’s weights to be aggregated only if they are confident about what they have learned. Therefore, clients in TPFL are grouped into clusters based on their confidence scores towards a specific class of the data.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The communication costs among different clustering techniques are fundamentally different, specifically DL-based techniques compared with TPFL that relies on the TM algorithm. In case of high-class datasets, such as CIFAR100 or FEMNIST, TPFL has a key advantage in upload communication efficiency. This phenomenon stems from the fact that DL-based techniques necessitate the transmission of a full weight vector for the entire model, while in TPFL only the weight vector corresponding to the class with the highest confidence score is uploaded from each client device. In case of download communication cost, TPFL is still more efficient than other existing methods. However, assuming a federation of 100 clients whose data partitioning is based on CIFA100 dataset, the worst case scenario for the TPFL is that the download cost would be equal to the upload cost as no client in the federation shares a similar class to aggregate their weights. Therefore, no aggregation would take place and only weights are shared with the aggregator.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess TPFL’s performance under different data distribution scenarios, we conducted experiments with varying levels of IID and non-IID partitioning. Experiment 1 used fully IID partitioning, while experiments 2 to 5 progressively increased non-IID partitioning: 75% IID and 25% non-IID in experiment 2, 50% IID and 50% non-IID in experiment 3, and so on.

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For training and evaluating the TPFL, we used three benchmarking datasets; MNIST, Fashion MNIST and Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) datasets. However, it must be noted that in reality we used EMNIST instead of directly working with FEMNIST dataset. This is because, firstly, MNIST and Fashion MNIST were not available in frameworks that provide direct access to FEMNIST. Therefore, we created an independent function in the TPFL framework in order to create either IID or non-IID data based on class out of any dataset the user desires. Thus, enabling the user to just download any dataset they wish in order to create IID or non-IID dataset for clients in the federation (e.g. CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are possible to be downloaded). Secondly, such frameworks are not constantly updated by maintainers so that it can be compatible with the latest version of Tensorflow (e.g. the LEAF framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> still requires Tensorflow 1). From here on in this paper, FEMNIST dataset is the partitioned data resulted from EMNIST.

This evident pattern clearly proves the relationship between the data distribution of all clients and their confidence. In other words, the more skewed the data distribution, the more confident the model towards that class, and the more confident the model, the faster their convergence time. Hence, the convergence time for our confidence-based clustering method is far less when the clients’ partitioning scheme is severely non-IID. On the other hand, the models tend to be less confident when data distribution is uniformly IID, which is a clear indication that the entire federation requires much more time in order to become more confident and reach high-accuracy results. For such circumstances, increasing the local clients’ training epochs or even increasing the total round number of federation can be beneficial so that high-accuracy results can be achieved.
Figure <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6.7 TPFL Results ‣ 6 Experimental Results ‣ TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence-Based Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the communication cost of all three datasets under 5 different experimental setups for a total of 10 rounds. The download cost is far lower than the upload cost, however, the more classes the dataset has, the more probable it is for the download cost to be more. Therefore, it can be seen for the FEMNIST dataset under experiment 5 that the download cost progressively becomes closer to the upload cost</p>

<div id="S6.SS8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Clients in the FL settings are normally evaluated under non-IID data partitioning schemes. Therefore, We compared the baseline methods with the proposed TPFL method under non-IID data partitioning. Hence, our comparison is between the best results of each baseline with non-IID data partitioning and TPFL under experiment 5. Table <a href="#S6.SS7" title="6.7 TPFL Results ‣ 6 Experimental Results ‣ TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence-Based Clustering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.7</span></a> shows the summary of our comparison. As it can be seen, the TPFL model outperforms all baselines in all datasets followed by IFCA and then FedTM. It is worth mentioning that TFPL implementation was carried out only in 10 rounds, the least number of rounds among all baseline methods. This phenomenon illustrates the positive effect of cluster-based personalization within TPFL setting. In addition, the communication cost of the TPFL in terms of uploaded and downloaded model parameters is the most optimized followed by FedTM, which itself is based on the TM algorithm. 
<br class="ltx_break">This evident result shows the difference between DL-based models and the TM-based models. Based on the obtained results and their comparison with baseline models, it can be understood that the TPFL approach can be utilized in a one-shot learning fashion, in which each experimental setup is carried out only in one round. However, it is advisable to increase the number of local training epochs in order to make up for absence of multiple rounds of training.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advent of FL algorithms, numerous works have been put forward to maintain the users privacy. However, vanilla FL suffers from numerous disadvantages. PFL is considered a promising solution to solve the shortcomings of the vanilla FL. In this work, we propose a personalization method called Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning (TPFL) that leverages the voting mechanism of the TM in order to cluster clients based on their confidence towards a class. The results of TPFL compared with other FL and PFL baselines demonstrate that TPFL outperforms all baselines for MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST datasets. A promising future work that can be built upon TPFL is the utilization of innovative clustering strategies such as thresholding strategies for defining a confidence threshold and multiclass selection of class weights | sharing weights of more than one class | so that a client can be assigned to multiple clusters.</p>
