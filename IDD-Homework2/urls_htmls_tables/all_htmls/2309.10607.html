<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">While Federated learning (FL) is attractive for pulling privacy-preserving distributed training data, the credibility of participating clients and non-inspectable data pose new security threats, of which poisoning attacks are particularly rampant and hard to defend without compromising privacy, performance or other desirable properties of FL. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-purified FL (SPFL) method that enables benign clients to exploit trusted historical features of locally purified model to supervise the training of aggregated model in each iteration. The purification is performed by an attention-guided self-knowledge distillation where the teacher and student models are optimized locally for task loss, distillation loss and attention-based loss simultaneously. SPFL imposes no restriction on the communication protocol and aggregator at the server. It can work in tandem with any existing secure aggregation algorithms and protocols for augmented security and privacy guarantee. We experimentally demonstrate that SPFL outperforms state-of-the-art FL defenses against various poisoning attacks. The attack success rate of SPFL trained model is at most 3<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> above that of a clean model, even if the poisoning attack is launched in every iteration with all but one malicious clients in the system. Meantime, it improves the model quality on normal inputs compared to FedAvg, either under attack or in the absence of an attack.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm for multiple participants (also known as clients) to collaboratively train a model using their own data. The workflow is typically orchestrated by a central server which collects only updates to locally trained model but not the raw training data that is stored locally and never exchanged or transferred. These updates are aggregated by the server to improve the global model performance and the updated model data is passed to the participating clients in exchange for new updates in the next iteration of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The aggregation is usually computed in a secure manner such that each client, including the server, can learn nothing more than the aggregation result to avoid indirect privacy leakage of sensitive information for inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond attacks targeting data inference, FL also opens the door to a fleet of malicious alterations of the training pipeline made feasible by distributed learning over uninspectable private datasets and privacy-preserving multi-party computation involving potentially unreliable devices. New attack surfaces may be introduced into FL system by using training pipeline as an intermediary for inference time attacks. Since individual benign clients and the server have no control over other clients’ behaviors, a malicious client may deviate from the prescribed training protocol to modify the model in an undesirable way to achieve different objectives. The attacks can be conducted via inflated model updates by either crafting poisoned data for local model training (data poisoning) or directly manipulating model updates to the server (model poisoning) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The attack scope can be untargeted or targeted. Untargeted attacks downgrade the model performance globally, whereas targeted poisoning attacks affect the model’s output on only a small subset of data points with specified characteristics while preserving its overall accuracy. This type of integrity threat has gained more attention recently due to the fact that it is harder to detect, and can be easily executed – a single-shot attack may suffice to create a backdoor into the centrally learned model. Some nuanced attacks may exhibit a continuum between these two outcomes. Byzantine threat model assumes that one or more adversaries can directly control certain number of clients to alter their outputs and bias the learned model to produce arbitrary outputs towards the adversarial objective. Unlike centralized learning, adversaries in FL setting have access to a pool of Byzantine devices and can inspect the model parameters to coordinate their poisoned updates in real time (within-update collusion) or adapt their attack across updates (cross-update collusion) as the training progresses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is challenging to guarantee the security of FL against poisoning attacks. For one thing, the training data cannot be inspected by anyone due to data minimization. This makes existing defenses against backdoor attacks that require full control of training process, or access to training data or holdout set inapplicable in the FL setting. For another thing, if defense strategies have to access or compute on plain local gradients in defending against poisoning attacks, then local gradients are inevitably leaked, which is not permitted for privacy concern. Furthermore, adversaries are allowed to collude and control more clients at different time, which dramatically increases the effectiveness and stealth of poisoning attacks. Cross-update collusion makes both targeted and untargeted attacks more difficult to be detected and defended against as each Byzantine client is free to participate in or exit from any round of update. Moreover, defenses against model update and data poisoning attacks must assume white box adversaries in FL setting, which adds challenges to preserve privacy, robustness and model’s performance simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Existing defense methods based on robust aggregation rules try to replace averaging with robust estimators such as geometric median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, coordinate-wise median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math>-trimmed mean, or a variant/combination of such techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Although some of these robust aggregation algorithms are provably effective against data and untargeted model poisoning attacks under certain assumptions, their theoretical guarantees are often not met on more rigorous empirical evaluation with different learning problems. most of these Byzantine-tolerant aggregation schemes and other server-side mitigation approaches generally assume that the server is honest. They operate on visible model updates, which are not compatible or cannot be easily integrated with multi-party computation protocols that possess strong user privacy guarantee. A recent defense based on black-box knowledge transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> reduces information leakage by reducing the dimension of the exchanged information. It shares predictions instead of model parameters of individual client models on public data. The assumption of a large common pool of training data itself violates the central telnet of distributed learning. Using public training data to share confidence scores also exposes the local model to membership inference attack. Without a centralized model, it becomes harder to pre-empt the hyperparameters for differential privacy protection without sacrificing the accuracy of benign client models.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It is daunting if not impractically costly to design a foolproof FL system with ideal privacy and security properties. To prevent perfect from being the enemy of good, it is more important to address security and privacy problems of FL by a divide-and-conquer approach with modular protection methods. Each mitigation method can coexist with other countermeasures to mitigate different threats and can be improved independently without hurting the security and privacy guarantees of others to minimize trade off requirement on multiple desirable properties. With this in mind, we propose a novel self-purified FL (SPFL) method by using self-distillation to defend against poisoning attacks with high Byzantine tolerance. SPFL can be performed by each benign client independently and co-exist with any secure and privacy-preserving aggregation methods. The local model of last iteration plays the teacher role, and purifies the aggregated malicious model via knowledge distillation in each iteration of FL training. An effective mechanism is proposed to transfer class-discriminating attention information between the teacher and the student. Specifically, our major contributions are:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm for building a model based on training data of multiple decentralized participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Instead of pooling raw training data, the global model is established by collecting focused model updates from clients who trained the shared model locally using their own data for privacy preservation. Focused updates are narrowly scoped to contain minimum information for specific learning task, and they can be instantiated as model parameters, gradients or the gaps before and after model training in wide-ranging algorithms. In horizontal FL, different clients have different data but the local training datasets share the same feature and label space. Usually, the training process is orchestrated by a central server. One of the typical optimization algorithms for updating the global model is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For each communication round (iteration), each client applies stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to train the model with its local data for a number of internal epochs. The clients then transmit their local model parameters to the central server, where the global model is updated with the aggregation of the clients’ local model updates. This process is repeated until the loss function converges. As the shared model parameters carry extensive information about the corresponding training data of the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, secure aggregation protocols are integrated into FedAvg to prevent indirect leakage of personal information. Secure aggregation enables multiple clients to jointly aggregate the model updates but no party can learn anything beyond the aggregation results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. To avoid shared model parameters from being stealthily extracted and exploited for inference attacks, individual local model updates are protected by privacy-preserving and cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or mask hiding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> before they are uploaded to the server for aggregation.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Poisoning attack is one of the most notorious threats of FL. It corrupts a target model at the training process to impede the model from converging to the optimal performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or control its prediction results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The distributed training attributes and privacy-preserving aggregation of FL infrastructure bolster such attacks. Since the model is trained locally before the updated local model parameters are submitted and aggregated by the server, any participant who has access to the local model can deviate from the prescribed protocol to conduct a training-time attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, due to the confidentiality requirements, all participants are not supposed to know how other clients generate their updates. The coordination server is constrained by the opacity of the updates and training process at the local premises to verify the received data integrity. This gives a group of malicious participants the opportunity to directly and cooperatively manipulate the training processes or trained parameters of their local models to stealthily insert a backdoor into the global model. This way of feeding the aggregator with rigged updates from one or more local backdoored models is known as model poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. It is more powerful than data poisoning attacks in centralized learning. Depending on the adversary’s capability and goal, model poisoning can also be combined with data poisoning and executed simultaneously or individually in FL.
<br class="ltx_break">  
According to the goals, poisoning attacks can be broadly divided into untargeted and targeted. Untargeted attacks compromise the trained model to cause misclassification of clean inputs. They tend to incur non-trivial degradation in learning performance or obstruct learning convergence. The attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> assumed that the local model parameters on compromised client devices can be manipulated during the learning process to produce a large testing error rate on the global model. However, benign participants can observe the apparent adverse global effect during the training process and take actions to mitigate this type of attack. In contrast, targeted attacks embed malicious functionality into the trained model by controlling the model’s prediction accuracy only under specific circumstances without disrupting its normal behavior. This type of attack maintains the model availability by achieving high accuracy on both its main task and the attacker chosen subtask. Backdoor attack is the most widely encountered targeted attack in FL, wherein a backdoor is surreptitiously infiltrated into the joint model to change the model’s outputs only on inputs with certain characteristics selected by the attacker. 
<br class="ltx_break">  
Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> developed a model poisoning attack (MPA) that allows any participants in FL to replace the joint model with a backdoored model. It was found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that the backdoored model can be trained by limiting the update norms to avoid norm clipping and evade anomaly detection. Byzantine participants can share the updates evenly and maliciously train the model with multiple rounds of norm-bounded projected gradient descents to strengthen the backdoor effect. Unlike centralized backdoor attacks on FL where each adversarial participant embeds the same global trigger during training, distributed backdoor attack (DBA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> decomposes a global trigger pattern into disjoint local patterns and embeds each of them into the training set of a different adversarial participant. Baruch et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> showed that directed small changes to many parameters of a few Byzantine participants is sufficient to circumventing defenses for FL. Their A Little Is Enough (LIE) attack searches for the perturbation range in which the parameters can be changed without being detected even in the i.i.d. settings. By operating within the population variance, non-omniscient attack with access to only data of the rogue participants is feasible. Bhagoji et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> showed that a highly constrained adversary can still succeed in model poisoning by an alternating minimization strategy with distance constraints to avoid the statistical anomaly detection on updated values. This attack is more stealthy than model replacement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as it boosts only the malicious component of the update.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the existing defenses are performed by the trusted federated server. The most widely studied approach is the statistics-based defense leveraging specific aggregation rules to remove or mitigate the outliers. Averaging the received gradients is optimal in the absence of Byzantine clients but brittle even if only one malicious cient is present. Non-linear aggregation rules like median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, trimmed-mean, geometric-mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, krum and bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> have been proposed to replace the arithmetic mean in the original FedAvg by computing a reliable vector or choosing one of the values that represents the centre of the benign distribution. FLTrust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> utilizes the root dataset, which is a small clean dataset collected manually by the server, to bootstrap trust on the server. FLTrust normalizes local model updates to the same hyper-sphere as the server model to diminish the effect of adversarial updates. To strengthen good updates against Byzantine attacks, an adaptive federated averaging (AFA) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> was proposed. It uses Hidden Markov model to model the ability of each client and cosine similarity to measure the quality of model updates during training. The above defenses deter availability attacks from faulty, noisy and outlier behaviors and block bad clients based on measurable distance between benign and Byzantine model parameters, which may not be effective in detecting backdoor updates. Robust Learning Rate (RLR) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> controls the clients’ participation in each dimension of the model updates by adjusting the server’s learning rate according to the sign information of the client’s model updates. The idea is to move the aggregated model parameters in the direction towards maximizing the adversarial loss. Foolsgold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> also makes use of the similarity between malicious clients’ gradients to counteract sybil-based label flipping and backdoor poisoning with boundless number of attackers. Instead of identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts, ShieldFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> measures the cosine similarity over encrypted model update using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption to resist poisoned model without compromising privacy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These defenses deter the poisoning attacks to some extent but they are not without caveats. Most methods fail to prevent the aggregation from being polluted when aggressive adversaries have control of a large proportion of clients, or the malicious updates are made as close to other updates as possible to bypass the detection. Clipping based methods are ineffective against poisoned model updates with small magnitudes but high attack impact. Additionally, clipping and detection-based methods can only be operated on plaintext model updates. Many of the robust aggregation rules do not work with privacy-preserving aggregation, which weakens the privacy assurance of FL. Privacy-preserving aggregations like RFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and ShieldFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> involving complex cryptographic operations are highly computationally intensive. Similar to other robust aggregation rules, they often reject not only poisoned model updates but also flatten out benign model updates, which cause performance degradation of the federated model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Defenses performed at the client’s side are more reliable as it provides guarantee for each client individually without assuming the trustworthiness of the server and other clients. Nevertheless, very few methods tackle poisoning attacks from the client perspective. White Blood Cell for FL (FL-WBC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> is a client-based defense that mitigates model poisoning effect of polluted global model by perturbing the parameter space during local training where long-lasting attack effect on parameters is identified. Inspired by matching networks, where the class of an input is predicted from the similarity of its features with a support set of labeled examples, Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed a new defense mechanism to reduce the impact of backdoor attacks by removing the decision logic from the shared model. Adversarial training can also be leveraged to enhance robustness of FL. Federated adversarial training (FAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> enables a learning model to pivot on the sensitive attributes by modifying the optimization objectives and loss functions to achieve predictions that are independent of the sensitive attributes embedded in the training data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the error bound and poisoning susceptibility due to the high dimensionality of model parameter updates, Cronus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> abandons the shared model completely by sharing only the logits of locally trained models on public dataset. As adversaries can eavesdrop the transmitted confidence scores corresponding to the public data, black-box access itself is inadequate to avert model extraction and inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Both membership privacy mechanism for training the local model and prediction privacy mechanism for protecting the updates are necessary but they inevitably trade utility for privacy. This atypical FL setting raises further question on the assessment of performance gain - the contribution due to data from other clients over and above the public dataset is inconsistent among clients. Without a common model architecture, objective inconsistency is exacerbated by the increase in diversity of updates across heterogeneous models unknown to the aggregator. This new FL paradigm introduces more biases and poses a significant challenge to utility-privacy trade-off optimization.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">KD was first developed to compress a bigger model or an ensemble of well-trained machine learning models into a smaller model without significant quality drop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. It is also referred to as a teacher-student paradigm for knowledge transfer between a knowledgeable model (teacher) and a learning model (student). The original idea is to let the compact student model mimic the teacher model to achieve comparable or even superior performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Lately, KD has also demonstrated potential benefits in enhancing training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, adversarial robustness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. According to whether the teacher model is updated simultaneously with the student model, the learning mechanisms of KD can be categorized into three main groups: offline distillation, online distillation, and self-distillation. Most of the previous KD methods work offline, where the teacher model is pre-trained, and only the smaller student model is updated with the guidance of the well-trained teacher model during distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Online distillation is proposed to eliminate the need
for a large-capacity high-performance teacher model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Both the teacher and student models are updated
simultaneously, and the whole KD framework is end-to-end trainable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Specifically, mutual learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and co-distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> train multiple neural networks that work with the same architecture in a collaborative way, where any one network can be the student
model and is trained by transferring the knowledge from the
other teacher models. In self-distillation, the same network acts as teacher and student. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> first proposed to distill knowledge within the network itself by transferring knowledge from deeper sections of the network into shallow sections. Similarly, self-attention distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> utilizes the attention maps of higher layers as distillation targets for its lower layers. Snapshot distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> is
a special variant of self-distillation, in which the supervision from the prior iterations of the network is taken to guide the training of its later iterations. This method requires the difference between teacher and student to be sufficiently large to prevent under-fitting.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Offline KD has been utilized to remove the backdoor of the trained model guided by the finetuned teacher model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. In FL, the defense against backdoor attacks takes place during the training process. The threat model and information available to the defender are completely different from those mentioned above for centralized learning.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above threat model, an active defense for robust FL scheme should possess the following desirable properties:
(1) Integrity security: the scheme should be able to mitigate the influence of poisoning attacks from a large number of malicious clients. The final deployed model should perform normally on the adversary-chosen inputs.
(2) Model quality: a strong security guarantee should not be achieved at the cost of model quality. The main task performance of the resulting model must be comparable to that without the defense.
(3) No violation of the privacy principle: the method should work with the secure aggregation mechanism of FL. It should not leak or mandate sharing of individual model updates in plaintext.
(4) No extra assumption: the defense should be implementable without requiring additional assumptions like the existence of a trusted server or public clean dataset that may not be viable in real-world scenarios.</p>

Our proposed SPFL relies on self-distillation to purify malicious model received by each client. It enables benign clients to take advantage of the historical information of trusted local models to supervise their training process by knowledge transfer. The local teacher and student models are optimized simultaneously during training. At the inference phase, the information of both models are combined to make the final prediction.</p>

Both are updated in reciprocity to enhance the integrity and performance of the trained model. Then, the updated teacher model is used for teaching in the next iteration, and the parameters of updated student model are uploaded to the server for aggregation. This process is repeated until the model converges, or the preset number of training iterations has been reached. Through this process, the student model learns not only from local data during the LOCALKD training, but also from data of other clients during the aggregation. If the global model is corrupted by updates from malicious clients through aggregation, the local teacher model helps to correct the malicious behavior via distillation.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The local training algorithm needs to fulfil two objectives. First, the teacher model is optimized for main task accuracy. To facilitate learning from the local training data and knowledge distillation from the student model, we divide the loss function into task loss, which is used to provide direct task-specific supervision, and distillation loss, which is used to transfer knowledge from the logit output. Second, the student model must be able to mitigate the backdoor effect by knowledge transfer from the teacher model besides improving its main task performance. From the explainability study of backdoor attacks, differences in the saliency maps of intermediate layers between the backdoored and clean models provide useful clues to backdoor trigger localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. To suppress the backdoor triggers if presence, a third loss function that minimizes the aggregated difference between the post-hoc attention maps of the student and teacher models is added to train the student model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.5" class="ltx_p">During the distillation process, the incorrect predictions from the teacher or student model may mislead each other in the knowledge transfer. It is important to adapt the distillation effort to the quality of trained model by changing the weight of distillation loss progressively along the training process. The model generally does not have enough knowledge about data at the early training stage, and its generalization capability improves gradually as the training progresses. So the adaptation can be simplified by increasing the values of <math id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta_{KD}^{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">β</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">K</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">D</mi></mrow><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝛽</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">𝐾</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝐷</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.m1.1c">\beta_{KD}^{t}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta_{AT}^{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">β</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">T</mi></mrow><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝛽</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.2.3.3">𝑇</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.2.m2.1c">\beta_{AT}^{t}</annotation></semantics></math> gradually with the training iteration <math id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.3.m3.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.13" class="ltx_p">An attack succeeds if the trained model can misclassify the triggered examples to the target label. To increase the attack success rate, during the attacker’s training, we add a special pixel pattern to 20 images in a batch of 64 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and change their labels to 0 for MNIST and bird for CIFAR10. Especially for DBA, the global trigger pattern is divided into multiple local triggers and each local trigger is added by one of the colluding adversaries. At the inference time, the inputs are added with the same pixel pattern to trigger the backdoor. We adjust the configuration of each attack method to change the attack strength.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Three metrics are used for performance evaluation. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">benign accuracy (BA)</span> refers to the prediction accuracy on clean samples of personalized models when all the clients are benign. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">main task accuracy (MA)</span> denotes the prediction accuracy of a personalized model on clean samples under attack. The <span id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">attack success rate (ASR)</span> is the ratio of backdoored examples that are misclassified as the target label. Considering that different personalized models are obtained by each client, the average value of all the client models is used to measure each metric. An effective defense should reduce the ASR, while attaining a high MA when the training is corrupted by poisoning attacks. BA is the baseline with no attack. A practical defense should not degrade BA.</p>

For the models trained with FedAvg, RFA and Median, the attention maps on the clean image (top row) differ significantly from their attention maps of the poisoned image (bottom row). The attention of these trained models has been biased to the region where the trigger pattern resides. On the contrary, the attention maps on input with trigger are not shifted apparently for the federated models trained by SPFL, RLR and Fed-WBC. This explains why the LIE-5 attack was not successful on these methods in the earlier experiments. The average distance between attention maps of a trained federated model on clean input samples and on the corresponding backdoored samples can be used to quantify the effectiveness of mitigation. The smaller the distance between them, the less likely the backdoor can be successfully activated. This average distance for all samples in the test dataset is calculated for each defense method against LIE. The distances for SPFL, FedAvg, RFA, Median, RLR and FL-WBC are 2.09, 9.91, 10.03, 11.12 6.06 and 3.41, respectively. The smallest value of SPFL corroborates its greatest resistance to poisoning attacks.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a robust client-based defense against poising attacks in FL setting. It leverages attention-based self-distillation to independently purify the aggregated model received by each benign client to deliver credible performance guarantee. Our experimental results show that SPFL can mitigate a variety of poisoning attacks even if the number of adversaries and the attack frequency exceed the threshold defendable by state-of-the-art methods. Unlike existing defenses, SPFL raises instead of trades main task accuracy for security. As the self-distillation training needs only to be performed by the benign clients locally, SPFL is drop-in compatible and complementary with any aggregation methods, communication protocols and privacy-preserving protection schemes applicable to standard FL settings. It can be easily deployed to increase the Byzantine tolerance of a FL system without sacrificing the original quality and advantages attainable by other coexisting components.</p>
