<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Data-driven industrial health prognostics require rich training data to develop accurate and reliable predictive models. However, stringent data privacy laws and the abundance of edge industrial data necessitate decentralized data utilization. Thus, the industrial health prognostics field is well suited to significantly benefit from federated learning (FL), a decentralized and privacy-preserving learning technique. However, FL-based health prognostics tasks have hardly been investigated due to the complexities of meaningfully aggregating model parameters trained from heterogeneous data to form a high performing federated model. Specifically, data heterogeneity among edge devices, stemming from dissimilar degradation mechanisms and unequal dataset sizes, poses a critical statistical challenge for developing accurate federated models. We propose a pioneering FL-based health prognostic model with a feature similarity-matched parameter aggregation algorithm to discriminatingly learn from heterogeneous edge data. The algorithm searches across the heterogeneous locally trained models and matches neurons with probabilistically similar feature extraction functions first, before selectively averaging them to form the federated model parameters. As the algorithm only averages similar neurons, as opposed to conventional naive averaging of coordinate-wise neurons, the distinct feature extractors of local models are carried over with less dilution to the resultant federated model. Using both cyclic degradation data of Li-ion batteries and non-cyclic data of turbofan engines, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields accuracy improvements as high as 44.5% and 39.3% for state-of-health estimation and remaining useful life estimation, respectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Edge devices with powerful sensing and computing capabilities have grown from being a novelty to a utility, permeating all aspects of the modern industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. By bringing the benefits of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things closer to the end user for real-time analytics and decision making, edge devices play a critical role in Industry 4.0. Thus, proactive health management of these assets, through condition monitoring and timely predictive maintenance, is vital to prevent costly failures and ensure reliable operations. Life cycle costs of operating edge assets are also reduced with condition-based maintenance as a cost-effective balance between unplanned reactive maintenance and excessive preventive maintenance can be achieved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, developing industrial health prognostic models to guide condition-based maintenance has attracted significant scientific and industry interest, with a growing emphasis on data-driven models that can leverage the real-time data generated by edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Amongst data-driven methods, deep learning models have gained notable prominence due to their ability build accurate models from raw input data without needing extensive domain knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For instance, Chen <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> developed an attention-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model trained on sensor data to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines. Zhang <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> utilized discharging voltage and current data generated from a convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network to build a state-of-health (SoH) estimation model for Li-ion batteries. Zhu <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) for the RUL estimation of rolling bearings using vibration signals as model inputs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, an underlying assumption in existing studies is that the decentralized data from multiple devices can be centrally pooled for model training. In real industries, aggregating data is often unviable given stringent data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which limits the use and dissemination of sensitive user data. For example, battery health data from electric vehicles (EV) is beneficial to an EV manufacturer for the optimal selection of long-lasting battery types. However, collating battery health data generated from EV drivers is challenging as private user information such as driving patterns may be gleaned from just battery consumption patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. As a result, the wealth of data collectively held across edge devices cannot be harnessed in practice to train robust health prognosis models, covering a diverse range of practical operations and degradation patterns. Since deep learning models’ performance typically increases with data quantity and quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a lack of access to rich edge data may cap productivity gains from intelligent condition monitoring in Industry 4.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To meet the demand for privacy-preserving machine learning, several techniques have emerged, and they can be broadly classified into data masking-based or architectural approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Data masking is typically utilized when raw data is transmitted to third parties or a central server for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. A few notable data masking techniques are differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which apply well-designed noise perturbations to obfuscate sensitive individual data attributes, and homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which enable computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without having to decrypt it to the original form first.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, architectural approaches to privacy-preservation focus on redesigning centralized machine learning paradigms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Among architectural methods, federated learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> has garnered considerable research attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> as it facilitates both privacy preservation and decentralized data utilization simultaneously. This makes FL highly relevant for the problem of learning from edge data under privacy constraints, and is thus explored further in this paper. In FL, local data owners, also termed clients, collaboratively train a federated model without disclosing their data. Clients train their own models at the edge using their available data, and only model parameters (i.e., weights and biases) of the client models are communicated to the central server to build the federated model. The data remains with each client, thereby ensuring data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Presently, the most benchmarked FL algorithm is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, where local model parameters are aggregated by computing a coordinate-wise weighted average of the client models’ parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In existing works employing FL for machine condition monitoring, Zhang and Li <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> utilized FedAvg and transfer learning for fault classification of rolling bearings operating under variable conditions. Liu <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> similarly used FedAvg to construct a federated LSTM-based anomaly detector for engine operations. Going beyond fault classification, Rosero <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> applied FL for regression problems, where they compared the performance of federated models based on FedAvg and its variant, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> for RUL estimation of turbofan engines. In the aforementioned studies, though the underlying model architectures for the various condition monitoring tasks differed, FedAvg—with its coordinate-wise model parameter averaging scheme—was commonly used for developing the federated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, a shortcoming of FedAvg is that it implicitly assumes coordinate-wise neurons of different client models are learning similar features and hence, they can be averaged. In reality, even with homogeneous datasets across clients, there is no guarantee that the first neuron of a client model is learning the same feature extractors as the first neuron of another client model, and so on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Amidst data heterogeneity, the problem of averaging dissimilar, coordinate-wise neurons is exacerbated, with Wang <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> demonstrating that FedAvg converges to sub-optimal solutions when there are mismatched objective functions of different clients undergoing heterogeneous learning steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In a privacy-concerned era, intelligent health prognostics models can benefit significantly from FL because of the exposure to a wider range of operational and machine failure data than any single client’s dataset. However, employing FL techniques on industrial data is challenging due to inherent attributes of industrial data. Industrial data, typically sensor data, is noisy and temporal in nature. Consequently, neural networks such as LSTM, which effectively capture important long-term dependencies in long sequence time series <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, tend to have higher prediction accuracies in health prognostics than shallow architectures such as support vector machines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and even other standard deep networks such as CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and gated recurrent units (GRU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Thus, suitable FL techniques beyond naive parameter averaging are needed to ensure that the weights and biases of hidden states are aggregated meaningfully for the integrity of the overall federated model. Moreover, FL techniques also need to account for heterogeneous data across clients, even for devices of the same type. Data heterogeneity can arise among clients as machines experience dynamic and dissimilar degradation processes in practical conditions, and individual clients may have unequal training data (unbalanced data) from differing machine usage or data collection patterns.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity poses a critical statistical challenge for reliable FL as parameter averaging methods that overlook local heterogeneity dampens the federated model’s feature extraction capability and consequently, its predictive performance. Thus, there is a fundamental need for investigating new parameter aggregation algorithms that are suited to both the inherent heterogeneity of degradation data and the recurrent neural networks used for industrial health prognosis.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">In view of the challenges posed by client heterogeneity, we postulate that a more suitable parameter aggregation method for industrial health prognostics is one that explicitly considers each client model neuron’s feature extraction (i.e., features learnt from input data) and selectively aggregates the neuron parameters based on the similarity of extracted features. Thus, drawing inspiration from the matched averaging (FedMA) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> originally introduced for computer vision and language modeling, we develop a pioneering federated model for time series regression-based industrial health prognostics, which efficiently matches similar feature extractions from heterogeneous degradation data for a more discriminating parameter averaging. Specifically, the similarity between client model neurons is determined by their posterior probability distributions, and optimal matching of similar neurons is achieved by solving a neuron assignment cost matrix, formulated as a linear sum assignment problem. Since the FedMA algorithm only averages similar neurons, as opposed to FedAvg’s coordinate-wise averaging of potentially dissimilar neurons, the distinct feature extractors of client models are carried over to the federated model with less dilution, thereby boosting its predictive capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">As the seminal FedMA algorithm is designed for complex models with domain-specific components, such as two-dimensional convolution layers or word embedding layers, its applicability to industrial health prognostic models is not straightforwardly clear. Thus, to better suit the lightweight prognostic models used in edge devices, we introduce a customized FedMA algorithm that directly targets the core components of the prognostic model, e.g., temporal hidden states. Furthermore, as we implement the matched averaging of neurons modularly, one model layer at a time, the proposed method copes well with deep architectures, such as LSTM networks that are popularly used for industrial health prognosis. On the whole, our proposed FedMA-based health prognostics model is pivotal for demonstrating how the matched averaging algorithm, previously unconsidered for industrial health prognostics, can be formulated within an
end-to-end health prognostics framework, consisting of both offline federated model training and online prognostics on unseen test data.</p>

A well-studied example is the piecewise degradation modeling of turbofan engines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, where degradation is negligible during initial operations, but starts to occur continuously after some time in operation. For these industrial assets, RUL estimation is a health prognosis task of significant interest, where RUL is defined as the remaining length of operational time until an asset’s complete failure.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As an architecture well-suited for long sequence prediction, LSTM is commonly used in health prognostic models of critical assets, such as engines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, bearings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and batteries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The effectiveness of LSTM is due to its ability to keep track of important sequential dependencies in input data, even across long time periods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Compared to the structurally simpler GRU network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, LSTM also performs better on complex sequences and learning tasks due to its enhanced information retention abilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed FedMA-based health prognostics framework consists of two stages—offline federated model training with idle local clients and online inferencing using the trained model. Individual clients kickoff the offline modeling process by training their respective initial client models at the edge, using only their private data. To then build the federated model, a layer-wise matched averaging algorithm is applied to the initial client models, where the hidden neurons of different clients are matched and aligned based on similar feature extraction traits first before their weights and biases are averaged. These averaged parameters become the federated model’s parameters, which are subsequently distributed back to the clients for further rounds of collaborative federated model training. During online inferencing, clients employ the trained federated model for health prognosis tasks on incoming private test data. The steps of the proposed method are summarized in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B LSTM Neural Network for SoH and RUL Estimation ‣ II Preliminary ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

To develop an LSTM-based SoH estimation model, the feature data matrix has to be transformed into inputs that are suited for the LSTM architecture. First, the feature data are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance with respect to each process variable so that extreme values do not skew model training and convergence. Next, as the LSTM architecture requires fixed-length input sequences, the standardized feature data are segmented into smaller sequences determined by the shortest cycle to become <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\overline{\mathbf{X}}_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times T}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">𝐗</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.1.cmml">¯</mo></mover><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3.cmml">s</mi></msub><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">M</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">T</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1"><in id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.1"></in><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2"><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.1">¯</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.2.2">𝐗</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.2.3">𝑠</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3"><times id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1.1.3.3.3">𝑇</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.7.m7.1c">\overline{\mathbf{X}}_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times T}</annotation></semantics></math>, where scalar <math id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="T=\min\left\{T_{s}\right\}_{s=1}^{S}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1b"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.2">T</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.3">=</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.1">min</mi><msubsup id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4"><mrow id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2"><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2.1">{</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2.2"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2.2.2">T</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2.2.3">s</mi></msub><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.2.3">}</mo></mrow><mrow id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.3"><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.3.2">s</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.3.1">=</mo><mn id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.2.3.3">1</mn></mrow><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1.4.3">S</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.8.m8.1c">T=\min\left\{T_{s}\right\}_{s=1}^{S}</annotation></semantics></math>.

To aggregate the local model parameters meaningfully in the presence of client heterogeneity, neurons of different client models are considered layer-by-layer and matched based on their feature extraction similarity first before their parameters are averaged to form the federated model’s parameters. The mathematical formulation for the similarity-based neuron matching and the layer-wise matched averaging process for the federated model development are discussed below.</p>

Given the numerous permutations available, the coordinate-wise elements of different local clients’ weight vectors may not necessarily be representing similar feature extraction traits, even for homogeneous local datasets. Thus, the coordinate-wise parameter averaging of the FedAvg algorithm may lead to lower federated model performance due to dissimilar feature extractors (neurons) being averaged and the resultant dampening of feature extraction capabilities. Instead of coordinate-wise parameter averaging, FedMA matches the neurons of local client models based on their similarity first before averaging them to form the federated model neurons.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section evaluates the SoH and RUL estimation performance of FedMA-based models against the standard FedAvg-based models and importantly, the baseline local models without FL. Using two distinctly different datasets (Li-ion batteries and turbofan engines), the benchmarkable experiments have been thoughtfully designed to assess the generalizability and robustness of the studied FL methodologies in a variety of settings such as i) cyclic vs. non-cyclic degradation data, ii) cross-device FL within the same organization vs. cross-organization FL, and iii) device-level heterogeneity vs. organization-level heterogeneity. Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ III-C Online Health Prognosis ‣ III FL-based Industrial Health Prognostics using Matched Feature Extraction ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> summarizes the settings examined for each experiment. In addition to FL performance analysis, each experiment also discusses practical insights, such as the potential for training data efficiency in Experiment 1 and the interpretability of similar feature extraction traits in Experiment 2.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this problem formulation, each battery is a client requiring an accurate, on-device SoH estimation model. Under privacy constraints, clients have to develop their local models independently using only their respective datasets for model training. However, with FL, a richer federated model can be built through collaborative learning from multiple client models and utilized back by the clients. As the batteries are all of the same type, this experiment is akin to a real-world, cross-device FL setup within a single organization. The accuracy of the resultant federated model is evaluated.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The NASA battery dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> consists of 2 Ah-rated Li-ion cells that have undergone repeated charging and discharging cycles in accelerated ageing experiments. Conventionally, it is the discharging cycle that is relevant to SoH estimation as the discharging voltage, current, and temperature measurements form the input features for the capacity estimation model. The batteries were discharged from a voltage of 4.2V to a cut-off voltage of either 2.2V or 2.5V at a constant 2A current and an ambient temperature of 24°C (though the actual temperature of the battery varies as it heats up during the charge-discharge operations). Taking battery B0018 as an example, Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> illustrates the progression of the measured voltage and temperature time series within each discharge cycle for selected discharge cycles. Generally, the length of a discharge cycle, given by the length of the time index, decreases from the first cycle to the last.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the discharging cycles progress, capacity degradation also occurs until the end-of-life (EoL) capacity, defined as 70% of original rated capacity. Only battery data up till EoL are used for SoH estimation modeling, with the first 70% of cycles allocated for model training and the remaining 30% for testing. The salient attributes of the dataset are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. To examine the battery degradation patterns further, the capacity loss over the discharge cycles is plotted for each battery in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. It is evident that the capacity degradation follows a cyclic pattern—amidst the overall decreasing trend, there exists periodic localized peaks due to the capacity regeneration phenomenon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. Secondly, the three batteries exhibiting notably different capacity degradation pathways despite having similar discharging conditions reiterates the need for FL techniques that account for local data heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, the local model for each client battery is developed. Using only the first 70% of a battery’s own discharge cycles as training data, a LSTM-based SoH estimation framework is built to model the non-linear relationship between the feature variables, discharging voltage and temperature, and the capacity labels. The discharging current is not selected as a feature as the batteries were discharged at constant current and thus, the current measurements do not provide useful information about the capacity degradation process. Two key pre-processing steps are performed on the features to transform them as suitable LSTM inputs. Features are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance so that large values do not dominate and skew model training and convergence. As the LSTM model requires fixed length input sequences, the standardized feature time series are then segmented into sequences of a common length determined by the shortest discharge cycle as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. These feature sequences, together with their corresponding capacity labels, are consecutively fed into the LSTM framework to model the progression of capacity levels through the training discharge cycles and estimate the capacity, or equivalently, SoH for each battery’s test data (i.e., the earlier partitioned last 30% of discharge cycles). For the local model architecture, a lighter model is preferred for a lower communication burden between the server and the clients during FL. Keeping this in mind, the model variations listed in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> were assessed. All models were trained for 100 epochs with early stopping.

In contrast, the FedMA algorithm favors longer retraining and convergence of local models before the local model parameters are aggregated. Sufficiently converged local models ensure that the similarity matching of neurons are performed based on stable, high quality feature extraction traits. The FedMA-based federated model is constructed following Algorithm 1, with local model retraining conducted for 120 epochs within each communication round. Compared to the 100 epochs used for local model training in the baseline scenario without FL, the local model retraining for FedMA is understandably slightly longer since the collaborative learning among multiple clients exposes more degradation patterns to be learnt.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FedMA and FedAvg federated models were both trained up to 20 communication rounds. For each round, the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span> of the capacity predictions was computed to evaluate the federated model accuracy on local clients’ test data. The best federated model accuracy, the number of communication rounds needed, and the accuracy improvement over baseline client models without any FL are presented in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. Generally, the federated models outperformed client models trained on only their own data, which reiterates the crucial role FL plays in allowing local client models to benefit from a wider range of training data despite privacy constraints. Comparing the two FL methods, FedMA achieved at least 1.5 times larger accuracy improvements than FedAvg for all client batteries. While FedAvg needed less communication rounds to reach its best model, it also converged to sub-optimal results than FedMA due to its coordinate-wise parameter aggregation algorithm, which ignores local data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Against the known premise that more training data leads to better model performance, the scope for <span id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">data-efficiency</span> in FL was also explored since utilizing less clients offers practical advantages such as reduced communication burden and training time. For FedMA models, training on a smaller select subset of clients was viable, as shown in Table IV. Not only did the federated model accuracy significantly increase (lowest <span id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span>), the communication rounds required to achieve the best model also decreased. In contrast, FedAvg models generally worsened when trained on smaller client subsets (the additional FedAvg results are not reported for brevity). A possible reason for FedMA’s notable outperformance in this data-efficient scenario is that the beneficial presence of certain compatible clients is amplified by the matching of similar client neurons. The resultant aggregated federated model has sharper feature extraction capabilities and hence, accuracy. For an in-depth look into the SoH estimation performance of the FedMA federated model, Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> plots the predicted capacities against the ground truth labels for each client battery’s test data. Compared to the baseline client models trained on only their limited data, FedMA’s predictions exhibit remarkable closeness to ground truth capacities and their trend.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As an added evaluation criterion, the FL models are compared against the ideal setting, where there are no privacy constraints and edge data can be directly pooled for central training. This central training scenario should theoretically have the best model performance (and forms the upper bound for FL performance) because it is able to directly utilize all client data instead of relying on model parameter aggregation. As expected, the ‘Central’ models, reported in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, outperformed most client batteries’ local models trained only on local data. However, contrary to initial expectations, the ‘Central’ models consistently underperformed FL models, revealing a noteworthy advantage of FL. The underperformance of the ‘Central’ models in this experiment is likely due to the cyclic nature of battery capacity degradation data (as previously seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-A1 Data Description ‣ IV-A Experiment 1: SoH Estimation of Li-ion Batteries ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ A Federated Learning-based Industrial Health Prognostics for Heterogeneous Edge Devices using Matched Feature Extraction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>). As opposed to non-cyclic, monotonously decreasing data, centrally aggregating cyclic data of different batteries challenges the model’s ability to distinguish between regular cyclic patterns of the current battery and the start of the next battery’s discharge cycles. In contrast, FL models consider each battery’s model and indirectly, the data separately. Thus, they can reap the benefit of learning from multiple client batteries without being disturbed by cyclic noise.</p>

The dataset is a collection of 4 sub-datasets, FD001 to FD004, which vary in the number of engines, fault types, and operating conditions studied. For each sub-dataset, predefined sets of train and test engines are also provided.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the FD004 dataset, measurements for 21 sensor variables (e.g., pressure, temperature) are given for each operational time cycle of an engine. Following [10], sensors 1, 5, 6, 10, 16, 18, and 19 are not utilized for model training as they are either constant with time or exhibit erratic trends. The remaining sensors form the input features for the RUL estimation model. The RUL labels at each operational cycle of the train engines are not provided, but they can be constructed by taking the difference between the lifespan of the engine and the current operational cycle. Generally, it is more realistic to represent the progression of RUL as a non-linear, piecewise function because an engine’s RUL remains fairly constant initially and only decreases after some time in operation when degradation begins. The empirical value of 130<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, commonly used in turbofan engine literature, is used as the initial constant value for the RUL.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FD004 test engines have the same feature variables as the train engines, but the data are only provided up to some random time before failure for each engine. Thus, the remaining operating cycles before failure, i.e., RUL, is not known. The problem setup is that the local clients are tasked with estimating the RUL of the test engines, which may have a different lifespan distribution from the client’s available training data. Using each client’s train engine data, an LSTM-based RUL estimation model relating the sensor data and the piecewise RUL labels is developed for the baseline client models.
The best model architecture for the client models, which also forms the basis for the federated models, is determined in a manner broadly similar to Experiment 1. The sensor data are standardized first (zero mean and unit variance) and then fed into the LSTM model as smaller, uniform-length input sequences for model training.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of the baseline client models with no FL varies widely depending on the degree of client heterogeneity. While the model performance of homogeneous clients was fairly uniform (as evidenced by the narrow <span id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span> range of 32.27 to 36.15), the heterogeneous clients had extremes, with very good models (HT2 with an <span id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span> of 27.76) and very poor models (HT3 with an <span id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span> of 44.87). Nonetheless, the federated models outperformed all the baseline client models, highlighting once again the crucial need for FL if high-accuracy machine health prognostics models are to be achieved under privacy constraints. Between the two FL methods, the FedMA federated model consistently topped FedAvg’s performance in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, with its <span id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RMSE</span> in the heterogeneous setting being only 1.8% lower than the theoretical best performance established by the ‘Central’ model. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, FedMA performs better with higher quality local models. Thus, it is entirely consistent that FedMA’s outperformance to FedAvg was more pronounced in the heterogeneous setting, which had a high-quality local model (HT2). Due to its similarity matching algorithm, FedMA is able to benefit from the presence of high-quality local models to a greater extent as the feature extractors from good local models are not diluted by naive parameter averaging.

Thus, space complexity is a greater concern for the client side than the central server.

For instance, our SoH estimation model has 68K parameters, which is a fraction of the 4.2M parameters of MobileNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, a popular parameter-efficient neural network for edge device deployment.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper argues that, in an increasingly privacy-concerned era, federated learning (FL) is critical for allowing local clients to learn from a diverse range of decentralized data and build high-quality industrial health prognostic models. Particularly, we proposed a feature matching-based FL model for SoH and RUL estimation of critical machinery, and demonstrated its aptness for building accurate federated models amidst heterogeneous degradation data obtained under complex practical conditions. The proposed approach outperformed both the baseline client models without FL and the standard Federated Averaging model due to its algorithm averaging only client neurons with similar feature extraction traits, which ensures that the helpful feature extractors of local client models are carried over undiluted to the resultant federated model. Amidst the nascency of FL studies for time series regression-based machine health modeling, our study is pivotal for spurring research into effective parameter aggregation methods for FL-based industrial health prognostics. Though the prognostic tasks studied in this paper use long short-term memory networks, the study can be extended to other deep neural networks in the future because the matched averaging is performed modularly layer-by-layer. Thus, as part of future works, the structurally simpler GRU network can be investigated for developing lighter health prognostics models in edge devices. Additionally, the technical feasibility of using an ensemble of privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy-enabled FL will also be studied for industrial health prognostics. Finally, as the current neuron matching algorithm allows for the nonparametric growth of the federated model and thus, susceptible to poisonous attacks, adversarial techniques to enhance the robustness and fault tolerance of the proposed model will be explored in future works.</p>
