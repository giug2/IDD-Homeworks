<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">When machine learning models are trained on synthetic data and then deployed on real data, there is often a performance drop due to the distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we introduce a new ensemble strategy for training downstream models, with the goal of enhancing their performance when used on real data. We generate multiple synthetic datasets by applying a differential privacy (DP) mechanism several times in parallel and then ensemble the downstream models trained on these datasets. While each synthetic dataset might deviate more from the real data distribution, they collectively increase sample diversity. This may enhance the robustness of downstream models against distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments reveal that while ensembling does not enhance downstream performance (compared with training a single model) for models trained on synthetic data generated by marginal-based or workload-based DP mechanisms, our proposed ensemble strategy does improve the performance for models trained using GAN-based DP mechanisms in terms of both accuracy and calibration of downstream models.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The success of modern machine learning (ML) techniques hinges on access to vast amounts of high-quality training data. However, data sharing presents significant challenges due to inherent privacy risks. In 2023, 19% of data breaches were attributed to compromises with business partners, and in the U.S., the average cost of a data breach reached $9.44 million <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Additionally, stringent data protection regulations, such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and CCPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, restrict the external sharing of data or its transfer across geographic boundaries. Therefore, there is both a business and scientific imperative to develop solutions that allow data curators to share data reliably (without worrying about privacy leakage) and efficiently (with streamlined end-to-end implementation). Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution and contemporary generative models can produce content that is very close, or even indistinguishable, in quality to human-made content. On the other hand, generative models might inadvertently memorize and reproduce specific details from the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Consequently, it is crucial to train these models in compliance with privacy standards.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A burgeoning body of research is focused on developing differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see, e.g., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
They can be broadly classified into three categories: (i) GAN-based mechanisms train generative adversarial networks with DP guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>; (ii) marginal-based mechanisms select several subsets of features, compute their joint distributions, add noise, and then fit a graphical model or neural network to match the noisy distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; (iii) workload-based mechanisms select a set of workload queries and generate synthetic data aimed at minimizing the approximation error for the chosen queries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Despite the differences, all these mechanisms share a common goal: produce synthetic data that retains key information (such as statistical properties) from the original private dataset while ensuring that adversaries cannot identify individual personal data from the released synthetic data.
A significant application of synthetic data is to allow downstream users to train their ML models, with the expectation that these models will maintain their performance when applied to real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Existing studies have observed that ML models trained on private synthetic data can underperform when applied to real data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This performance gap arises because synthetic data typically follows a different probability distribution than real data. Several factors can cause this distribution shift, including noise introduced to ensure DP guarantees, the limited size of training data, and inherent limitations of generative models or the training paradigm. Additionally, synthetic data may not capture the full diversity of real data because generative models tend to avoid producing data from domains with limited real data to meet privacy constraints. Yet, these outliers can be pivotal for training certain downstream models, such as SVMs. Given these challenges, it is crucial to develop a systematic approach for training downstream models with synthetic data while addressing distribution shifts and lack of sample diversity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Ensemble learning trains multiple predictive models and aggregates their predictions to achieve more accurate and reliable outcomes than individual models can provide.
At the heart of ensemble methods is to ensure diversity among individual models. In our context—training downstream models using synthetic data—we identify an additional source to amplify model diversity: the noise introduced in DP synthetic data generation mechanisms.
By applying a privacy mechanism multiple times in parallel to real data, we generate synthetic data with diverse distributions. This approach is particularly beneficial for GAN-based privacy mechanisms, which are prone to mode collapse and hard to fine-tune due to privacy constraints.
We demonstrate that injecting different noise in GAN-based mechanisms can significantly improve sample diversity and enable downstream models to be more robust against distribution shift. As a result, these models are more likely to maintain their performance when deployed on real data.</p>

Specifically, we fix a predefined privacy budget, divide it among several DP synthetic data generation mechanisms, and apply each mechanism to produce synthetic data. We then evaluate the performance of downstream models trained on this ensemble dataset against models trained on synthetic data generated using the entire privacy budget. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments using state-of-the-art DP mechanisms and various benchmark datasets. Our key observations are:</p>

<p id="S1.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Ensemble learning is a standard strategy in supervised learning, aimed at enhancing model accuracy and reliability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Traditional methods include bagging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, boosting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and Bayesian model averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. For deep learning models, there are also advanced ensemble techniques such as Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and deep ensemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. To encourage diversity among individual models, various strategies have been suggested, for instance, deliberately manipulating the randomness during the model training process or training each model using a random subset of the available data and features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
However, when these methods are applied to synthetic data, their effectiveness hinges on the quality of the generative model. A mode collapse in the generative model can drastically diminish the diversity of training samples, subsequently affecting the diversity of the ensemble models. In contrast, we suggest repeatedly applying DP mechanisms (within a set privacy budget) to produce more diverse synthetic data. Our experiments (Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Results. ‣ 4 Numerical Experiments ‣ Private Synthetic Data Meets Ensemble Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) show that for GAN-based privacy mechanisms, this method can improve both the accuracy and calibration of models compared to the naive application of ensemble learning techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper is inspired by a remarkable work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, which proposed learning multiple generative models to produce diverse synthetic datasets, training individual downstream models on each dataset, and aggregating their predictions. They empirically observed that this simple approach achieves superior downstream performance and uncertainty quantification than training with a single synthetic dataset.
However, when considering privacy constraints, each generation of synthetic data could potentially expose private information from the original dataset. Given a set privacy budget, producing more private synthetic datasets means allocating a smaller privacy budget to each DP synthetic data generation mechanism, consequently affecting the quality of the produced datasets.
In our experiments, we find that the benefits of using multiple generative models under a fixed privacy budget differ based on the privacy mechanisms employed. For marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms, the gains in downstream performance are negligible (see Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Results. ‣ 4 Numerical Experiments ‣ Private Synthetic Data Meets Ensemble Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
This observation aligns with the “no free lunch” result in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which considers uncertainty quantification of models trained on real data and demonstrates that an ensemble of smaller neural networks often performs similarly to a larger neural network under comparable computational costs.
On the other hand, for GAN-based mechanisms, an ensemble with multiple generative models improves downstream performance (see Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Results. ‣ 4 Numerical Experiments ‣ Private Synthetic Data Meets Ensemble Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another fundamental property of DP is privacy amplification by subsampling. It suggests that the privacy guarantees of a DP mechanism can be enhanced by applying the mechanism to a random subsample of the original dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. This property can be particularly useful if computational or memory constraints restrict the use of a DP mechanism on the entire dataset. Below, we recall a result regarding Poisson subsampling, and for more on different subsampling schemes, refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">A limitation of these traditional approaches is that their effectiveness hinges on the quality of the synthetic data generated by the privacy mechanism. In practice, GAN-based privacy mechanisms are prone to mode collapse and can be challenging to fine-tune due to privacy constraints. If synthetic data fails to accurately capture the real data distribution, the efficiency of downstream models may decrease, even with multiple models in an ensemble.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we introduce “<span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DP ensemble</span>” and its variant (see the second pipeline of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Private Synthetic Data Meets Ensemble Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for an illustration). This approach applies a privacy mechanism multiple times to generate a variety of synthetic datasets. Although the distribution of each individual dataset may diverge more from the original data distribution than a dataset generated from a single run of the privacy mechanism, collectively they demonstrate a higher sample diversity. This increased diversity can enhance downstream models, making them more robust against distribution shifts.</p>

We consider two metrics: accuracy and expected calibration error (ECE). The latter measures the uncertainty of a model by taking the difference between its prediction confidence and its true prediction accuracy.
In practice, ECE is approximated by binning the confidence probabilities into discrete intervals of equal width and assigning each data point to a bin based on the model’s prediction confidence:</p>

In order to compute ECE, the model must output a confidence probability for each prediction.
Then, the ensemble’s output is the average of its member classifiers’ confidence.
Because an SVM model does not naturally support confidence outputs, we use Platt’s scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> to convert the model’s margin into a probabilistic confidence.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DP synthetic data plays a pivotal role in enabling companies to share data for analytical or ML tasks without risking privacy breaches. However, synthetic data can be noisier than the original data and follow a different probability distribution due to the noise introduced to ensure DP. Consequently, ML models trained on synthetic data may suffer from a performance reduction when applied to real data. In this paper, we introduce several ensemble strategies for training downstream models. Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we found that (i) for synthetic data generated from marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms, ensemble strategies do not offer notable improvements compared to models trained <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">without ensemble</em>; (ii) for synthetic data generated from GAN-based methods, <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DP ensemble + subsampling</em> outperforms all other strategies in terms of calibration and test error when training downstream models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe there is a crucial need for future research to understand how ensemble strategies impact the performance of downstream models. For example, it would be interesting to provide an impossibility result that theoretically explains why ensemble strategies do not enhance downstream model performance for marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms.
Additionally, one can potentially further improve our ensemble strategies by reserving a hold-out set from real data and using it to select synthetic data generated by different invocations of the privacy mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another promising direction for future research is to develop a more robust learning paradigm that trains ML models with synthetic data while taking into account potential distribution shifts. Existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see, e.g., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> have found that given sufficient data, marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms are effective in preserving statistical properties of the real data distribution, particularly those characterized by workload queries. It would be interesting to leverage this property and apply distributional robust optimization (DRO) to train ML models that can maintain their performance upon deployment on real data.</p>
