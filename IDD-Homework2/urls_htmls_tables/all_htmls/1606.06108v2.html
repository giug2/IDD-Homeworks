<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) task not only bridges the gap between images and language, but also requires that specific contents within the image are understood as indicated by linguistic context of the question, in order to generate the accurate answers. Thus, it is critical to build an efficient embedding of images and texts. We implement DualNet, which fully takes advantage of discriminative power of both image and textual features by separately performing two operations. Building an ensemble of DualNet further boosts the performance. Contrary to common belief, our method proved effective in both real images and abstract scenes, in spite of significantly different properties of respective domain. Our method was able to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in real images category even without explicitly employing attention mechanism, and also outperformed our own state-of-the-art method in abstract scenes category, which recently won the first place in VQA Challenge 2016.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent rise of deep learning methods including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) has escalated a large number of artificial intelligence tasks to an unprecedented stage, where the performance frequently rivals that of humans. Tasks such as object classification, scene classification, and object detection demonstrated the ability to correctly recognize and locate the images both holistically and regionally, whereas tasks such as caption generation or object retrieval demonstrated that deep learning methods can successfully bridge the gap between images and language. Visual question answering (VQA) task further promotes the boundary of deep learning applicability and complicates the problem by necessitating multiple prerequisites, potentially encompassing all of the above-mentioned capabilities; as it needs to understand the question, locate or classify the objects/scenes mentioned in the question, and generate appropriate answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce DualNet, which attempts to fully exploit the discriminative information provided by the images and textual features, by separately performing addition and multiplication of input features to form a common embedding space. As we shall see in Experiment Section, it shows clear advantage over performing only one operation, and outperforms many recent state-of-the-art methods, without using any attention mechanism. Furthermore, it turns out that building an ensemble of DualNets with varying dimensions leads to even more superior performances, despite feeding identical set of input features to all DualNet units.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another advantage of our DualNet is that it is applicable to both real images and abstract scenes categories. So far, it has widely been considered that successful methods for real images cannot be directly ported to abstract scenes domain, as they have fundamentally different characteristics. In fact, applying the basic setting of fc7 features for images and long short-term memory (LSTM) with one hidden layer for questions, which results in 58.16 for real images, yields only about 55 in abstract scenes domain. Indeed, most of the previous papers on VQA have tackled only one domain, presumably due to such reason. Our DualNet, however, results in superior performances in both domains, demonstrating that it is applicable to a wider domain, provided that features are plausible.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is also noteworthy that we do not employ any attention mechanism, which has become one of the most common approaches in VQA. While useful, building attention mechanism necessitates a separate stage of training to map language to specific regions of image, and complicates the procedure. Instead, our method demonstrates that basic set of features can provide rich amount of information without building attention mechanism, provided a network is designed in a way that fully exploits the features’ discriminative capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper is hereafter structured as follows; In Related Works, we review the recent innovations and trends in VQA, and briefly discuss how our method diverts from them. In Method, we describe both the motivation behind and the implementation details of our DualNet architecture. In Experiment, we apply our proposed model to actual VQA dataset and discuss the results with examples and comparisons to other methods. Finally, we conclude the paper and discuss future work in Conclusion.</p>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) task itself has only recently been introduced with the advent of dataset provided by (<span id="Sx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), consisting of 0.25M images, 0.76M questions, and 10M answers. They also report baseline results from methods with multi-layer perceptron and LSTM (<span id="Sx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA: Real Images</span> Real images category is currently by far the more popular and competitive task in VQA. (<span id="Sx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) introduced Ask Your Neurons. Unlike the baseline provided by (<span id="Sx2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), in which image features and question features are embedded to common space at the last stage prior to classification, they built a system where image features are shared at each LSTM unit for processing question features. They also performed comparison of different operations for fusing input features, and concluded that summation performs better than multiplication. In our work, however, both summation and multiplication are performed, which demonstrates significant improvements.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many recent papers reporting competitive results have relied heavily on various types of attention mechanism. (<span id="Sx2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) introduced stacked attention networks (SANs), which relies on semantic representation of each question to search for relavant regions in the image. More specifically, they built multiple-layer attention mechanism, which locates the relevant region multiple times so that more accurate region of interest can be retrieved.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In a similar manner, (<span id="Sx2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) attempts to locate relevant regions in the image. They map the textual queries to features from different regions by embedding them to a common space and comparing their relevance via inner product.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(<span id="Sx2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) proposed a number of improvements to dynamic memory network (DMN). Their proposed DMN+ model introduced a novel input module based on a two-level encoder with sentence reader and input fusion layer, and implemented memory based on gated recurrent units (GRU).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(<span id="Sx2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) proposed focused dynamic attention (FDA) model, which exploits an object detector to determine regions of interest. LSTM is used to embed the region features and global features into common space.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">(<span id="Sx2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) proposed spatial memory network in which neuron activations of different spatial regions are stored in memory, and regions with high relevance are chosen depending on the question. The latter step was made possible by their novel spatial attention architecture designed to align words with patches.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike most of the works mentioned above, our work does not employ any attention mechanism, yet demonstrates superior performance by fully exploiting features provided to the network.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA: Abstract Scenes</span> Relatively few results have been reported on abstract scene categories compared to real images.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">(<span id="Sx2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) converted the questions to a tuple containing essential clues to the visual concept of the images. Each tuple (P, R, S) consists of a primary object (P), secondary object (S), and their relation (R). Mutual information was employed to determine which object corresponds to primary object and secondary object. They also augmented the dataset using crowd-sourcing in order to balance the biases in the dataset. Their visual features included histogram-like vectors for primary and secondary objects, as well as absolute and relative locations of the objects modeled by GMMs. We show that this model’s performance is enhanced by addition of deep features, both holistically and regionally, and applying our DualNet further improves the performance.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Method</h2>

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we describe the details of our proposed network architecture “DualNet”, which we demonstrate to work well both on real images and abstract image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it performs well on various combinations of image features when combined with sentence features from encoders such as LSTM.</p>
</div>
<section id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Motivation</h4>

<div id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the VQA task, it is necessary to determine how to combine visual features with sentence features because a network cannot answer correctly unless they have enough knowledge about what the questions are asking and which features are necessary to answer them correctly. Figure 1 shows an example of fusing features which employs element-wise multiplication (<span id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). There are other options to fuse the features such as element-wise summation. Some of the previous works have examined and compared the behaviors of network depending on the fusing mechanisms (<span id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). According to them, the performance of network varies depending on the way the image features and sentence features are fused. This indicates that, even with non-linearity of network, the information can vary according to the fusing methods. Most architectures only used one method to fuse the features; for example, summation or multiplication only.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the features combined with different fusing methods should contain different information. For example, some information should be preserved (or lost) only by summation, whereas some are preserved only by multiplication. For this reason, we propose to integrate two kinds of operations, namely element-wise summation and element-wise multiplication. Moreover, we propose to use different kinds of image features. The motivation is to fully take advantage of different information present in different kinds of features. For example, holistic features used in abstract scenes (<span id="Sx3.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) display completely different characteristics from CNN features. Likewise, for CNN features, different network structures also result in different characteristics of the extracted features. Thus, our DualNet benefits further by exploiting a combination of features from different networks and different methods.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset consists of 82,783 training images, 40,504 validation images and 81,434 test images. 3 questions are attached to each image. We can evaluate the model by using a subset of test split called test-dev split on the VQA evaluation server. In this experiment, we used both train and validation splits for training, and tested on both test-dev and test splits. Since the number of test submissions for the complete test split is limited, the evaluation on the complete test split was restricted to selected key methods.</p>

The batch size was 300 and learning rate was set to 0.0004. We optimized the hyper-parameters based on the evaluations on test-dev split.</p>

For the ensemble of DualNets, we set the common space dimensions differently for each unit. We changed common space dimension from 500 to 3000 for each DualNet unit in our ensemble, which consists of 19 DualNet units. We tuned the weight for each unit in the ensemble based on their result on test-dev split.</p>

<div id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">1) Avg.

We run selective search for each image, which returns approximately 1,000 region proposals for each image. Using Fast-RCNN, we extract fc7 features from all regions. Dimensionality of fc7 features is reduced to 256 using PCA. We then concatenate 8-dimensional coordinate vector (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max, x_center, y_center, width, height) as in (<span id="Sx4.SSx2.SSSx2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) so that each region is 264-dimenisonal.

LSTM with one hidden layer of 256 hidden units was employed. Training was performed for 100 epochs.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Results &amp; Analysis</h3>

<div id="Sx4.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table 1 shows the results of each method on test-dev split, and Table 2 reports results on test-std split.
As shown in the tables, we outperformed the previous state-of-the-art methods on real image category published prior to the 2016 VQA Challenge.
We can clearly see the effectiveness of our network structure through comparison to the summation-only network and multiplication-only network. The multiplication network
obtained 59.15 and summation network obtained only 56.81. The performance of summation network is much poorer than multiplication network. However, when combining two
paths, we were able to improve the performance significantly. This indicates that the two paths extract different kinds of information from more than three kinds of features, reminiscent of the way ”And” and ”Or” gates behave in electronic circuits.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing with the methods such as DMN (<span id="Sx4.SSx3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) , SAN (<span id="Sx4.SSx3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and FDA (<span id="Sx4.SSx3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), which used the attention mechanism, our model still achieves better performance. This indicates that we can construct an efficient model without explicitly including spatial information from local features. It also suggests that the image features from VGG and ResNet must contain spatial information to a useful extent, since our model demonstrates high performance on the questions that require the model to have knowledge about particular image regions in order to answer correctly. Figure 4 shows examples of questions and generated answers in real images along with the images.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for abstract image, our DualNet method significantly outperformed the result of Baseline2 which won the first place VQA Challenge 2016. The idea of combining two paths proves to be effective when using different kinds of image features for abstract images as well. Although many works have been published for VQA, few works have tackled the task with abstract image dataset. We suspect that this is because the abstract scenes dataset is too small to construct a large network architecture, which frequently includes attention mechanism. Due to the small number of training samples, training complex network can decrease the performance. On the other hand, in our model, the architecture is so simple that our model is not influenced by the limitation of samples. Figure 5 shows examples of questions and generated answers in abstract scenes along with the images.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implemented DualNet to efficiently and fully account for discriminative information in images and textual features by performing separate operations for input features and building ensemble with varying dimensions. Experiment results demonstrate that DualNet outperforms many previous state-of-the-art results and that it is applicable to both real images and abstract scenes despite their fundamentally different characteristics. In particular, we were able to outperform our own previous state-of-the-art results on abstract scenes category, which recently won the first place at VQA Challenge 2016. Since our method was able to perform well even without attention mechanism, it will be an interesting future work to examine the combination of DualNet and attention mechanism.</p>
