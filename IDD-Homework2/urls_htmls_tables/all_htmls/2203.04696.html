<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the development of machine learning
and speech processing,
speech emotion recognition has been a popular research topic in recent years. However, the speech data cannot be protected when it is uploaded and processed on servers in the internet-of-things applications of speech emotion recognition. Furthermore, deep neural networks have proven to be vulnerable to human-indistinguishable adversarial perturbations. The adversarial attacks generated from the perturbations may result in deep neural networks wrongly predicting the emotional states. We propose a novel federated adversarial learning framework for protecting both data and deep neural networks. The proposed framework consists of i) federated learning for data privacy, and ii) adversarial training at the training stage and randomisation at the testing stage for model robustness. The experiments show that our proposed framework can effectively protect the speech data locally and improve the model robustness against a series of adversarial attacks.

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Voice operated smart edge devices – e. g., Amazon Alexa and Google Nest
– are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives.
These devices have benefited from recent advancements within the field of
Machine Learning (ML), where deep neural networks
represent the current state-of-the-art approach for analysing
speech and recognising emotional states <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In this paper, we address two topical challenges within this area:
<em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data privacy</em> and
<em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">robustness
towards adversarial attacks</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite recent advances, the performance of ML models remains upper-bounded
by the quality and quantity of the samples used for training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
This limitation has implications for the field of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).
The data used in this area often contains private / sensitive information, especially when emotion recognition is applied in mental health applications, e. g., detection of depression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, while smart edge devices may record an abundance of data,
there are concerns regarding the extent to which
these devices may leak private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
These concerns – along with strict legal and ethical requirements
designed to protect user privacy –
can prohibit the pooling of user data for <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">centralised</em> ML model training,
a practice that often results in a better model.
Thus, due to the lack of data from different sources,
it can become a challenge to build ML models that are effective
for SER.
Here, Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as an alternative to centralised
learning, allowing data holders to collaboratively train a <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global</em> model without physically sharing
their data.
Instead, participants – in our case, the users of the smart edge devices – train a
copy of a model with local data and iteratively share the resulting parameter
updates, often via a centralised entity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, thanks to FL, a <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global</em> model can be obtained without the users’ data
leaving their respective devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While FL takes steps towards mitigating privacy concerns when training
models using real-world data, questions remain regarding model robustness.
In recent years, there has been an abundance of literature
demonstrating the vulnerability of deep neural networks towards adversarial
attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Adversaries are capable of learning to perturb a small set of pixels
within a given sample, barely perceptible to humans, but capable
of causing a misclassification.
Such attacks are increasingly being used to fool models deployed on smart devices,
often with malicious intent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
This creates the need for models that are robust towards adversarial attacks,
as well as principled methodologies for measuring robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we take steps towards addressing the challenges outlined above.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, we propose the first pipeline to protect federated learning with a comprehensive approach in the domain of SER. Our contributions can be summarised as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">i.) A federated learning framework for SER is constructed to protect each speaker’s data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">ii.) To protect SER models trained with federated learning against a range of adversarial attacks, we propose and compare two single-stage federated defence modelling strategies: adversarial training at the training stage and randomisation at the testing stage. Especially, our experiments demonstrate that randomisation on log Mel spectrograms extracted from speech signals is able to protect the SER models against adversarial attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">iii.) Finally, we show that our proposed two-stage defence modelling approach, i. e., the combination of adversarial training and randomisation, effectively improves the model robustness over vanilla federated learning (i. e., nature) and federated learning with a single stage of defence.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is an essential part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research.
Real-life HCI applications have been facilitated by research on automatic emotion recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>,
thus improving quality of service and quality of life <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The speech signal is one of the key ways for humans to communicate, since it contains a substantial amount of paralinguistic information (i. e., emotion states, attitudes, etc.) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In past decades, SER has been a particularly useful research topic for HCI to recognise emotion from speech signals with the methods of computational paralinguistics and machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In SER tasks, speech signals are often annotated with continuous values (i. e., <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">arousal</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">valence</em> and <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">dominance</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>) and/or discrete labels (e. g., the ‘Big Six’ proposed by Ekman <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>: <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">anger</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">disgust</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fear</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">happiness</em>, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sadness</em> and <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">surprise</em>).
The continuous and discrete labels can be converted to each other using a circumplex model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past years, a set of acoustic features have proven to be effective for distinguishing emotions from speech, including low-level descriptors (e. g., energy features and spectral features) and statistical functionals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. With acoustic features, classic machine learning approaches (e. g., support vector machines) have been successfully employed to analyse emotional states from speech signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In contrast to classic machine learning, deep learning
mostly
deals with either raw speech signals or time-frequency representations, and often shows better performance than classic machine learning in recent advances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Compared to 1D raw speech signals, 2D time-frequency representations have become more popular <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Typical time-frequency representations include spectrograms, Mel spectrograms, log Mel spectrograms, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In this work, we will use log Mel spectrograms as the input of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to the Mel scale’s linearity in the human ear’s auditory properties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and log Mel spectrograms’ good performance as the input of CNNs in acoustic tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL has become a popular solution for applications
that can benefit from a decentralized,
collaborative and privacy preserving learning process.
Application domains that can benefit from an FL approach include:
intelligent industrial production <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and, the focus of our current study, SER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
FL consists of a number of client machines
hosting a decentralized training dataset,
where each sub-dataset
resides and remains on the respective client machine
throughout the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Instead of sharing data, the clients share the parameters
of an ML model, typically via a centralized server
hosting a <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global model</em>, or via a decentralized
peer-to-peer topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
This global model can be downloaded by each client
to perform <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local</em> updates.
After a specified number of epochs, each client sends
their optimized model parameters back to the server,
where they are aggregated – for instance using federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
The aggregated parameters are subsequently made available for
download, and the next training <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">round</em> can begin.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The digital transformation in mobile networks and computing has recently led to a dramatic increase in the number of Internet users, connections, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, as well as network capabilities and application requirements.
With the digital proliferation,
increasingly sophisticated attack strategies
are
emerging to take the offensive against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
A thorough investigation has been conducted on the vulnerability of DNNs to various malicious attacks capable of creating adversarial examples with the goal of breaking the prediction of DNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
There are two major categories of these attacks:
1) <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">white-box attacks</em> that consider the available model architecture;
2) <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">black-box attacks</em> without any knowledge of the model architecture.
Regardless of the category, the goal of most attacks is to perturb the inputs of DNNs with so-called adversarial examples in such a way that the new examples are indistinguishable to humans. The new false examples can mislead the prediction model and produce incorrect results. Compared with black-box attacks, white-box attacks tend to generate more imperceptible and thus stronger perturbations. Therefore, we focus on the more challenging white-box attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

In order to fight against the adversarial examples, adversarial training was proposed and initially utilised to train the neural networks with a mixture of adversarial examples and original clean signals to improve the robustness of neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

Max-Margin Adversarial (MMA) was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> to directly maximise the margins to the decision boundary and minimise the adversarial loss on the decision boundary at the <span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\say</span>shortest successful perturbation.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While there exist a few research studies on federated learning for SER, as well as adversarial attack on SER in centralised settings,
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, our work is the first exploration of improving federated learning’s capability for privacy protection against adversarial attacks in this area.
The potential benefits of FL for SER’s typically sensitive data – and ability to deliver promising results compared with SOTA approaches – were highlighted in a recent study by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
A number of real world applications have been identified for Federated-SER, including: monitoring the general mood of elderly in care homes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>; the healthcare industry in general, a vulnerable sector that often falls victim to cyber-attacks and data breaches, where data is typically highly sensitive and distributed in nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>; multi-modal (i. e., face video and speech) emotion recognition systems to improve work culture and the environment in
post-pandemic times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>; and depression treatment robots that do not need to transfer users’ videos and conversation data to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We note that there have also been recent works focused on <em id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">privacy attacks</em> on Federated-SER, where the goal is to retrieve / recover sensitive information from trained models, typically as a result of the models over-fitting on the training data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.
A further concern are model <em id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">poisoning attacks</em>, where FL participants deliberately attempt to sabotage the model so that
it misclassifies specific samples, potentially those of relevance to competitors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>.
Model poisoning attacks differ from the white-box attacks that are the focus of our current work, since for white-box attacks, the goal is to perturb samples to cause a misclassification at <em id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">inference time</em>.</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A comprehensive summary of FL challenges – including communication costs, resource allocation, privacy and security – can be found in a survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, for SER in centralised settings, there exists a number of works on adversarial attacks and corresponding defence schemes.
An end-to-end scheme was proposed to generate adversarial emotional speech data in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, the first black-box adversarial attacks were used to deceive SER systems, and adversarial training and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were explored to enhance the SER model’s robustness.
Furthermore, a similarity-based adversarial training was proposed to protect SER models against white-box adversarial attacks in our prior study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
As improving the transferability of adversarial attacks can facilitate the investigation of improving SER models’ robustness, the transferability of black-box adversarial attacks was enhanced by lifelong learning in another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There have also been numerous studies on defensive methods, e. g., adversarial training and ensemble diversity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.
However, most of them are not suitable for distributed devices or for distributed machine learning.
The main reason is that the devices are scattered and may be exposed to different attacks simultaneously.
The first attempt to adopt the concept of FL to provide a defence framework against various white-box attacks on distributed networks was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

However, the approach assumes an <em id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">attack monitor</em> capable of determining which type of white-box attack is being applied.
In contrast, our current work focuses on mitigating the effects of adversarial attacks on Federated-SER at inference time through randomisation, an approach that works well on image data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenges discussed in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we introduce a novel federated learning pipeline for SER that is robust towards white-box attacks on speech data (cf. <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 5 The Proposed Methodology ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 1</span></a>).
Under the assumption that each client already has its own speech data, our pipeline consists of three components. First, we employ a data pre-processing module that extracts the log Mel spectrograms from speech signals of each client. The log Mel spectrograms are further used as the input of SER models. Second, we propose a federated adversarial learning module, which is the defence strategy at the training time. Specifically, in the federated adversarial training module, the SER models learnt by FL in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Federated Learning ‣ 2 Background ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a> are defended with adversarial training illustrated in Section <a href="#S2.SS4" title="2.4 Adversarial Training ‣ 2 Background ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4</span></a>. Finally, a randomisation module for defence at the inference time is proposed to further improve the SER models’ robustness with the approach of randomisation outlined in Section <a href="#S2.SS5" title="2.5 Randomisation ‣ 2 Background ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.5</span></a>.
In the following, we will give details about each of the three modules.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">By fine-tuning the hyperparameters for randomisation, we pursue two goals.
First, randomisation has a minimal impact on the models’ performance on the original data.
Second, it mitigates the adversarial attacks’ effects on the models’ performance.
Using a small enough range has been shown to have no significant effect on model performance on the original dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.

Because federated learning aims to perform on each speaker’s data in a long-term manner for personalised SER-related applications, we divide the database into a training set and a test set with a speaker-dependent strategy rather than the ‘classic’ speaker-independent one. Each actor’s speech is divided into an 80 % training set and a 20 % test set, each of which composes the global training set and test set, respectively. The emotion distribution is described in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table II ‣ 6.1 Dataset ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</p>

We set the audio sample length as the maximum one as 5.884 seconds, which means shorter audio samples will be self-repeated.
We set the sliding window as 512 time frames, the overlap as 256 time frames, and the Mel bins as 64

The models are evaluated on the original (unperturbed) test data every 10 rounds.
The four mentioned models converge to a UAR score of around 90 % with diverse convergence times. We can see that, the three federated adversarial training algorithms share similar convergence speed with the nature model, where all models herein converge after 150 rounds. Therefore, we conduct further tests for the above models after 150 rounds until the final 300 rounds, every 10 rounds.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 5</span></a>, there are three major findings. Firstly, <a href="#S6.F5.sf1" title="Figure 5(a) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F5.sf2" title="Figure 5(b) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> show that adversarial learnt models perform better than nature models; the randomisation layer herein itself does not significantly reduce the model’s performance. Secondly, from <a href="#S6.F5.sf3" title="Figure 5(c) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a>, we can see that our adversarial training strategy is successful, helping models fight against the adversarial attacks, besides DeepFool.
Thirdly, by comparing <a href="#S6.F5.sf3" title="Figure 5(c) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F5.sf4" title="Figure 5(d) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(d)</span></a>, we can observe that randomisation can further help mitigate the effects of adversarial attack, especially for nature models under FGSM, PGD and DeepFool attacks and adversarial federated learnt models under DeepFool attacks.
However, we do not see an improvement for the federated adversarial models under FGSM and PGD attacks after randomisation.
Our evidence supports that
adversarial training is the key step in defending the models against the FGSM and PDG attacks under our settings, which have strong transferability. On the other hand, DeepFool is more likely to over-fit on the target models, and thus randomisation can better help to destroy the structure of the perturbations.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p3.3" class="ltx_p">From Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table III ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments and Results ‣ Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, there are several observations. Firstly, for both the nature models and federated adversarial trained models, randomisation is successful in mitigating the adversarial attacks. When we apply randomisation onto the original test dataset, the performance only drops by a small amount (usually less than absolute 1 % on UAR). When randomisation is applied on the generated adversarial examples, it improves considerably the performance.
This is because randomisation probably destroys the specific adversarial perturbations pattern <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, randomisation helps the models mitigate the DeepFool attack, improving the UAR from

This result is consistent with existing work in the literature, where single-step attacks (e. g., FGSM) and PGD were shown to be more transferable and less prone towards over-fitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
However, we observe that the adversarial training does not help the models to mitigate the DeepFool adversarial effects.
The reason is that DeepFool iterates until the generated attack samples successfully fool the classifier, in which process DeepFool is more likely to over-fit on the specific models, and has less transferability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study demonstrates a novel pipeline that can be used to efficiently mitigate adversarial white-box attack on SER data. In this section we consider: the main takeaways from our work with respect to the performance of our two layer defence against adversarial attacks; a comparison with work on centralised training on DEMoS; and finally, considerations regarding future work that could be conducted with our pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">White-box attack comparison:</span>
In our work, we analyse two types of adversarial white-box attacks, single-step attacks (i. e., FGSM) and iterative attacks (e. g., DeepFool). Overall, our findings are consistent with previous work on adversarial attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After conducting the experiments, we come to the conclusion that single-step attacks are weaker than iterative attacks, but more transferable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
By comparing the effects of adversarial training on defending against single-step and iterative attacks,
we observe that adversarial training mitigates better the effects of single-step attacks (i. e., FGSM) than iterative attacks (e. g., DeepFool). We believe that the cause for this is due to the nature of the iterative attacks, which perform multiple iterations to find the minimal perturbations that can fool the classifier.
In other words, perturbations generated by iterative attacks tend to over-fit on the parameters of the specific classifier  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, which makes the iterative attacks more powerful. Thus, adversarial training doesn’t effectively defend against the iterative attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As a result, we propose the randomisation – the second defence strategy within our pipeline – to be more effective, via utilising resizing and padding by random proportions on the test data at inference time. By this, randomisation tends to destroy the specific structures of perturbations.
Our experimental results agree on the previous statement, and show that the added randomisation makes the models more robust against iterative attacks, where DeepFool attacks are applied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison with centralised training:</span>
The VGG model architecture that we use in our experiments is similar to the one utilised in the study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The use-case was for the centralised adversarial training on the DEMoS corpus in order to reduce the impact of the FGSM attack where a highest UAR – 86.7 % was achieved on the unperturbed original test data and 82.1 % on the perturbed test data.
However, in that work, data is split to training, developing &amp;testing, in a speaker-independent way, where training data contains a set of speakers that were not present in the test data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In our work, on the other hand, the data is split in a speaker-dependent way.
As a result of the splitting strategy that our FL workflow restricts by design, a direct comparison between our results and those from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> cannot be made.</p>

<p id="S7.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Future work:</span>
In the future, our work can be extended and further evaluated, below we discuss three directions that we are particularly keen to explore.
Firstly, in real-life communication scenarios, clients (e. g., mobile devices) are distributed in various environments and with different languages. And potentially, each client can have a different dataset. This raises the research question of how our framework will perform and how robust can the learnt FL model be in such heterogeneous environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, if attackers use an ensemble of adversarial examples generated by different algorithms, how does our workflow defend against the unseen adversarial attacks? and to what extend does it generalise over these new attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Thirdly, there are also numerous opportunities for applying our pipeline within a different domain. For instance, in the context of intelligent industrial production, where the datasets are recorded on industrial production machines (e. g., computer numerical control machines) via acoustic and vibration analytic devices. How transferable is our federated adversarial learning framework to this domain, and how does it perform and defend against adversarial attacks in such a scenario?</p>

</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we proposed a framework that is composed of two defence stages, the first is the federated adversarial training that at the training time and the other one at the inference time, to mitigate white-box adversarial effects on the federated learnt speech emotion recognition models. We conducted experiments on the database of elicited mood in speech using the VGG-15 architecture against three attack methods. The experimental results indicated that adversarial federated learning can better fight against attacks with higher transferability and that randomisation works better on stronger iterative DeepFool attacks. By combining the two defence strategies together, we achieved significant improvement under adversarial attacks. In particular, the unweighted average recalls on the randomised adversarial test dataset were 90.15 % for the fast gradient sign method attack, 89.20 % for the projected gradient attack and 72.32 % for the DeepFool attack.
These findings make federated learning in speech emotion recognition appear a sound option to help collect sufficient experience for tomorrow’s engines in real-world applications.</p>
