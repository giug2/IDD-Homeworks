<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In response to the challenges posed by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and the escalating threat of privacy attacks in Federated Learning (FL), we introduce HyperFedNet (HFN), a novel architecture that incorporates hypernetworks to revolutionize parameter aggregation and transmission in FL. Traditional FL approaches, characterized by the transmission of extensive parameters, not only incur significant communication overhead but also present vulnerabilities to privacy breaches through gradient analysis. HFN addresses these issues by transmitting a concise set of hypernetwork parameters, thereby reducing communication costs and enhancing privacy protection. Upon deployment, the HFN algorithm enables the dynamic generation of parameters for the basic layer of the FL main network, utilizing local database features quantified by embedding vectors as input. Through extensive experimentation, HFN demonstrates superior performance in reducing communication overhead and improving model accuracy compared to conventional FL methods. By integrating the HFN algorithm into the FL framework, HFN offers a solution to the challenges of non-IID data and privacy threats.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on data security due to increased awareness of privacy protection and the evolution of laws. However, in the era of big data, the continuous generation of diverse data by electronic devices poses challenges. This data contains personal privacy information and is unsuitable for transmission to centralized servers for data mining or machine learning purposes. For example, input prediction technology has significantly enhanced the accuracy of word suggestions, making typing more convenient and enjoyable. While training neural networks requires substantial data support, many owners of private data are reluctant to share it. Conversely, there is an increasing availability of computing resources from various devices. In this context, Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has emerged as a solution to address this dilemma. FL is a novel distributed technique that enables multiple parties to collaborate in training neural network models by transmitting only the parameters of the training network without sharing the dataset. This collaborative approach allows users to achieve common goals and benefit from the learned models while safeguarding their privacy. However, the development of FL faces challenges related to communication cost and data heterogeneity. As device computing power increases, the complexity of model structures grows, necessitating the transmission of hundreds of thousands or even millions of parameters between users’ devices and the server per round. Consequently, the communication traffic overhead for users becomes substantial. This issue often leads to devices participating only when connected to WiFi, limiting the number of available devices and resulting in suboptimal model learning for FL tasks. Additionally, data heterogeneity arises from variations in user behavior, domain differences, and the disparity in data volume between individual users and institutional users. Data heterogeneity poses a significant obstacle that hinders the improvement of model accuracy and can even impede model convergence. Effectively addressing communication resource conservation and personalized federated learning (pFL) are crucial yet challenging aspects in the field of FL. Existing methods in FL have not adequately tackled these two challenges simultaneously.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our work introduces a novel algorithm called HyperFedNet (HFN) to address the challenges of personalized training tasks and heterogeneity in FL. HFN leverages the advantages of Hypernetworks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to transmit a small number of parameters for personalized training in FL. Hypernetworks are neural networks that generate parameters for another network, allowing for more efficient communication. To tackle the heterogeneity problem in FL, we propose a representation method that quantifies different heterogeneous features using embedding vectors. These embedding vectors serve as representation vectors, capturing the characteristics and diversity among different objects. By mapping objects to different locations in the embedding vector space, we can effectively address data heterogeneity. In FL, users can utilize features learned by other users to improve their own model performance. The communication in FL aims to enable the main network to learn from users’ strengths. By leveraging the generalization ability of neural networks and using a small neural network to generate appropriate parameters for the main network based on different embedding vectors, we can effectively handle traffic overhead. Instead of communicating with the main network, we design a hypernetwork that communicates parameters via input embedding vectors. Each local model is represented by a unique and learnable embedding vector, serving as input to the hypernetwork. This allows the hypernetwork to specify the characteristics of the local model structure and provide appropriate outputs. The hypernetwork acts as a coordinate map of a low-dimensional manifold in the embedding vector space, where each unique user model structural parameter is constrained and parameterized by the embedding vector<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The pFL is a way to solve the dilemma of FL in the face of data heterogeneity. Users’ and organizations’ location, country, habits, or research directions lead to wide variations in the type and amount of local data stored on the device<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For example, city cameras are more likely to capture pictures of humans and cars compared to forest cameras. Many researchers have worked on solving the problems posed by this data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have proposed many pFL methods. Data augmentation is a technique that transforms or expands the original data to generate new training samples to balance data heterogeneity. In order to balance the differences between clients, some researchers have proposed the use of data augmentation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Due to the feature detection limitations of local models, some algorithms try to add proximal terms<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The training process of the local model is constrained and adapted to force a closer approximation of the global model’s objective so that a more suitable model can be obtained. This approach can be achieved by adding appropriate penalty or regularization terms to the objective function. In the case of large differences in the probability of occurrence of different categories in the database, the model may favor the more frequently occurring categories and perform poorly on the less frequent ones, which may lead to a decrease in the overall accuracy of the model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is based on the probability of occurrence of each category, and logits are calibrated before softmax cross-entropy in the expectation of higher accuracy. A single global model may not fit well when faced with non-iid user data. Partially pFL learns a unique model for each user to get better learning gains. These algorithms try to go for the balance between shared knowledge and personalization. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> aggregates only the basic layer while retaining the personalization layer, but requires all users to participate in every round, which is not feasible in the FL environment. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> finds an initial shared model based on migration learning, knowledge distillation, and meta-learning, respectively, and based on the initial model, the users fine-tune the model locally to obtain their own personalized model. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> fixes the personalization layer during training, and after convergence, the local data is used to fine-tune the model to obtain a localized model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The use of data augmentation, meta-learning, and other techniques in FL introduces the risk of data leakage, as it involves some form of data sharing, which contradicts the original purpose of FL. In contrast, the HFN adheres to the fundamental principles of FL without exchanging any data. While adding proximal terms to the model is a simple approach, it carries the risk of overfitting and reduces the model’s generalization ability. This approach relies on the existence of a global model as a reference to guide the local models towards convergence. However, the quality and accuracy of the global model are crucial for the effectiveness of pFL. If the global model is flawed or biased, it can negatively impact the training of personalized models. In the HFN algorithm, the model’s effectiveness does not solely rely on the global model but also incorporates the embedding vector and personalization layer, which significantly reduces the risk of overfitting. Calibration methods in FL usually make assumptions about the fixed and known data distribution, assuming that the probability of each category’s occurrence remains constant. However, real-world data distributions are often dynamic, and the probabilities of category occurrences may change over time or in different environments. This can lead to calibration method failures or the need for frequent adjustments. In contrast, the HFN implicitly represents the probabilistic features of the user database using a embedding vector and a personalization layer. These dynamic parameters continuously update and adapt as the model learns. A single global model is not well-suited for highly non-independent and homogeneously distributed data scenarios. Training the network using the model decoupling approach still subjectively transmits all feature knowledge to the user without targeting personalized knowledge for the main network. As a result, users are unable to obtain their own unique knowledge, leading to slow convergence, high communication overhead, and poor modeling results. The HFN algorithm, on the other hand, generates different knowledge for different users, enhancing convergence speed, and improving the model’s effectiveness.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a distributed machine learning approach in which model parameters and updates need to be exchanged frequently between users for collaborative model training. The large number of parameter transfers leads to expensive communication overheads for the users. The high communication cost not only has an impact on the overall performance, but also poses a challenge to devices with limited bandwidth and energy, thus constraining the development of FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. As a result, several research efforts have been devoted to reducing the amount of communication between users. A common approach is to compress and encode model parameters using compression techniques to reduce the bandwidth required for transmission<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. For example, some researchers have utilized global models to construct submodels and send the submodels to the users through lossy compression. Each user performs local updates on the smaller model and provides updates that can be applied to the larger global model on the server. The whole process reduces the transmission by constructing the submodel once and compressing it twice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, some work focuses on reducing the frequency of communication. For example, researchers have proposed strategies to increase the number of local computation epochs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, determining the optimal number of local computation epochs is a key issue, and to address this issue. The study by Reisizadeh et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduces the periodic averaging method and quantizes its updates based on the quantizer’s accuracy before uploading to the parameter server, thereby lowering communication overhead. In addition, several research works look at reducing the communication overhead in hierarchical federated learning systems<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For example, Deng et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm to minimize the communication overhead from edge aggregation and cloud aggregation. Some academics combine methods from other fields, He et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed to utilize knowledge migration instead of traditional transmission transfer, where instead of sending the network parameters back to the server, the user sends feature maps with fewer parameters and associated logs to the server, which utilizes this information to train a convolutional neural network with a larger model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compressing and encoding model parameters can introduce noise and lead to information distortion, potentially resulting in reduced model performance. Additionally, the compression and decompression processes between users and the server incur computational overhead. This overhead becomes particularly significant for large models, which may outweigh the benefits gained from compression. Moreover, when employing optimization methods that increase local computing rounds, the heterogeneity among users, including differences in computing capabilities and data distribution, can pose challenges. Adding more local computational epochs may further amplify this variability, leading to poorer training performance for certain users. Quantization operations, similar to model compression, can result in information loss. Representing the model with low-precision values may not accurately capture the intricacies and complexity of the model, necessitating more training iterations to compensate for the loss of detail. Moreover, when areas such as knowledge transfer are combined with FL, transmitting only feature maps and related logs without transmitting network parameters can lead to information loss. Consequently, the server can only use local information for training and may not be able to acquire a complete understanding of the model.</p>

Before training, the FL server will initialize a global model to solve the objective function. In each iteration cycle, the server randomly selects some users to participate in training and delivers the global model parameters. After the selected user receives the global model, it is set as a local model and trained using its local data. The training process can use standard machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent. After training, the locally updated model parameters are transmitted back to the server. The server uses an aggregation algorithm to aggregate the parameters uploaded by the user, generates a new global model, and performs the next round of iterative training until the preset accuracy is reached or the model converges.

Since data is kept locally and only model parameters are transmitted, FL provides a privacy-preserving mechanism that helps reduce the risk of data leakage and privacy violations. Especially in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be processed, such as healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hypernetwork is a special type of neural network structure, usually containing one or more hidden and output layers, which has dynamically adjustable parameters. Hypernetworks can be used to generate weights, parameters, or architectures for other neural networks, thus enabling adaptive or automated network design during model training. As shown in Fig.<a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-B HyperNetworks ‣ III Preliminaries ‣ HyperFedNet: Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Learning Via Hypernetwork" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a hypernetwork accepts a parameter sampling vector as input during training. The hypernetwork uses this input to generate parameters for other neural networks, which are generally called the main network. The parameters of the main network are no longer learned by the main network itself, but are updated by receiving the output of the hypernetwork. The hypernetwork transforms this input into parameters for other neural networks through a complex internal mechanism. These generated parameters can be seen as a kind of search space for exploring the possibilities of different network architectures or weights. The generated parameters are used to construct a specific neural network architecture. This process can be translated into an actual network architecture by some predefined rules or algorithms, e.g., using generative adversarial networks or by hypernetwork tuning. The generated network architecture is used for forward and backpropagation of the training data. Typically, the output is computed by forward propagation using the generated network weights, then the loss is computed based on a given loss function and the parameters of the hypernetwork are updated by a backpropagation algorithm. During training, optimization can be performed by iteratively updating the parameters of the hypernetwork and generating the sampling vectors of the network. This process can be implemented using traditional gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Optimizing the communication overhead for FL is an important issue. Computer vision tasks occur frequently in FL. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the main algorithms for computer vision tasks. CNN extract abstract features of the input data layer by layer through multiple convolutional layers. In a typical CNN, most of the model parameters are located in the filters of the convolutional layers. However, traditional transmission methods directly use the CNN model as a global model, and directly transmitting the parameters of each filter in a CNN leads to heavy communication overhead. We attempt to adopt an approach that takes advantage of the powerful generalization and mapping capabilities of the hypernetwork to generate a large number of parameters in the convolutional layer of the main network by mapping them through the hypernetwork.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the experiment setup, including the experimental environment and baseline algorithm. Firstly, we show how the hypernetwork generates parameters under similar data distributions. Subsequently, we highlight the advantages of the transmission hypernetwork over the transmission main network in terms of privacy preservation. We also report on the impact of varying embedding vector size on both communication volume and accuracy. Furthermore, we present the results of experiments conducted by the HFN on different real datasets. Finally, we show the effectiveness of combining HFN with other algorithms.</p>

The larger value of PSNR indicates that the attacked reconstructed image is more similar to the original image.

On the contrary, the information transmitted by HFN algorithm is completely resistant to the attacks of DLG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> and iDLG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">HFN introduces a latent hyperparameter, the size of the Embedding Vector, which is related to the performance and communication overhead of FL. To investigate the relationship between them, we conducted experiments to explore the impact of different embedding sizes on accuracy and communication volume. As shown in Fig.<a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-D The Affect of Embedding Vector Sizes on HFN ‣ V Experiments ‣ HyperFedNet: Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Learning Via Hypernetwork" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the red line represents the Cost per Round (CPR) for individual users, which corresponds to the right y-axis. CPR is composed of the parameter quantity transmitted by each user in one round, including both upload and download. It is important to note that the values represent the number of parameters transmitted in the network, not the actual network traffic. The other colors represent the accuracy achieved after convergence in FL, which corresponds to the left y-axis. The green line corresponds to MNIST, the purple line corresponds to FMNIST, the orange line corresponds to CIFAR-10, and the black line corresponds to CIFAR100. Comparing the iid and non-iid (solid and dashed lines), it can be observed that in the non-iid setting, as the embedding vector size increases, the improvement in accuracy is more significant compared to the iid case. This is because in the non-iid scenario, the variations in data distributions among different users require the convolutional layers of different users to extract more diverse feature information. This necessitates a larger embedding vector for assistance, resulting in a notable increase in accuracy as the embedding vector size increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding communication overhead, the communication cost of HFN increases with the increase in embedding size. The communication overhead of most FL algorithms is similar to FedAvg. We calculated the CPR of FedAvg for individual users for the MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, which are 155K, 1127K, 1128K, and 4519K, respectively. Comparing the different embedding sizes of HFN in Fig.<a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-D The Affect of Embedding Vector Sizes on HFN ‣ V Experiments ‣ HyperFedNet: Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Learning Via Hypernetwork" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the communication overhead is significantly higher. However, when employing an embedding vector size of 1, the CPR of HFN on the four datasets is only 640. Therefore, the HFN algorithm has an advantage in terms of communication overhead. This graph allows us to flexibly balance accuracy and communication overhead based on practical requirements, enabling the selection of an appropriate embedding vector size.</p>

In most cases, the HFN algorithm demonstrates good performance, especially when the dataset is complex. When HFN comes to process the simpler MNIST dataset, average performance may be observed. This can be attributed to the relative simplicity of the MNIST dataset and the simpler model structure used. In the MNIST dataset, the image has a lower image resolution and the digit patterns are relatively simple, so a simple model can be used to extract enough features for classification. In this case, the introduction of a hypernetwork may increase the complexity of the model and make the task relatively more complex, resulting in less remarkable accuracy. It is worth noting that hypernetworks were originally designed to handle more complex tasks and models. It is when applied to more complex datasets (CIFAR series) and models that the benefits of HFN become more significant. This is because the choice of model parameters can be more critical in complex tasks, and the hypernetwork can provide more appropriate parameters by adaptively generating model parameters that produce higher accuracy.</p>

It can be seen that HFN not only has a significant advantage in convergence speed, but also has an unrivaled advantage in communication cost. It is worth noting that the advantage of HFN in reducing communication costs is due to its ability to generate model parameters locally without the need to transmit large amounts of raw data. This local generation of parameters reduces the amount of data transfer between users and improves the efficiency of FL. Therefore, HFN can better solve the problem of communication overhead in FL by reducing the amount of data transfer between users while producing better accuracy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another major advantage of HFN is that it can be easily combined with existing algorithms, by which the advantages of HFN can be attached to existing algorithms and benefit from other algorithms. We simply experimented by fusing HFN with other partially baseline algorithms, and obtained the Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-E Performance Evaluation ‣ V Experiments ‣ HyperFedNet: Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Learning Via Hypernetwork" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. Where ACC indicates how much the algorithm has improved on the original accuracy after fusion, for example, the accuracy of FedAvg at CIFAR10 non-iid is 69.95%, and HFN+FedAvg is 83.33%, then the corresponding value of ACC in the table should be recorded as 13.38%. We also counted the corresponding communication consumption of the algorithms from the beginning of training, all the way to the final accuracy, compared with the fused algorithms. The percentage in Comm means the percentage of the total communication consumption of the new algorithms after fusing the HFN algorithms to the original total consumption. It can be noticed that the communication efficiency of all the baseline algorithms is greatly improved by combining HFN. In some cases, the total amount of communication exceeds 100<math id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS6.p1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which is reasonable due to the fact that the convergence accuracy has been improved more than the original and more communication rounds are needed to achieve higher accuracy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we explore and utilize the potential of hypernetwork in FL. Compared with the previous traditional architecture, using the hypernetwork instead of the main network for communication learning greatly saves the communication cost, improves safety and the powerful learning ability of the hypernetwork also improves the accuracy of the main network. We verified the performance of traditional algorithms and HFN under different datasets with different distributions through a large number of experiments, and then did many targeted experiments on HFN and fused this novel approach into the traditional FL method to achieve better results.</p>
