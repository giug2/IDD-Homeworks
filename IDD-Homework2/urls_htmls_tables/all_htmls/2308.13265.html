<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) allows several clients to construct a global machine-learning model without having to share their data. However, FL often faces the challenge of statistical heterogeneity between the client’s data. The heterogeneity of the clients will affect the global model’s effectiveness. In this paper, utilizing the Domain Adaptation concept, we define an upper bound for the risk of a global model for every single client and theoretically prove that minimizing heterogeneity between clients minimizes this upper bound. We mainly focus on the heterogeneity in the distribution of data across feature spaces of the clients rather than merely considering imbalanced classes, which have mostly been studied in the literature until now. Therefore, with a primary focus on cross-silo settings, we propose a method called FedGenP, which uses server-trained, client-specific generators for knowledge transfer between clients. Each generator aims to provide samples for the corresponding client to minimize its discrepancy with other clients. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data, along with a theoretical study, support the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that the generated data helps in constructing a well-generalized global model. In addition, because of the generators, after fine-tuning the global model with both the local and generated data, the clients need not lose the information from others, resulting in well-generalized personalized models as well.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an approach to train machine learning models while the data are distributed between different clients (data owners). A typical setting in FL has a server organizing the clients to learn a model, namely the global model, collaboratively. FedAvg is the most well-known FL introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. In FedAvg, the server receives the local models (models the clients train locally) and calculates their average as a global model. The server sends the global model back to the clients. This communication, namely the federated communication step, will be repeated until the convergence of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering a federated system, heterogeneity may be present at different levels, including data, model, and communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ye et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. For this study, we specifically focus on a system with heterogeneity at the data level. In other words, we address statistical differences in the data that is available among the clients.
The statistical heterogeneity in clients’ data affects the performance of the global model; the global model may not uniformly benefit all clients due to this phenomenon. While improving performance for specific clients, others may be disadvantaged by participating in the federated process. By this motivation, minimizing the negative effects of the heterogeneity of the data on the performance of the federated model(s) is a hot topic in the FL community.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We examine the challenge of heterogeneous clients in FL from a Domain Adaptation (DA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Blitzer et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite> perspective. The central assumption in machine learning is that training and test data are independently and identically distributed, so-called the IID assumption. However, in reality, data may originate from different domains and violate this fundamental assumption. DA is an approach that reduces the distribution gap between the domains, namely Source and Target <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Taghiyarrenani <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. In the context of DA, the objective is to build a model specifically for the target domain. However, due to insufficient data from the target domain, the approach involves utilizing available data from the source domain. Given the differences between the domains, DA minimizes the distribution gap between source and target data, ensuring the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) assumption for training a model.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL context, data originates from different clients, which we equate to the domains in the DA context as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Taghiyarrenani, Nowaczyk, and
Pashami <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Therefore, it is probable that they follow different distributions and affect the global model results. In this regard, we first theoretically show that the heterogeneity between one client and the rest of the clients affects the performance of the global model on that client. We construct this discussion from DA’s point of view. However, a key distinction lies in the fact that while DA assumes data from different domains being available, FL does not permit such access to data from the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In dealing with data from diverse clients, we can create a shared model by averaging local models, as in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. However, this approach is significantly impacted by data heterogeneity. On the opposite end of the spectrum is constructing completely personalized models for each client, which, however prevents the exchange of information between them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Finding a balance between these extremes, Personalized FL aims to gain knowledge from different clients while constructing personalized models for each client to mitigate bias introduced by vastly different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Many different personalized approaches have been proposed in the literature to handle the heterogeneity of the clients, with a recent survey providing comprehensive overview <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. One particularly relevant technique among them is Data Augmentation. Data augmentation is widely used in machine learning as it enhances the diversity of samples, contributing to improved model generalizability. This technique is also beneficial when dealing with data from various domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Taghiyarrenani and Berenji <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, as it contributes to reducing the disparities between them.
Data augmentation can also be utilized in the FL setting. However, many existing data augmentation methods mainly focus on addressing class imbalances among clients by augmenting the clients’ data to achieve a class balance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes data augmentation techniques in the FL setting that minimize the discrepancy between the clients. Building on theoretical discussions, our objective is to diminish heterogeneity between each client and the rest through data augmentation. Unlike previous approaches, our aim is to address and reduce heterogeneity resulting from data distribution between clients.
To this end, we propose a method (FedGenP) in which the server trains personalized generators for each client based on the local models of other clients. In this way, by generating new synthetic data and augmenting the client’s data, the generator will transfer knowledge from other clients. The generators are designed to create data in areas of space where there are discrepancies between clients. However, in order to keeping privacy, they generate data in a latent space instead of the input space. By doing so, and aligning with the theoretical discussions, our goal is to remove heterogenity between the clients and consequently improve the performance of the global model for every client.</p>

Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gao, Yao, and Yang <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> survey all types of heterogeneity in FL, including statistical heterogeneity, and categorize the approaches to tackling the statistical heterogeneity into two groups: single global and personalized local models. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ma et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, however, just focus on the statistical heterogeneity and categorize different types of heterogeneity and also different approaches to solve the problem.

Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yao et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> also use knowledge distillation techniques to guide local models by the ensemble of previous global models.

One-shot knowledge distillation is suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gong et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>; It uses an unlabeled public dataset as a proxy dataset.

<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The core idea of this work is minimizing the discrepancy between clients, which adversely affects the performance of the global model. Our method addresses this issue by learning client-specific (personalized) generative models, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#Sx5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Our proposed method ‣ Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Personalized Generative Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. These personalized generative models are constructed using the local models and will generate data in a latent space, which ensures FL’s privacy concerns.
To establish intuition, we present a federated system with two clients in Figure <a href="#Sx5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Our proposed method ‣ Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Personalized Generative Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, representing the training process for a generator associated with Client 1. The black dot points indicate where the generator generates data. The black arrows represent the direction toward the center point of Client 2, while the blue arrows indicate the reverse direction toward the center point of Client 1. First, the generator is one step trained to reach the center point of client 2. Subsequently, in the next step, the generator is trained to reach the center point of Client 1, but during training, we reverse the direction of its gradient; in fact, it will move away from the center point for Client 1. In other words, our approach guides the generator to generate data from areas that Client 1 lacks but which can be provided by Client 2.</p>

<p id="Sx5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The complete process of the proposed FL method (FedGenP) is as follows. At initialization, the algorithm starts at the server, initializing the global model’s parameters and broadcasting it to the clients. The clients will train their own models using the data available locally and send the local models back to the server. After the initialization stage, the algorithm iterates until convergence, alternating between server-side and client-side stages.</p>

The task selected for prediction is a binary classification to predict whether or not the celebrity in the image is smiling.
The clients are simulated to include different individuals within the dataset. This arrangement inherently introduces discrepancies between the samples available to each client, reflecting the real-world heterogeneity in distributed environments. More specifically, this dataset simulates the heterogeneity for which our method is designed, namely heterogeneity resulting from statistical heterogeneity in the features, not from the imbalanced classes across the clients.</p>

It is important to note that this method of creating heterogeneity results in imbalanced class distributions among different clients. Nevertheless, we also designed experiments in which the amount of data owned by each client is limited by reducing the proportion of the entire training dataset that is distributed among the clients. This is particularly designed because this limited data can also introduce heterogeneity between the client’s model.
We report two sets of results for each of the three datasets. The first set of results is the results of the global model on a global test dataset. These results are indicated by the name of the method. For this purpose, the global model is evaluated immediately after aggregation on the global test dataset.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As can be seen, FedGenP in a personalized version outperformed the other methods significantly, as expected from this dataset that contains a significant amount of heterogeneity in features. The exception pertains to the experiment conducted with the parameter (r) set to 0.2. As the proposed generator in our method works based on all clients’ models, when there are not enough active clients in the system, the generator struggles to create samples with adequate diversity. This could explain why, in this particular scenario, the results do not exhibit as significant a margin as in the other cases.
In a non-personalized analysis, our method’s outcomes are also effective compared to FedGen. It’s crucial to note that FedGen requires clients to share class statistics <math id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P(y)" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml">P</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml">y</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2"><times id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.1"></times><ci id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.2.2">𝑃</ci><ci id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1.1">𝑦</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx6.p7.1.m1.1c">P(y)</annotation></semantics></math>, while our method operates without this, increasing privacy. This distinction becomes especially important in cross-silo scenarios, such as involving various companies as clients.

</div>
<div id="Sx6.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p8.1" class="ltx_p">If we compare the results of the FedGen and (Per)FedGen, we can see that there is not a remarkable difference between them. This is because the generator of FedGen generates data in the space where all clients agree. This data effectively aligns the sample space of every client. Thus, while the generator of FedGenP generates data in the part of space where heterogeneity exists, these diversifying samples actually result in local models that agree and are more generalizable. Consequently, it shows better performance even on the cross-client test data.</p>

<p id="Sx6.p9.1" class="ltx_p">One thing to note is the weak result of the (Per)FedAvg. According to the reported deviation, which is more than 2, we can conclude that FedAvg cannot converge with only 100 communication steps.</p>

For this dataset, we consider six different settings based on the percentage of the data used as training data, which is distributed among the clients, and the parameter alpha. Alpha controls the heterogeneity between clients by allowing imbalanced classes to be created. Additionally, when clients have less training data distributed among them, the local models may differ and be in conflict with each other, i.e., heterogeneous clients. Using both settings, we explore how our proposed method behaves when heterogeneity is present in different forms.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Our method outperforms other approaches when working with smaller data, such as utilizing only five or ten percent of the training data. This advantage arises from the fact that reduced data can magnify distribution discrepancies between clients, aligning with our method’s design focus and thus showcasing its superiority. Nevertheless, in scenarios where each client possesses a substantial amount of data (when utilizing all available training data), the FedGen proves capable of resolving the issue. This is due to the similarity among clients in this situation, resulting in the absence of conflicts. Consequently, our designed generators fail to provide additional benefits to individual clients. Thus, the deployment of one generator, presented by the FedGen, remains sufficient. However, we should note that when compared with FedGen, our method does not require statistics about classes, i.e., <math id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P(y)" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml">P</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.1.cmml">y</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2"><times id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.1"></times><ci id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.2.2">𝑃</ci><ci id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1.1">𝑦</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx6.p12.1.m1.1c">P(y)</annotation></semantics></math>.

Our method does not outperform other methods when using all available training data to simulate the clients since there will be no heterogeneity between the samples. However, when there is heterogeneity, and specifically when there is insufficient data to distribute between the clients, our method is superior to the others by removing the heterogeneity. More particularly, our method is efficient on this dataset when utilizing just 10 percent of the training data and setting alpha to 0.01, indicating high heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="Sx6.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Up to this point, we have always used a local epoch of 20 in all of our experiments. However, since our method utilizes generators constructed based on the local model, the convergence of the local models when every client trains it locally significantly impacts the final results. One of the factors contributing to the convergence of local models is the number of local epochs, so we examine how it affects the final results. Therefore, we use the MNIST dataset with 5 percent of the training data distributed to twenty clients, set the alpha to 10, and calculate the output with local epochs 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Table <a href="#Sx6.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ Experiments ‣ Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Personalized Generative Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> summarizes the results. Clearly, having a higher number of local epochs increases performance. Nevertheless, with fewer communication steps, we achieve nearly equivalent results, highlighting the superiority of our method in the presence of heterogeneity. This holds particular significance in the context of heterogeneous FL. As claimed by the authors in  FedAvg is more likely to address the challenge of heterogeneity with fewer local epochs, although it results in a higher communication cost. In contrast, our method effectively addresses heterogeneity, enhancing results even with a high number of local epochs, ultimately reducing the required communication overhead.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Discussion and Future Work</h2>

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed method, the server has to train a generator per client. In the case of a Cross-silo setting, in which clients are, for instance, companies, and the number of clients is not very large, this approach is feasible. In cross-device settings, with a large number of small clients, however, this approach requires reconsideration due to the significant burden it places on the server. Therefore, in future research, we plan to enhance our method by extending it to clustered FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In clustered FL, clients are organized into groups based on their similarities. Subsequently, a global model is trained for each cluster. Typically, clients with similar characteristics are grouped together to mitigate the potential adverse effects of heterogeneity among clients. The literature suggests various criteria for determining these similarities.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regardless of the similarity metric chosen, grouping clients in clustered FL can restrict the flow of information between certain clients, leading to potential information loss. To address this limitation and extend the scope of this paper, the proposed future approach involves constructing a generator for each cluster; alternatively, a conditional generator conditioned on different clusters. These generators are designed to incorporate information from other clusters into each specific cluster, mitigating the risk of information loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve this, the design of the similarity metric should align with the generator. Consequently, the clustering similarity metric, when employing FedGenP, can focus on the similarity between gradient directions, given the significance of gradient directions for the generator. The clients with the same gradient direction should be grouped.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider heterogeneous federated learning, where heterogeneity is not only due to imbalanced classes but also to the distribution of samples over the input space. For this reason, we examined the problem from the domain adaptation perspective and focused on minimizing the conflict between the clients’ models. We theoretically show that the performance of the global model on every client is upper bounded by the heterogeneity between that client and the rest. To eliminate heterogeneity, we proposed personalized generative learning in which the server constructs a generator for each client. As a result of this generator, data is generated in the part of the space where the client’s model conflicts with the rest. Thus, combining the original data with generated data will facilitate the clients’ adaptation to global data, thereby enhancing the performance of the global model.</p>
