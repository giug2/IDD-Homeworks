<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This work studies training generative adversarial networks under the federated learning setting. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved advancement in various real-world applications, such as image editing, style transfer, scene generations, etc. However, like other deep learning models, GANs are also suffering from data limitation problems in real cases. To boost the performance of GANs in target tasks, collecting images as many as possible from different sources becomes not only important but also essential. For example, to build a robust and accurate bio-metric verification system, huge amounts of images might be collected from surveillance cameras, and/or uploaded from cellphones by users accepting agreements. In an ideal case, utilize all those data uploaded from public and private devices for model training is straightforward. Unfortunately, in the real scenarios, this is hard due to a few reasons. At first, some data face the serious concern of leakage, and therefore it is prohibitive to upload them to a third-party server for model training; at second, the images collected by different kinds of devices, probably have distinctive biases due to various factors, <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, collector preferences, geo-location differences, which is also known as “domain shift”. To handle those problems, we propose a novel generative learning scheme utilizing a federated learning framework. Following the configuration of federated learning, we conduct model training and aggregation on one center and a group of clients. Specifically, our method learns the distributed generative models in clients, while the models trained in each client are fused into one unified and versatile model in the center. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on touching GAN training under a federated learning setting. We perform extensive experiments to compare different federation strategies, and empirically examine the effectiveness of federation under different levels of parallelism and data skewness.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional machine learning methods require to gather training data into a central database and perform centralized training. However, as there are more and more edge devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, sensors, and cameras connecting to the World Wide Web, the data for training a model might be spread on various equipment. Due to privacy concerns, it might not be possible to upload all the data needed to a central node through public communications. How to safely access data on these heterogeneous devices to effectively train models has become an open research problem. To this end,
federated learning has become a rapidly developing topic in the research community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, as it provides a new way of learning models over a collection of highly distributed devices while still preserving data privacy and communication efficiency.
Federated learning has witnessed many successful applications in distributed use cases such as smartphone keyboard input prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, health monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning has been applied successfully on discriminative model learning, how to apply it to generative learning is still under exploration. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is one typical type of generative models which aims to gain generative capabilities based on game theory and deep learning techniques. Under the traditional machine learning framework, GANs have achieved huge successes in various applications such as realistic images/videos generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, face editing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and style transferring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Though many efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> have been made in boosting the performance of classification tasks with federated learning, there is little work of assessing whether existing federated learning framework works on generative learning or not. In real scenarios, we observe that data for generative learning are distributed among various equipment, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, hand-written digits and signatures are stored in thousands of millions of mobile devices, facial images are stored in edge devices and IoT participants, etc. And therefore, it becomes urgent and necessary to understand whether the federated learning scheme is suitable for learning GANs.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider distributed GAN training on one center and a group of clients with the common communication-efficient federated learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Commonly, each client device possesses its local data with (usually) biased data distribution. E.g., personal devices are mostly used to take portraits, while surveillance cameras are often used to monitor street views. <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">We aim to train a unified central GAN model with the combined generative capacities of each client model.</span> Yet we prohibit transferring any client data to the center as the communications between clients are costly and unsafe. In the following sections, we will (1) investigate four types of synchronization strategies that arise naturally for federated GAN training, (2) briefly introduce the conditional GAN models’ objective functions and architectures, and (3) summarize our proposed algorithm.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> is a widely used federated learning framework that fuses client models to a central model by averaging the model weights. With FedAvg, the central model should be synchronized back (<span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">downloaded</span>) to clients periodically for training on local data, and after certain iterations, the clients <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">upload</span> their local models to the central server for fusing into a new global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our study, however, training federated GANs is more complicated, as two parameter sets for generator (G) and discriminator (D) have to be communicated between the center and clients. This communication mechanism does not exist in a non-federated learning setting, while it is essential in a federated learning setting. How to guarantee an effective and efficient synchronization across the clients and the server becomes an open question.
We propose four types of synchronization strategies during communications. <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sync D&amp;G</span> synchronizes both the central model of D and G to each client. <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sync G</span> synchronizes central G model to each client. <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sync D</span> synchronizes central D model to each client. <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sync None</span> synchronizes neither G nor D from the center to clients.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In our paper, one important mission is to analyze how data distribution affects GAN training in a federated setting. Therefore, we will study conditional GANs (cGANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which can manipulate the class distribution of generated images, e.g., generate ”horse” images given the horse label. We will simulate different class distributions in clients’ training data. Then we will
evaluate the training status of cGANs and analyze the robustness against skewed data distributions.</p>

For hand-written digit generation, the given labels indicate the digits from 0 to 9 to be generated. For the task of natural image generation, the provided labels indicate the image classes, e.g., on CIFAR-10, the classes are plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. D takes an image and its conditional label to predict whether it is real or fake. The conditional label is expanded to image size and attached along image channels.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We summarize our algorithm of <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated GAN learning</span> as follows. At each communication round, a subset of clients is randomly selected. Each client in the subset trains an updated model of GAN with Eq. (<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3.2 Conditional GAN (cGAN) model ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) and (<a href="#S3.E3" title="In 3.2 Conditional GAN (cGAN) model ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) based on their local data. After an epoch of training, the updated parameters of G and D are sent to the server via network communications. The server aggregates client models by weight averaging (or other model fusion techniques) to construct an improved central model. Finally, according to the chosen synchronization strategy mentioned in Section. <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Synchronization strategies ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, each client pulls back the global model to reconstruct their local model. Each client then performs the next round of local model training. The above steps are repeated until convergence or some stopping criteria are met. The details of the algorithm are shown in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 3.3 Algorithm outline ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we show samples of digits generated by GANs trained with different synchronization strategies, which are illustrated in Section. <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Synchronization strategies ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. Specifically, in the federating step, a sampled collection of clients upload their Gs and Ds to the center. The center fuses their weights to form central model G and D with FedAvg or any other federated learning framework. As a quick reminder, strategy (a) Sync D &amp; G will synchronize both central D and G model to each client, (b) Sync G will synchronize central G model back to each client, (c) Sync D will synchronize central D model to each client, (d) synchronize neither central D or G to any client. Obviously, strategy (a) and (b) are visually better than (c) and (d), while (a) and (b) are comparable in image qualities. In Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Visualization ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we show samples of images generated for CIFAR-10 classes with strategy Sync D &amp; G and Sync G. We again found that these two strategies are comparable in visual quality. Curiously, the overall image quality is not as great as the generated digits in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. This is because of less training samples in CIFAR-10, and more complex patterns in natural images. However, how to improve GAN training with more data or with more capable neural network architecture is out of the scope of this paper. We will focus on how federated learning settings affect GAN training in the rest of the paper.</p>

In practice, we trained classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10, which yield a 99.6% and 90% accuracy on testing sets, respectively. We utilize the classifier as an oracle and apply it to generated samples to provide pseudo ground truth labels.
Then we compare the pseudo ground truth labels with the conditional labels which are used to generate those images. The consensus between ground truth labels and conditional labels are taken as classification scores.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Result of different training strategies on IID data ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Generative Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b), we show training results on CIFAR-10 dataset and observe a similar trend: Sync D&amp;G significantly outperforms other methods. Sync G comes the second but is still much better than Sync D and Sync None.
A question arises naturally: why is Sync D performing worse than Sync G? Our explanation is that by synchronizing central D across clients, the discriminative capacity of each client model grows rapidly. Unless we also synchronize G (as Sync D&amp;G does), the capacity of D exceeds G and thus rejects more samples of generated images. This harms and even stops the learning of G. Similar observation has also been reported by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in which they found the generator stops training if discriminator reaches optimum too early. Sync D &amp; G or Sync G would avoid this pitfall. In another aspect, by synchronizing G instead of both G and D, the communication costs could be reduced by about half in both upload and download streams. The trade-off between reducing communication costs and increasing training qualities should be considered case-by-case.
<span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">For real-world applications when communication costs are essentially high, such as edge devices, we recommend to synchronize G to reduce costs while sacrifice some generative capacity. Otherwise, we recommend to synchronize both D and G</span>. In the following experiments, we will synchronize both D and G at default unless otherwise stated.</p>

This accuracy drop can be explained by the weight divergence theory proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> such that more clients lead to faster divergence of model weights with non-IID training data.
We would like to encourage researchers to tackle the problem of federated learning of GANs with non-IID data in future.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a comprehensive study of training GAN with different federation strategies, and found that synchronizing both discriminator and generator across the clients yield the best results in two different tasks. We also observed empirical results that federate learning is generally robust to the number of clients with IID and moderately non-IID training data. However, for highly skewed data distribution, the existing federated learning scheme such as <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> is performing anomaly due to weight divergence.
Future work could further improve GAN training by studying more effective and robust model fusion methods, especially for highly skewed data distribution.</p>
