<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that enables collaboratively learning a shared model across massive clients while keeping the training data locally. However, for many existing FL systems, clients need to frequently exchange model parameters of large data size with the remote cloud server directly via wide-area networks (WAN), leading to significant communication overhead and long transmission time. To mitigate the communication bottleneck, we resort to the hierarchical federated learning paradigm of HiFL, which reaps the benefits of mobile edge computing and combines synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation together to greatly reduce the traffic volumes of WAN transmissions. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence bound of HiFL theoretically and identify the key controllable factors for model performance improvement. We then advocate an enhanced design of HiFlash by innovatively integrating deep reinforcement learning based adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association strategy to boost the system efficiency and mitigate the staleness effect without compromising model accuracy. Extensive experiments corroborate the superior performance of HiFlash in model accuracy, communication reduction, and system efficiency.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, federated learning (FL) has gained growing attention as it collaboratively trains a global machine learning (ML) model in distributed manner without exposing the data from private clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. During the training procedure of FL, the (local/global) model updates are iteratively exchanged between clients and the cloud server until reaching a desirable accurate model, thus it achieves a privacy-preserving learning by leaving training data on local clients. Various popular AI applications such as computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> have been derived within this framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For many existing FL systems, regardless of synchronous update (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and its variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>) or asynchronous update (e.g., FedAsync <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>), massive model parameters need to be exchanged in multiple update iterations. However, clients geographically scattered over the edges of networks are usually connected to a remote cloud server through wide-area networks (WAN) and long-distance transmissions, which would incur high communication cost and serious network congestion. Such communication inefficiency would greatly deteriorate the system performance of large-scale distributed training and further hinder the wide deployment of FL systems in practice. Hence, the research issue of boosting the communication efficiency of FL has recently drawn great attention<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical architecture is a promising solution to alleviate the huge communication pressure of the cloud server, since an order of magnitude fewer data-size of model update would be transferred to cloud by aggregating local models at the lower layer in advance. Due to the merits of mobile edge computing (MEC) in practice, edge nodes (e.g., 5G edge servers) can be set as the intermediates for local model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The rationales are as follows: 1) due to shorter routing path and less hop distance in the local-area network (LAN), a lower network delay and reduced network jitter are offered in the edge layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Further, the straggler problem caused by less effective communication between cloud and clients can be significantly alleviated; 2) compared to high monetary cost of WAN usage in traditional FL, abundant cheaper LAN resources at the edge nodes promote FL deployment in reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>; 3) FL applications are commonly scattered over massive devices, which are naturally clustered into many edge domains (e.g., campus and hospital) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This distributed pattern can be well accommodated in hierarchical FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by these facts, a new paradigm of client-edge-cloud hierarchical FL has recently been put forward <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which involves two levels of synchronous model aggregations, i.e., client model aggregation controlled by the edge nodes at lower layer, edge model aggregation controlled by the cloud server at higher layer. This framework aims at leveraging the advantage of synchronous update to train global model with high accuracy and fast convergence at the lower layer, benefited from high LAN bandwidth and sufficient computation resources at the edge nodes. However, a severe straggler problem at the higher layer would be incurred due to the edge heterogeneity (e.g., diverse WAN connection conditions and heterogeneous edge aggregation time due to different client size) and the communication bottleneck from edge to cloud. More explicitly, large waiting time in synchronous global model aggregation at the higher layer is inevitable.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fully unleash the benefits of hierarchical FL, in this paper we incorporates the merits of synchronous and asynchronous operations in different aggregation layers into the hierarchical FL, which we call HiFL in order to differentiate it from HierFAVG, the version of hierarchical FL with two levels of synchronous model aggregations. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, confronted with huge edge heterogeneity and complicated WAN environment among edge nodes and cloud, asynchronous update is adopted for edge-cloud model aggregation to improve learning efficiency via wait-free communication. At the lower layer, synchronous model aggregation between clients and edge nodes ensures high accuracy and fast convergence. Moreover, benefited from high LAN bandwidth and sufficient computation resources at the edges in the communication-efficient one-hop access edge network environment, the straggler problem is very mild and can be neglected during synchronous client-edge aggregation, compared with the asynchronous edge-cloud aggregation communications over the latency-significant WAN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, HiFL also brings in new challenges on account of the asynchronous aggregation and hierarchical mechanism design. On one hand, staleness effect arised in asynchronous update negatively impacts on the model accuracy and convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Existing staleness-tolerant mechanisms usually dampen the impacts of stale model updates by only controlling the trade-off between convergence rate and variance reduction according to the staleness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, its impact on system efficiency (e.g., training time, resource efficiency) is much less considered. For example, a model with large staleness may marginally contribute to the global model, which results in more rounds of communication to reach a target accuracy for asynchronous FL. Thus, it is critical to control the model staleness for communication-efficient model learning. On the other hand, the hierarchical mechanism introduces data heterogeneity among edges, which can be further amplified by the hierarchical client-edge-cloud model aggregation and lead to degraded model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Besides, the resource heterogeneity among the edge-associated clients can exacerbate the straggler effects, possibly prolonging the waiting time in client-edge model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with the above challenges, in this paper we first investigate HiFL to gain useful theoretical insights about its performance bound and system efficiency, and then identify the key controllable parameters that affect the learning performance. Motivated by our theoretical results, we devise an adaptive staleness control strategy for edge-cloud layer and a heterogeneity-aware association mechanism for client-edge layer to improve the overall efficiency of HiFL. For staleness control, existing approaches usually assume a pre-defined fixed threshold for the participating clients, which can not well adapt to the realistic dynamic environment. Moreover, the threshold determination is non-trivial due to the complicated FL environments (e.g., data and resource heterogeneity of clients, current running stages of FL model). Differently, we resort to the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method and design a DRL agent based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> to wisely make adaptive staleness threshold decisions tailored to the dynamic and complicated FL environments. The DRL agent is trained through a Double DQN for increased efficiency and robustness. For client-edge association, we devise an efficient weighted heuristic to find a near optimal solution that jointly minimizes the data heterogeneity among the edges and resource heterogeneity in the edge-associated clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the disparate behaviors of cloud and edges, HiFL adopts synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation to synergistically train a high-quality ML model in a cost-efficient way. At the side of edge, high LAN bandwidth and reduced network jitter considerably shorten the communication latency for gradient exchanges or model download. Within the same LAN environment, synchronous model aggregation is more desired between edge nodes and clients, due to its high model training precision and fast convergence speed. However, at the side of cloud, model training suffers from communication bottleneck in the complicated WAN environment (e.g., highly fluctuating long-distance transmission time and diverse edge model aggregation time due to different size of clients with different edges), which leads to severe straggler problem. Thus, asynchronous aggregation is adopted to mitigate this straggler effect via reducing the waiting time of model updates between the central server and the edge nodes.</p>

More explicitly, once an idle edge node gets engaged in model training for its interest, it will actively inform the cloud server to download the latest version of global model. Then the cloud server will check its updater and immediately send the result to corresponding edge node. Receiving the global model, the edge node quickly broadcasts it to the associated clients and leverages their local datasets to collaboratively train a shared edge model in a synchronous manner with efficient client-edge communication. If the cloud server receives a trained model from an edge node, the updater will update the global model immediately, without waiting for other edge nodes. In order to control the model staleness caused by asynchronous aggregation, the updater conducts model aggregation with a weight penalty on the received model update, which will be elaborated in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 HiFL Training Process ‣ 3 HiFL Design ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>.</p>

This asynchronous model aggregation strategy relieves the network congestion on the cloud side and enables wait-free global model learning, further reducing the communication overhead and speeding up the model training process. Particularly, different counters are set to record the model update times in this hierarchical settings, since the clients update the edge model without the coordination of the cloud server.

Each client owns samples from only one single class in MNIST dataset. Edge-IID means that the clients are clustered into different edge groups and the data distributions on the edge nodes are IID (e.g., identical number of samples from 10 classes). While in Edge-NonIID case, the samples maintained by an edge node are from 5 classes. Edge-IID association strategy groups the clients with a smaller edge-cloud model divergence, and ultimately leads to fast convergence and high accuracy. Therefore, given the clients with Non-IID distributions, a heterogeneity-aware client-edge association strategy is desired to make the data distributions on the edge nodes similar to the global IID distribution.</p>

Specifically, we formulate the system cost model and then adopt a deep reinforcement learning approach to dynamically control the staleness threshold.</p>

For example, we can assign higher weights to resource cost so that smaller staleness threshold are prefer to be chosen in fear of severe staleness effect and resource waste. While smaller weights of resource cost indicates that training time is critical for a FL training task and more decisions with bigger staleness threshold are made to facilitate more parallel model training.</p>

Considering the continuous and high-dimensional space and the limited available traces from FL tasks, we adopt DQN as the DRL agent to efficiently learn the optimal staleness control policy. Due to the complicated dynamics in FL system, overestimation issue can easily arise due to insufficient exploration by DQN. Hence, to solve the overestimation problem, we propose to use Double Deep Q-learning (DDQN) to learn the approximator <math id="S5.SS2.p10.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math"

Due to the synchronous mechanism, the edge model aggregation can be conducted until the associated slowest client uploads its newly-updated model. Hence, the resource heterogeneity (e.g., response latency) among the clients should also be taken into consideration. We strike a nice balance between data heterogeneity of edges and resource heterogeneity inherent in clients to establish a heterogeneity-aware client-edge association mechanism for fast and accurate cloud model learning.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">For a more intuitive illustration, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.3 Heterogeneity-aware Association at Client-Edge Layer ‣ 5 HiFlash: HiFL with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, after adding client 1 and client 2 into the client cluster of edge 1, it is better to choose client 4, rather than client 3, in order to make the data distribution of edge 1 close to the IID distribution. Similarly to many existing studies such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we consider that the clients are stationary or their locations change slowly during FL training process. This can be mainly motivated by that since FL requires intensive computing and frequent communication, most clients would like to participate FL when they are in stable conditions (e.g., when charging their batteries at home/office) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For the case that clients’ locations change fast, we can apply the adaptive client-edge association strategies to periodically update the clients’ edge node selections. And some online optimization algorithms can be further leveraged to improve the performance of dynamic client-edge associations. Nevertheless, the theoretical analysis of such case is much more involved, and will be considered as a future work due to space limit.</p>

HiFlash can be seen as an enhanced HiFL approach equipped with adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association, hence we can choose either HiFL or HiFlash for efficient FL model training. In HiFlash, adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association are designed to alleviate the staleness issue in asynchronous aggregation at the cloud server and data heterogeneity among the edges, respectively. As a result, it is possible to combine each of these two parts with existing works with asynchronous FL for performance enhancement, by following the similar ideas developed in our paper.</p>

Hence, according to different action size, the DDQN model in the DRL agent, which is implemented by two two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, has 4,607 and 4,235 trainable parameters for MNIST (and FEMNIST), and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively. The output of the MLP network passing through a softmax layer becomes the probability of selecting a staleness threshold.

Considering the fact that hierarchical FL executes more local computations in one global round to reduce the costly communication with the cloud, we propose to evaluate the test accuracy with respect to the total number of training epochs on clients. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, we investigate the model accuracy and computation efficiency of different training methods under three kinds of data heterogeneity for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively. As the centralized training method collects all the data to the cloud for model learning, it does not incur any computation cost on devices. Hence, we only use the test accuracy of centralized learning to provide an upper bound of model accuracy for other comparing methods.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We can see that by incorporating the merits of synchronous and asynchronous model aggregation and dampening the negative effect of model staleness, HiFL and HiFlash can achieve comparable training performance with FedAvg method in IID cases. For Non-IID cases, HiFL and HiFlash perform slightly less well than FedAvg when comparing test accuracy with respect to total number of training epochs on clients. This is because that the multiple rounds of client-edge aggregation in HiFL and HiFlash might lead to some degree of gradient divergence, and hence degrade the model performance. Moreover, as HiFL and HiFlash are designed with asynchronous model aggregation, they inevitably suffer from staleness effect, comparing with FedAvg.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">HiFL and HiFlash perform better than other hierarchical FL methods (e.g., HierFAVG). Since hierarchical FL is designed to reduce the costly communication at the price of more local computations, HierFAVG, the extension of FedAvg in the hierarchical setting, is computationally inefficient comparing with FedAvg as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. This is because that HierFAVG performs fewer edge-cloud aggregations than FedAvg for the same amount of local training epochs. While with the asynchronous update mechanism which well balances the global model and the uploaded edge model in HiFL and HiFlash, we can see that the performance gap between HiFL and FedAvg narrows significantly, comparing with that between HierFAVG and FedAvg, indicating that the asynchronous aggregation in HiFL and HiFlash is more computationally efficient than other hierarchical FL schemes.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">HiFL and HiFlash perform better than other synchronous or asynchronous based methods. For example, asynchronous FL methods (e.g., FedAsync and FedAT) have lower test accuracy than HiFL and HiFlash, since they ignore the negative impacts of biased data distribution and model staleness on the cloud model accuracy. The sharp oscillation in the curves of FedAsync algorithm attributes to the following two reasons: (1) the global model in FedAsync algorithm is updated once one client uploads its updated model without waiting for stragglers. This kind of asynchronous aggregation induces much uncertainty into the performance of the resulting global model, especially in Non-IID cases. While other algorithms fuse different client models to ensure the generalization ability of the global model; and (2) the staleness effect makes the convergence of FedAsync slower and causes the performance instability when facing large staleness.</p>

Specifically, HiFlash significantly reduces the communication cost (e.g., <math id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="87\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">87</mn><mo id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1.1.2">87</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p13.1.m1.1c">87\%</annotation></semantics></math> than FedAvg) with a slight model accuracy degradation (e.g., <math id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2.1\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">2.1</mn><mo id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1.1.2">2.1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p13.2.m2.1c">2.1\%</annotation></semantics></math>).

Furthermore, the superiority of HiFlash can be amplified as data heterogeneity increases (see Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.2 Metrics and Baselines ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>).</p>

As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F18" title="Figure 18 ‣ 6.3 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>, the DRL agent for adaptive staleness control improves the staleness threshold decision policy unremittingly as it interacts with the FL environment and learns from the DRL training episodes. We adopt boxplot to graphically depict the five-number summary of the distribution of the staleness threshold decisions in different training episodes, which consists of the smallest observation, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and largest observation. The upper quartile, median and lower quartile make up a box with compartments. The spacings between different parts indicate the variance and skew in the data distribution and the mean of staleness thresholds in shown with the green triangles. The decision policy in episode 0 is the random staleness control policy adopted in HiFL while the improved policy in episode 150 is utilized by the HiFlash approach. We can learn from the skewed data distribution that more decisions made in HiFlash choose a smaller staleness threshold compared with random decision policy, resulting in communication-efficient model training.</p>

While the lower system cost of HiFlash is credited to the effectiveness of our adaptive staleness control strategy design. It is worthnoting that although the DQN training in HiFlash brings additional computation overhead, it can be conducted on the cloud server with sufficient computation resources in an offline manner.</p>

Thus, the average response latency may be longer due to the trade-off between data heterogeneity and latency reduction.

An gradient correction term is designed to compensate the staleness in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, these approaches only focus on the negative impact of staleness on model accuracy and convergence speed. The system efficiency, such as computation/communication cost, and training time, is less considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A stale model may marginally contribute to the global model, but cause large resource waste and time consumption without timely terminating model training and uploading.
To address this issue, FedSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, a staleness-aware asynchronous FL algorithm sets a staleness threshold for each participating client based on its computing speed. However, this approach ignores the communication cost and the training time in the whole process. Besides, the staleness threshold in FedSA is fixed for each client, which can not well adapt to the realistic dynamic environment. Zhang et al. propose a clustered semi-asynchronous federated learning (CSAFL) approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, which alleviates the model staleness problem by dividing clients with different learning objectives into multiple groups and limiting the model delay. However, CSAFL aims to learn personalized models, i.e., different group models for different client groups, while the HiFlash approach has a different goal and aims to learn a common global model that merits the commonality of the global knowledge sharing based on all the local data generated on clients.</p>

<div id="S7.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The client-edge association strategy in hierarchical FL has a significant impact on model learning performance due to the data and resource heterogeneity across the dispersed clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. HierFAVG ignores the varying training speed of the distributed clients and randomly groups them into different clusters, which may prolong the communication time of each training round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Considering the straggler effect, both TiFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> and FedAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> divide the clients into different tiers based on the measured latency so that the resource heterogeneity can be mitigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. To tackle the data heterogeneity in FL, Duan et al. propose FedGroup, which clusters clients into multiple groups based on the cosine similarity of their parameter updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. In FedCluster, the authors provide several representative clustering approaches, including random uniform clustering, timezone-based clustering and availability-based clustering, to support for various application scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, current client-edge association schemes only focus on one dimension of heterogeneity, without considering the trade-off between data and resource heterogeneities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing convergence analysis of hierarchical FL schemes mainly focus on FL with two levels of synchronous model aggregations. For example, the convergence of HierFAVG measures two-level of non-IIDness (i.e., the client level and the edge level) for data distribution in the hierarchical system, and provides qualitative guidelines on picking the aggregation frequencies at two levels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. While the theoretical analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> further proves that reducing the non-IIDness at the edge level is important for the model convergence. Although FedAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is designed with synchronous client-edge aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud aggregation, the asynchronous aggregation mechanism in FedAT is a weighted sum of all the latest edge models, which is different from our asynchronous update mechanism. Moreover, the convergence analysis of FedAT ignores the staleness effect and hence fails to provide insights for staleness effect alleviation. Nevertheless, our convergence analysis for HiFL considers both staleness introduced by asynchronous model aggregation and non-IIDness inherent in FL, and further draws some insights for staleness control and non-IIDness reduction to achieve a fast convergence rate and a low convergence bound.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we resort to HiFL, a hierarchical FL approach that synergistically employs synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation for communication-efficient model learning. Based on the convergence analysis of HiFL, we identify the controllable factors for model convergence and further advocate HiFlash, an enhanced HiFL with adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association, for large-scale deployment in reality. We propose a DRL-based staleness threshold decision algorithm for accurate and cost-efficient FL model learning. To tackle the inherent resource and data heterogeneity among clients, we design a heterogeneity-aware client-edge association strategy that strikes a nice balance between communication latency and the heterogeneity of edge data distributions. Our empirical evaluation based on three image classification datasets validates our theoretical analysis, and demonstrates that HiFlash achieves satisfactory prediction performance for different levels of data heterogeneity and is communication-efficient compared with existing FL methods.</p>
