<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">The increasing concerns about data privacy and security drive an emerging field of studying privacy-preserving machine learning from isolated data sources, i.e., <span id="id12.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span>.
A class of federated learning, <span id="id12.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vertical federated learning</span>, where different parties hold different features for common users, has a great potential of driving a great variety of business cooperation among enterprises in many fields. In machine learning, decision tree ensembles such as gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and random forest are widely applied powerful models with high interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, state-of-art vertical federated learning frameworks adapt anonymous features to avoid possible data breaches, makes the interpretability of the model compromised.</p>
<p id="id13.id2" class="ltx_p">To address this issue in the inference process, in this paper, we firstly make a problem analysis about the necessity of disclosure meanings of feature to Guest Party in vertical federated learning. Then we find the prediction result of a tree could be expressed as the intersection of results of sub-models of the tree held by all parties. With this key observation, we protect data privacy and allow the disclosure of feature meaning by concealing decision paths and adapt a communication-efficient secure computation method for inference outputs. The advantages of Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical results. We improve the interpretability of the model by disclosing the meaning of features while ensuring efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data in the real world widely exist in isolated islands, which becomes a fundamental limiting factor for AI modeling and data analytics. For example, personal credit assessing in data-driven risk management usually uses three types of data: qualification data, credit data, consumption data, often held by different enterprises and institutions. The security and privacy of data are increasingly concerned in recent years. Typically, operators have enacted laws and regulations to protect the privacy of users’ data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> by European Union and California Consumer Privacy Act by California, United States. Moreover, the data assets are highly valued, making data owners often reluctant to reveal their data to others. It drives the emergence of a novel field, termed as <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, studying privacy-preserving distributed machine learning from multiple data sources without sharing original data.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Backgrounds and Related Work.</span> According to the structure of sample space and feature space across data sources, federated learning can be categorized into three classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, i.e., horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. Horizontal federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> refers to the scenarios where each participating party holds a subset of all data samples with common feature space. Vertical federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> studies collaborative machine learning where different parties share the same sample space but differ in feature space. Federated transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> usually explores the area where different parties differ both in sample space and feature space. Among these structures, vertical federated learning is a promising approach to bridge the gap between isolated data providers for business cooperations and beyond the limits of locally available data to AI systems. There are a line of works studying the vertical federated learning of linear/logistic regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, random forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, kernel methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Decision tree, especially decision tree ensemble models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> including random forest and GBDT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, are an important class of machine learning models due to their powerful generalization capability, high modeling efficiency, and better interpretability. Federated learning of decision tree models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> has garnered numerous attention recently. The works of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> focused on improving the efficiency of GBDT model training of horizontal federated learning. SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> first proposed a vertical federated learning framework to build GBDT model, whose security is guaranteed via encrypting the exchanged intermediate values with homomorphic encryption (HE). SecureGBM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed to extend the efficient GBDT framework LightGBM to vertical federated learning, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a federated random forest framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although vertical federated decision tree ensemble models have been widely applied in many fields, unfortunately, we observe that the inference of existing works such as SecureBoost and secureGBM severely compromise the interpretability of the model due to anonymous features. In these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the commonly used multi-interactive (MI) inference procedure makes decision path of Host parties (i.e., data providers) known to the Guest party (i.e., the model user), which brings possible data breaches of Host with disclosed feature meaning. The federated learning models without explicit feature meanings are not interpretable in business applications. Both GDPR in EU and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> in US grant users the ”right to explanation”. A new financial industry standard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> recently released by the People’s Bank of China specifies the interpretable requirement for features used in the AI algorithms for financial applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our Work.</span> The state-of-art vertical decision tree ensembles adapt a MI(multi-interactive) inference with the anonymous feature for possible data breaches. In financial applications, since the model’s interpretability is critical for the user, we focus on improving the interpretability of the vertical decision tree ensembles. To address the issue, we shall propose Fed-EINI, a secure and interpretable inference framework allowing to disclose feature meanings of Host parties to the Guest party. We observe that possible data breaches of existing works result from unprotected decision paths, which motivates the adoption of HE to compute the inference result with encrypted decision paths securely. To improve the communication efficiency and achieve low-latency inference, we calculate, encode and encrypt candidate decision paths locally at each party to make the decision path indistinguishable by other parties. The inference result is then obtained via secure aggregation with only one round of encrypted information exchange. We improve the interpretability of the model by disclosing the meaning of features while ensuring efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, we explained the necessity of feature disclosure from the perspective of industry compliance and model users, which is the bottleneck in the application of vertical federated learning in the financial field. The existing works, such as SecureBoost, do not disclose the meaning of the features for data privacy. In Fed-EINI we proposed, based on a key observation, the Host party discloses the meaning of features to the Guest party for interpretability and encrypts the decision path for data privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, in terms of security, we compared the information available to each party in Fed-EINI with the existing vertical federated decision tree ensembles. Our method allows the disclosure of the meanings of features held by passive parties to the Guest while hiding the splitting path information. Therefore, the detailed privacy of each sample will not be leaked to the Guest party, and the splitting path in Fed-EINI is secured by Paillier cryptosystem.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we use theoretical analysis and numerical results conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of Fed-EIN. As the prediction result of a single tree can be expressed losslessly as the intersection of results of the sub-models of the trees held by all parties. Fed-EINI can achieve the same accuracy as the existing method. Due to the adoption of a more efficient communication-efficiency calculation method, we decouple the calculation process between multiple parties, and the encoding process of each party does not depend on the results of other parties. There will be less waiting time and communication rounds between multiple parties. The whole inference time is reduced by more than 38% on the experiment result.</p>

In this framework, the decision path of a decision tree model is determined by sequentially finding the decision on the current node and moving to the next node. Each decision is made by evoking the party which owns the corresponding feature and sending the computation result back to the Guest. If the splitting rule of the node and the feature are owned by the Guest party, the Guest party makes the decision path based on local data. If the node and the feature are owned by others, the Guest party should receive the decision path from the Host party which owns the corresponding feature. The weight on the leaf node reached by the decision path is the decision tree’s prediction value. The MI inference framework admits a serial structure of interactions shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-C Multi-Interactive (MI) Inference ‣ II Preliminaries and Problem Definition ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which means the inference is performed tree by tree. Finally, the Guest party summarizes all the weights for prediction. Note that the features for Host parties should be anonymous to the Guest, and the Guest party has only the index numbers (e.g., <math id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="HF_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">F</mi><mn id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐻</ci><apply id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝐹</ci><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">HF_{1}</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="HF_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">F</mi><mn id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><times id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐻</ci><apply id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">𝐹</ci><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">HF_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>) to avoid possible data breaches.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The pioneering MI inference framework enables a party to make predictions enhanced by external data sources. However, the features for Host parties should be anonymous to Guest and the Guest party has only the index numbers for the MI inference framework in existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Disclosing the meanings of features of Host parties to Guest leads to possible data breaches. For example, if a feature in Host indicates whether a user “is in blacklist”, we know that bad guys usually take only a small portion of all users. Therefore, the splitting direction with fewer samples indicates that the corresponding users are in the blacklist while others are not.</p>

<p id="S2.I2.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the meanings of features are essential to prove the compliance of the model to regulators in financial businesses. For example, consumers should not be discriminated by their gender, age, race, and religion as required by ECOA in US.

<p id="S2.I2.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, industry practitioners need the meanings of features to judge the reasonability of AI models, especially for financial risk management. Since financial risks are usually impossible to be quantified explicitly, financial industry practitioners are often careful in making decisions to avoid potential loss. They usually evaluate AI models with their professional knowledge and experience before use, which requires the meanings of used features. For example, according to The expert experience, people with more stable consumption behavior should have higher credit scores. AI models behaving the opposite way are thought to be unreasonable and unusable for financial industry practitioners.</p>

Therefore, the proposed inference framework is efficient and interpretable, allowing the disclosure of feature meanings of Host parties to Guest. It consists of two stages: parallel calculation stage and synchronization stage. To present the framework concisely, we take a two-party model case as a representative, in which case there are one Guest party and one Host party. It can be easily extended to a multi-party case, which will be demonstrated in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Extension To Multi-party Scenarios ‣ III Fed-EINI: Proposed Two-Stage Framework ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>.</p>

Compared with the MI inference in SecureBoost, the proposed Fed-EINI allows the disclosure of the meanings of features held by passive parties to the Guest while hiding the splitting path information. In the inference process, the disclosure of the splitting path adopted in SecureBoost is privacy-sensitive if the Guest also has the availability to the feature meaning. To address this issue, SecureBoost has proposed to hide the meaning of features held by passive parties, and Guest only knows index numbers of features. Therefore, the Guest knows the split path of each sample but does not know the meaning of the features corresponding to the split path. In the proposed Fed-EINI approach, Guest knows the plain-text feature meaning of each splitting node without any information about the split directions based on other parties’ data.
We should notice that the splitting path in Fed-EINI is secured by Paillier cryptosystem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which is IND-CCA2 secure in the random oracle model.</p>

It can be seen that Fed-EINI provides both the meanings of features and their importance, which is more interpretable and applicable. In real applications, features held by a party could be already known by other parties due to business dealings in the past. In this case, the approach of anonymizing features in MI inference can still lead to data breaches, while Fed-EINI provides better protection for data privacy. Therefore, Fed-EINI is a more secure and interpretable framework for business use.</p>

For the MI inference framework, the split direction of a node is decided only after its parent node has been visited. With this sequential structure, each party has to wait for the completion of another party to perform local inference. Our proposed inference algorithm decouples the interaction process between multiple parties, and each party generates all the candidates in parallel based on its local splitting condition and local data.</p>

On the JDT data set, the average time consumed by our encoding method only accounts for 49% of the time consumed by GBDT, and in the worst case, this ratio is only 63.4%. We guess that this is due to the imbalance in the division of the JDT data set. Guest holds five features, while Host has 108 features.

We set the maximum tree depth as 4, and vary the instance number in {10000, 20000, 40000, 80000} and the feature number in {10, 25, 113}, and the tree number in {10, 20, 100}. We compare the cost time of the whole inference process to investigate how each variant affects the efficiency. First of all, the Fed-EINI we proposed has significantly less time-consuming than the SecureBoost in each case. In addition, as Figure <a href="#S5.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ V-C Accuracy Results ‣ V Experiment and Results ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8a</span></a> shows, the inference time increases almost linearly with the instance number. There are similar observations on both Figure <a href="#S5.F8.sf2" title="In Figure 8 ‣ V-C Accuracy Results ‣ V Experiment and Results ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8b</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S5.F8.sf3" title="In Figure 8 ‣ V-C Accuracy Results ‣ V Experiment and Results ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8c</span></a>. Besides, we observe that although the number of features increases, the time consumption increase slowly. As the number of features increases, extra features contribute less to the model, so the increasing time consumption for inference is small. Besides, as Figure <a href="#S5.F8.sf3" title="In Figure 8 ‣ V-C Accuracy Results ‣ V Experiment and Results ‣ Fed-EINI: An Efficient and Interpretable Inference Framework for Decision Tree Ensembles in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8c</span></a> shows, when the tree size is equal to 10, due to the small number of trees, the improvement is not as significant as the case of tree=100. The efficiency of Fed-EINI we proposed will be stable when there are more decision trees.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the inference problem for vertical federated decision tree ensemble models. To address the lack of interpretability, we proposed Fed-EINI to encrypt decision paths to make it secure to disclose feature meanings to the Guest party, namely the model user party. To reduce the high costs resulted from encryption operations and ciphertext exchanges, we proposed an efficient two-stage framework including parallel calculation stage and synchronization stage. It adopted efficient additively homomorphic encryption and parallel calculation to improve computation efficiency and required only one round of information exchange to improve communication efficiency.
Since the decision path is invisible to any party, Fed-EINI provides a more secure and interpretable inference framework than existing works for vertical federated decision tree ensemble models. Experimental results demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of Fed-EINI compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>
