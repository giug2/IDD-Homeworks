<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">IoT/ IIoT devices’ data may be considered highly private; as such, training machine learning models to help detect intrusions in the network of those devices requires so much attention. In a connection of many IoT devices that each collect data, normally training a machine learning model would involve transmitting the data to a central server which requires strict privacy rules. However, some owners are reluctant of availing their data out of the company due to data security concerns.</p>
<p id="id8.id2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning(FL) as a distributed machine learning approach performs training of a machine learning model on the device that gathered the data itself. In this scenario, data is not share over the network for training purpose. Fedavg as one of FL algorithms permits a model to be copied to participating devices during a training session. The devices could be chosen at random, and a device can be aborted. The resulting models are sent to the coordinating server and then average models from the devices that finished training. The process is repeated until a desired model accuracy is achieved. By doing this, FL approach solves the privacy problem for IoT/ IIoT devices that held sensitive data for the owners. In this paper, we leverage the benefits of FL and implemented Fedavg algorithm on a recent dataset that represent the modern IoT/ IIoT device networks. The results were almost the same as the centralized machine learning approach. We also evaluated some shortcomings of Fedavg such as unfairness that happens during the training when struggling devices do not participate for every stage of training. This inefficient training of local or global model could lead in a high number of false alarms in intrusion detection systems for IoT/IIoT gadgets developed using Fedavg. Hence, after evaluating the FedAv deep auto encoder with centralized deep auto encoder ML, we further proposed and designed a Fair Fedavg algorithm that will be evaluated in the future work.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">IoT edge devices have found their ways into every corner of humans’ lives. They are very popular and have become essential in our daily lives both individually and on the industrial level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Despite their wide adoption in many sectors such as healthcare for smart healthcare surveillance of patients , smart homes, educational and industrial environments, they are possible vectors of malicious attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In nature, these devices are interconnected to collect and exchange sensitive data of owners. In fact, it is predicted that by 2025 the amount of data produced by IoT devices will be 79.4 zettabytes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the number of the interconnect devices grows on the network, malware attacks targeting them increases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
In recent years, various modern technologies driven by machine learning have been used for solving complex problems due the rapid development of hardware and heterogeneous devices (including edge and IIoT devices) as well as the widespread deployment of the 6G network that made edge devices gain greater communication and computation capacity for a wider range of applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In this regard, machine learning techniques has gained success in developing intelligent systems for intrusion detection in IoT systems. However, they require a large amount of high-quality data for model training in real-world scenarios for their success <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. To satisfy this requirement, huge amounts of data is required to be sent to the central entity for model training and modeling purpose. Moreover, over recent years, because the implementation of machine learning as well as deep learning-based techniques gained success for developing intelligent systems, they have been adopted for the IoT/ IIoT security field for cyber-attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Those techniques use the data gathered by edge devices to detect behavior changes in the network packets. Once behavior sources are selected and monitored, the next step to achieve a successful malware detection is to process the data and generate device behavior fingerprints. Currently, for malware detection solutions, most of existing ML/DL approaches depend on a central server, which gathers data from various IoT devices, and then trains global models. After this step, produced models are sent to each client that is concerned. In other situations, these devices transmit their live test data to the server for behavior evaluation and malware detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, for situations where IoT device’s behavior include confidential data that would impact the security and privacy of owners when captured by attackers, the data owners might be reluctant to use ML/DL techniques might due to data transmission over the network. Luckily, to ensure data privacy and securing IoT networks, the decentralized ML/DL based anomaly detection models named federated learning have been designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. It facilitates a collective learning of complex models between scattered devices’ data guaranteeing data is not shared with the external entities over the internet. Moreover, FL allows training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Among the researchers that have worked towards addressing the issue of securing IoT network is the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> where, by using a FL autoencoder model combined with multi-layer perceptron to detect malware in IoT devices, they complied with data privacy. They compared the result obtained from detecting malware in IoT devices with a centralized approach. Moreover, they have worked on fighting against adversarial attacks when the dataset is processed at the edge because adversarial attacks may affect federated training in terms of both communication rounds and accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> also propose an Intrusion Detection System based on anomaly detection for IoT. Different security gateways, each monitoring the traffic of one a particular device type, locally train Gated Recurrent Unit model and send it to an IoT security service for aggregation.
Though those FL approaches and others have started to be utilized for anomaly detection, they are addressing the problem of detecting and classifying anomalies in a edge networks on datasets that do not represent the modern IoT/IIoT edge devices. Utilizing new real-world datasets that represent the modern attacks which may resulted from the evolution of IIoT architecture that leads to different novel attacks for training ML/DL even FL model is as important as designing them to be able detected anomalies with higher accuracy and precision.As mentioned above, to comply with data security, the adoption of privacy preserving techniques such as federated learning (FL) for securing billions of vulnerable IoT devices, has started to gain popularity. FL preserves the security for sensitive data held by IoT devices by training a model without transmitting sensitive data over the network. Though, the researchers have been designing and developing decentralized machine learning for anomaly detection in industrial internet of things networks, training these models on the right dataset is a crucial part. Most of those research has been tested on datasets that are not representing modern IoT/IIoT devices, and these devices’ architecture have been growing as the technology advances.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As a result of emerging technologies, new attacks also evolve making it hard to detect attacks that are specific to modern IIoT edge devices with high accuracy. Thus, it is very important to use datasets that closely mirror real-world IoT/IIoT applications. It also is worthy to note that when applying federated learning on IIoT networks, datasets are generated across heterogeneous edge devices and might be unlabeled. To overcome this issue, unsupervised decentralized machine learning is the solution for training models to detect those cyber-threats using unlabeled data. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> have applied the unsupervised federated learning for detecting anomalies in IoT devices without compromising the data privacy, however, they used dataset that does not contain IoT and IIoT traffic. Moreover, other researchers such as Rey et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> applied the unsupervised privacy preserving model training on dataset that contains IoT network flows, but the dataset includes only cyber-attacks from two botnets, and there is no IIoT traffic involvement. Therefore, it is difficult to identify and detect other types of malicious IIoT attacks relevant to IIoT security applications, such as man in the middle. Though the work of the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> has leveraged the benefits of FL on modern IIoT traffic datasets and have achieved a better accuracy, nevertheless, they didn’t consider the unsupervised need of anomaly detection in distributed datasets. Additionally, as most other works related to applying FL for IoT/IIoT security, they used vanilla federated learning, which by default is synchronous and assumes that devices have the same computing power.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Besides data owners being reluctant to avail their data, in recent years, data legislators and regulatory agencies have been putting a lot of effort into making sure that personal data is secured, making data gathering even more difficult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Industries also are reluctant to share their data due to peer competitions, privacy concerns, and other potential concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Moreover, data legislators and regulatory agencies such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have been putting a lot of effort into making sure that personal data is secured. As a result, gathering data from different reliable sources, especially for IoT devices that hold critical data for their owners, is almost impossible if not costly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For this reason, the ML models built by utilizing distributed datasets are the possible solutions. One of this approach is possible by applying Federated learning (FL), which is a novel paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaborate on ML model training without requiring direct data access <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, it is believed that as the edge device architecture evolves, the attacks against modern IoT/IIoT gadgets evolve making the network cyber-attack flow behaviors change leading to high false negatives if the intelligent intrusion detection systems used have been trained and tested on datasets that do not mirror modern attacks. Thus, evaluating FL model have to be performed on modern datasets that reflect modern IIoT attacks in an unsupervised manner as well because labeling traffic for every devices is not possible.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the security issues targeting the IoT devices network, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has been the preferred approach.

IDSs are normally classed into signature-based or anomaly-based approaches. Signature-based IDSs identify intrusions and protect the system by utilizing previously learned rules from known attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs monitor network traffic and compare the traffic with previously learned patterns to spot malicious activities. In comparison, anomaly detection methods have shown to be more effective to recognize known and new attacks but need frequent updates to detect new attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the well known world DDoS attack caused by IoT malware Mirai , which was used to propagate the biggest DDoS attack in 2016, there has been a proliferation of IoT malware attacks following the leakage of its source code. Since then, various research has been done to address the issues. Among those solutions are ML-based and DL-based, which are widely utilized in cyber security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Regarding the computational issue of IoT devices, attempts to build ML light-weighted algorithms that can be used to secure IoT by detecting malicious traffic and nodes have been done. Kumar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a module for detecting the network activity of IoT malware in large-scale networks called EMDA during the scanning /infecting phase rather than during attack. It consists of machine learning (ML) algorithms running at the user access gateway which detect malware activity based on their scanning traffic patterns, a database that stores the malware scanning traffic patterns and can be used to retrieve or update those patterns, and a policy module which decides the further course of action after gateway traffic has been classified as malicious. To reduce the memory space required, the classification is performed on IoT access gateway level traffic rather than device-level traffic as working on aggregate traffic is faster. two classes of gateway-level traffic were classified as benign and malicious using Naive Bayes, k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) and Random Forest algorithms. Though the accuracy was above 88%, it still needs to be improved. In addition to that, there is an added issue of communication latency, and they did not consider the effect of false alarm issues.</p>

The detection module for an IoT controller uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify network traffic. The system was designed in the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) context and evaluated on an emulated platform using three actual and well-known datasets. Variable selection was performed using the Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validated techniques.

It is also capable of detecting malicious network activity in real-time. IOT-KEEPER uses. It uses a combination of fuzzy C-means clustering and fuzzy interpolation scheme to analyze network traffic and detect malicious network activity. During the experiment, for malicious traffic, they used Mirai infected IoT devices and Raspberry Pis. Once malicious activity is detected, IOT-KEEPER automatically enforces network access restrictions against IoT devices generating this activity and prevents it from attacking other devices or services.

For that reason, a decentralized ML method termed Federated Learning (FL) is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This approach facilitates a collective learning of complex models between scattered devices guaranteeing data is not shared over the internet. As define by Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, each device utilizes its own local data for training and collaborate with others. Only the local computed updates, such as the model’s weights, are sent to the FL server for aggregation. For achieving a high accuracy, the steps are repeated in multiple rounds. A federation of the learned and shared models performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants helps to improve the entire system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Thus, FL is seen as an important ML approach to secure IoT devices. For this reason, Nguyen et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose an FL Intrusion Detection System based on anomaly detection for IoT called DIOT. It performs dynamic detection of any unknown attacks that deviate from the legitimate behavior of the device, since it only models legitimate network traffic. Different security gateways, each monitoring the traffic of one particular device type, locally train the Gated Recurrent Unit model and send it to an IoT security service for aggregation. Such a system is able to detect novel attacks. However, its accuracy for malware detection for devices in standby mode is still low (88.96%). Moreover, having a central FL server for aggregating the model through improved security of data, the participating devices’ communication limitations as well as data heterogeneity are some of the big challenges for model convergence. Few works have been done trying to solve the problem. Rahman et al. also proposed a Federated Learning based scheme for IoT intrusion detection that maintains data privacy by performing local training and inference of detection models. They evaluated their model on NSL-KDD dataset and then compared the results with the centralized approach. With data legislators and regulatory agencies imposing data privacy designing systems using decentralized approach is the way to</p>

Initially, we defined the way synchronous federated learning differs from fair synchronous federated learning and clearly outline the type of the edge devices that need to be involved and secured. Then, the possible way a device will interact with the server without uploading its dataset is also designed. The architecture and type of unsupervised algorithm to be used for anomaly detection is also designed. That is a deep auto-encoder for a federated environment. Finally, the framework evaluation is performed on Edge-IIoTset_2022 by considering the presence of Independent and Identically Distributed data across clients. This helps in describing the way the application is designed and evaluated for observing the unusual activities during the run-time.</p>

Upon receiving the initial model, all the participating edge devices parallelly train the global model with the dataset that they held locally on their storages. The updated weights from each participant are sent back to the server for aggregation. The server waits for some amount of time for all active participants to send their weights before averaging.

However, a larger number of local epochs may lead each device towards the optima of its local objective as opposed to the central objective. Besides, data continue to be generated on local devices which increases local gradient variations relative to the central model. Therefore, for the future,we plan to to incorporate a fairness approach to restrict the amount of local deviation by penalizing large changes from the current model at the server.

The server sends aggregated weights value to the devices, then the devices perform step, do the local training, return the updated weights send them to the server for server aggregation. For the server optimization purposes such as avoiding being idle, the server computes the averaging as longs as there are two or more active clients. The description of the approach consist of two procedures. One at server side and another at local edge device.
The procedure at the central server, which acts as the coordinator is describe in algorithm 2. The server randomly selects one available client.

<p id="S3.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Because the server computes average of the weights as they come, their current aggregated value of produced gradient by the server might not reflect the ones from struggling devices. For example as it is illustrated in Figure 2, the time the central server receives the value sent by the straggling devices (e.g., Client 2), it has so far updated the global model twice. This is one of the sources of inconsistency in the asynchronous update scheme when it comes to obtaining model updates from the server. This model inconsistency cannot be avoided in the real world settings because of data and system heterogeneity, or network delay. We considered this issue on the server side and used the strategy of feature scoring using in natural language processing to solve it.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning FL as a distributed machine learning approach performs training of a machine learning model on the device that gathered the data itself. In this scenario, the data is not share over the network for training purpose. Fedavg as one of FL algorithms permits a model to be copied to participating devices during a training session. The devices could be chosen at random, and a device can be aborted. The resulting models are sent to the coordinating server and then average models from the devices that finish training. By doing this, Federated learning solves the privacy problem for IoT/ IIoT devices that held sensitive data for the owners. In this project, we implemented this strategy on a recent dataset that represent the modern IoT/ IIoT device networks</p>

To alleviate the burden of to much computation being done on the client side and sharing many parameters on the network, which in turn become congested, most of computations are designed to be done by the server side. The consideration of IoT/IIoT devices in this experiment that can perform some computation such as smart fridge or smart cars is worthy to be clarified.</p>

However, the heterogeneity among the clients’ compute capabilities, the amount and quality of data can affect the training performance in terms of overall accuracy and convergence time. We designed a framework that allows fair participation of edge devices based on feature representation. We also considered the presence of Independent and Identically Distributed data across clients.</p>

The auto-encoder is responsible for turning the unlabeled traffic data into labeled traffic data by extracting features from the unlabeled data.

Auto-encoder takes place in two phases, i.e., encoding and decoding<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

For this reason, to detect anomaly, an autoencoder is supposed to be trained on a dataset containing normal network flows so that it can be able to learn how to reconstruct normal flows as outputs with a low reconstruction error when it is faced with benign data and a high reconstruction error on other abnormal data. That’s why for the centralized model, we first separated the normal flow from anomalous network flows. Then, from the normal data, we make a split of 80% for the train set and 20% for the validation set. The remaining dataset containing abnormal network flows was used for testing by computing the same 20% data points as used for validation. The training process is used for computing a threshold, which is set depending on the reconstruction error of training on normal data. While performing testing, if input data reconstructed error is higher than the computed threshold, then it is classified as abnormal otherwise the classification result is decided as a normal flow.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, for FL, we used the same strategy but, the data points were assigned to two clients by simulating the presence of different data distribution on devices (Non-IID character) using a function present in Flower framework, which is called latent Dirchlet Allocation. This function can produce some data distribution for classification problems from one label data to purely uniform distributed data depending on the concentration value called alpha – as is explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The lower the value of the alpha the more the distribution is different and diverse. On the other hand, if the distribution is high like where alpha is 1000, the dataset is normally distributed. For our experiment we used the alpha value of 10 which is enough to have non_IID dataset.</p>

<p id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Threshold is defined as the mean and standard deviation of the training MSE reconstructed loss. For the experiment, for centralized approach, after the training process is finished, a threshold is computed using the equation (9) and fixed at a certain number. This is based on computing mean and standard deviation of the reconstruction error of normal network flows. When testing, if a certain data sample mean squared reconstruction error is above the fixed threshold, it is classified as positive, otherwise it is considered as a normal network flow. In this experiment we computed the threshold using a formula that was used by Rey et al.[23]. The threshold is calculated for each client <math id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k\in K" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><mi id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">K</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><in id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></in><ci id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><ci id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝐾</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I6.i1.p1.1.m1.1c">k\in K</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

According to Mathur, Akhil, et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, Flower is a novel client-agnostic federated learning framework and one of the key design goals is to enable integrating with an inherently heterogeneous and ever-evolving edge device landscape. The Flower core framework, shown in Figure 1, implements the infrastructure to run heterogeneous workloads at scale. On the server side, there are three major components involved: the FL loop, the RPC server, and a (user customizable) Strategy. Strategy here refers to the federated averaging algorithms (e.g., FedAvg) used for aggregating the model parameters across clients. Clients connect to the RPC server which is responsible for monitoring these connections and for sending and receiving Flower Protocol messages. The FL loop is at the heart of the FL process: it orchestrates the learning process and ensures that progress is made. It does not, however, make decisions about how to proceed, those decisions are delegated to the currently configured Strategy implementation.</p>

To approve FL approach as a solution for securing IoT/IIoT devices network environment with privacy of data, we need to demonstrate its effectiveness. Thus, results will be evaluated and compared against a baseline approach. In this regard, the baseline means centralized machine learning process. Moreover, since we are introducing the non-synchronicity for FL approach, synchronous FedAvg assessment with non-synchronous FedAvg is planned. The experiments are carried out on a laptop with specifications of 128GB of RAM, graphic Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB, operating with macOS 10.15.7 (19H1824). All the data pre-processing was done within Python using public libraries.

<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Observing the results, the inference is that it is possible for the development of a model for securing modern edge devices in a privacy preserving manner. Table II and III give the average accuracy of the attack detection using the Vanilla FL approach versus the non-FL baseline. As it can be seen from the figure 7, the accuracy for the federated approach for all experiments came at 99.8% where the average accuracy of the non-FL baseline reached 99.7%. Looking at the testing results, the difference seems marginal for the simulation, and the number of false positive rates is better for synchronous FL with 0.16%. The potential of the federated-based approach could be the effect of training on decentralized data generated from various devices. It remains to be seen if the non-synchronous FL approach, which is our next activity, will also produce better results.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ever-growing industries and enterprises usage and diversification of the modern IoT/IIOT devices on their network has posed the risks of new type network attacks. Several approaches have been used to secure them; however, the data protection policy has become a barrier for applying a centralized approach. As such, the usage of Federated learning has been proven to be a solid solution for enterprise IoT/IIoT networks security. It addresses the issue of sensitive data flowing to and from IoT devices being stolen by preserving their privacy when training model is done without sharing of network logs between.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the online streaming of those devices’ data, labeling data is almost impossible, and they have heterogeneous computing capabilities. For this reason, we applied an autoencoder-based unsupervised approach, and training and evaluating the model was done with the help of federated machine learning.

However, a larger number of local epochs may lead each device towards the optima of its local objective as opposed to the central objective. Besides, data continue to be generated on local devices which increases local gradient variations relative to the central model. Therefore, for the future work, we will incorporate a fairness approach to restrict the amount of local deviation by penalizing large changes from the current model at the server. We have explained this in detail in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Federated Averaging ‣ IV Implemented approach and Response Features ‣ Unsupervised anomalies detection in IIoT edge devices’ networks using federated learning." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a>. Moreover, we are considering the issue of computation disparities among the devices participating for collaboratively training the global model. Because of that,the next step is to continue developing and evaluating a Fair federated machine learning using the deep autoencoder with the same settings as centralized and vanilla FedAvg and perform comparisons</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Among the activities that were planned, comparing Fair federated averaging algorithm performance on the new dataset and the vanilla Federated algorithm was on the list. However, due to time constraint of the project, we were not able to fully implement the designed Fair federated averaging algorithm. It is under implementation and considered as future work.</p>
