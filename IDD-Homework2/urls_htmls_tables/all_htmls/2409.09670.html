<p id="id38.id1" class="ltx_p">Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion aims to generate high spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) by fusing high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) and low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI). However, existing fusion methods encounter challenges such as unknown degradation parameters, incomplete exploitation of the correlation between high-dimensional structures and deep image features. To overcome these issues, in this article, an unsupervised blind fusion method for hyperspectral and multispectral images based on Tucker decomposition and spatial spectral manifold learning (DTDNML) is proposed. We design a novel deep Tucker decomposition network that maps LR-HSI and HR-MSI into a consistent feature space, achieving reconstruction through decoders with shared parameter. To better exploit and fuse spatial-spectral features in the data, we design a core tensor fusion network that incorporates a spatial spectral attention mechanism for aligning and fusing features at different scales. Furthermore, to enhance the capacity in capturing global information, a Laplacian-based spatial-spectral manifold constraints is introduced in shared-decoders. Sufficient experiments have validated that this method enhances the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral and multispectral fusion on different remote sensing datasets.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hyperspectral image (HSI) is a special image with a large amount of continuous spectral band information. In recent years, HSI is widely used in computer vision and remote sensing due to its detailed description of spectral features, like terrain classification<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, target detection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, change detection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and so on. Compared with HSIs, multispectral images (MSIs) have limited spectral information. However, limited by the intrinsic optical system, most of the captured images are lack of spatial or spectral information. To enhance the spatial resolution while preserving spectral dimension of the low resolution HSI (LR-HSI), a typical and effective way is to fuse it with high spatial resolution image. In the last decades, numerous effective fusion methods have been proposed, which can be mainly divided into two categories: model-driven methods and deep learning-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Model-driven methods primarily analyze the inherent relationships within the input data and construct a coupled solvable mathematical model. These methods solve the model through optimization techniques to obtain the best solution, including pan-sharpening, matrix decomposition, tensor decomposition and so on<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Pan-sharpening aims to fuse a single-channel high-resolution panchromatic image (HR-PAN) with MSI, providing higher spatial resolution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, this approach may lead to partial loss of spectral information and color distortion. Conversely, direct fusion of HSI and MSI incurs higher computational cost and faces challenges in extracting spatial-spectral features. Thus, the HSI-MSI coupled decomposition-reconstruction approach has gained attention, which mainly focuses on matrix decomposition and spectral unmixing to extract rich spectral information. However, unfolding a three-dimensional HSI into a two-dimensional representation often ignores the inherent high-order structural information of the data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Thanks to the high-dimensional representation properties of tensors, researchers gradually focus on tensor-based HSI-MSI fusion methods in recent years. In order to effectively enhance the extraction of relevant features in high-dimensional data, they can be decomposed into subspace and processed with mapping relationships corresponding to different dimensions. Even though model-based fusion methods have achieved satisfied performance, there are pressing issues that need to be addressed, including weak generalization performance of the models, high computational cost, and difficulties in capturing complex features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning (DL) has gained significant attention from researchers in various fields due to its powerful learning capability and data generalization ability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These techniques employ deep networks to learn deep spectral and spatial features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI respectively, and fuse the learned features to generate HR-HSI. Compared to model-based approaches, this method exhibits superior performance. Supervised training often struggles in blind fusion tasks aimed at learning unknown degradation parameters. Current unsupervised fusion methods, while capable of incorporating network-based iterative processes, predominantly focus on extracting deep spectral prior from LR-HSIs and abundance information from HR-MSIs, neglecting a direct representation of the data. In addition, there is still a lack of research on effective compression of the spectral and spatial dimension based on tensor representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, in this article, we propose an unsupervised HSI-MSI blind fusion method based on deep Tucker decomposition and spatial-spectral manifold learning to effectively achieve dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. A tensor-based deep autoencoder is constructed by employing convolution layers into the iterative process of the tensor Tucker fusion model. An enhanced approach for HSI-MSI fusion is designed, leveraging deep Tucker decomposition and multi-scale feature fusion. We consider the core tensor as a learnable feature within a deep Tucker decomposition network, allowing the encoded features of LR-HSI and HR-MSI to be learned and fused at multiple scales. The LR-HSI and HR-MSI are reconstructed through the coupled decoder to learn the factor matrices corresponding to different modes. The HR-HSI is reconstructed using the learned core tensor and the shared mode factor matrices parameters of the decoders. Considering the limited capacity of convolutional networks to capture global information and the risk of overfitting with only a simple decoder during reconstruction, we introduce weighted manifold learning through constructing a spatial-spectral manifold structure of inputs to constrain low-dimensional information. The learnable parameters of network are updated through joint loss optimization. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid development of spectral unmixing methods prompted researchers to think about how to more reasonably decompose HSI into purer endmember and abundance information. A fast sharpening method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> was proposed based on unmixing, which utilizes unconstrained least squares algorithm to solve the endmember matrix and abundance matrix. Its innovation lies in applying the unmixing process to sub images rather than the entire data. Yokoya <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed the HSI super-resolution method of Coupled Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF). It used nonnegative matrix factorization to alternately decompose LR-HSI and HR-MSI images to achieve the extraction of endmember and abundance information respectively. Due to CNMF’s application of NMF unmixing cycle replacement to LR-HSI and HR-MSI, it usually has a significant time cost.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, obtaining pure endmember and abundance information through matrix decomposition is a relatively effective fusion scheme. However, hyperspectral image data is usually represented in three-dimensional form, and this type of method requires unfolding the data into a two-dimensional matrix, thereby damaging the inherent high-dimensional structural information of the data. Benefited by the superiority of tensor decomposition models, hyperspectral fusion methods based on tensor decomposition models have become more famous in recent years.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning technology has strong learning performance and data generalization ability, and has attracted the attention of scholars in various fields in recent years. In hyperspectral fusion super-resolution tasks, CNN, Transformer and Residual networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have been proved that they could learn deep spectral and spatial features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI respectively. The early deep fusion theory<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> mainly adopted the idea of pan-sharpening, which sampled LR-HSI to the same scale as HR-MSI before further learning. However, only upsampling may cause a mismatch between spectral information and pixels, resulting in limited effectiveness. Compared to directly upsampling a single branch, the multi branch method adopts an alternative strategy to alleviate this problem, which involves gradually upsampling through deconvolution or pixel shuffling, where high-resolution information is injected into the corresponding scale.

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the basic denoising model based on tensors often come with high computational costs. To address the issue of dimensional explosion, tensor decomposition is commonly employed. Tensor Tucker decomposition is a popular subspace decomposition method that decomposes a high-dimensional tensor into a core tensor and factor matrices corresponding to different modes. Through utilizing the decomposed components, essential structures and patterns in the data are captured to identify and select the most representative spectral information. Furthermore, the performance of the model (<a href="#S3.E4" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) can be enhanced by utilizing Tucker decomposition<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to (<a href="#S3.E8" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>), Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are typically employed for iterative optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. However, shallow feature representations are insufficient for effectively extracting high-dimensional information, and phenomena such as overfitting may occur in sub-problem optimization. To overcome these issues, we treat the core tensor as a learnable and shareable feature extracted from the original data. Utilizing a multi-scale upsampling and downsampling network, our aim is to learn the mapping from the input image to the feature space, effectively capturing the spectral information from the LR-HSI and the spatial structural information from the HR-MSI. This approach significantly enhances the interpretability and fusion performance of the network. Additionally, through designing a reconstruction module with shared parameters, we can effectively learn the factor matrices associated with different modes in the tensor decomposition. Finally, weighted manifold constraints alone spatial and spectral modes are constructed for preserving detail spatial-spectral structure. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our proposed method over existing hyperspectral fusion super-resolution methods. The architecture of proposed method is shown in Fig.<a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main challenges in the fusion of different modalities is how to learn the mapping of shared information between modalities. Although there are existing studies that have experimented with feature alignment, these methods have largely focused on natural images or medical images<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. In the context of HSI and MSI fusion, it is crucial to consider how to extract the corresponding spatial and spectral relationships<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Thus, to achieve alignment and fusion of different modal features, we propose the Core Tensor Fusion Network (CTFN) based on attention and multi-scale feature fusion mechanisms</p>

being the sum of each row of the adjacency matrix. In Tucker decomposition, the factor matrices can be regarded as the low-dimensional space representation of the original tensor when unfolded along a certain mode. Assuming that the distances between samples in the factor matrices should also be minimized under this weight mapping. Inspired by this, we introduce spatial-spectral manifold constraint through constructing global Laplacian matrices. We expand and sample the input LR-HSI along the spectral dimension to construct a global adjacency matrix as <math id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{A}_{S}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1a"><msub id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">𝐀</mi><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">S</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.2">𝐀</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.3">𝑆</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1c">\mathbf{A}_{S}</annotation></semantics></math>, where the samples are <math id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{X}_{(3)}(i,:)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.2.cmml">𝐗</mi><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.cmml">(</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.1.cmml">3</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.2.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mo rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.3.cmml">:</mo><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4"><times id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.2.2">𝐗</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.1">3</cn></apply><interval closure="open" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.4.3.2"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.2.2">𝑖</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3.3">:</ci></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.9.m9.3c">\mathbf{X}_{(3)}(i,:)</annotation></semantics></math>.

Similarly, we adopt a similar approach to design the learning method for SRF parameters learning. Unlike PSF, SRF operates on the spectral dimension and follows an imaging principle that involves accumulating and normalizing the continuous spectral information along a certain position. This can be achieved by using a 1x1 Conv layer followed by a normalization layer.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1) Pavia University</span>: In general, all the methods demonstrate promising fusion results. Specifically, within the model-driven methods, CSTF performs well by taking into account the high-dimensional structural correlation present in Pavia University dataset. However, traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted image priors, which leads to lower performance compared to deep learning-based methods. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison of fusion results, we present pseudo-color images, RMSE error maps, and SAM error maps generated by these fusion algorithms with sampling ratios of 8 as shown in Fig.<a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Datasets and Experiments Setup ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. From the graphical representations, it is evident that tensor-based methods outperform the others in preserving both spatial and spectral information, with UDTN and MIAE being suboptimal. Moreover, we provide detailed quantitative analysis results of the nine methods in the Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-B Experimental Results ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. The empirical findings consistently support the superiority of DTDNML over other methods, as evidenced by its superior performance in key evaluation metrics such as PSNR and SAM. Notably, the most notable improvement is achieved at a sampling ratio of 4, where DTDNML achieves a PSNR of 36.41dB, representing an improvement of approximately 1dB. Similarly, at a sampling ratio of 8, the proposed method achieves 35.18dB of PSNR and reduces SAM to 4.23 degrees. However, it is important to acknowledge that in this case, DTDNML exhibits relatively weaker performance in overall SSIM when compared to other methods, primarily due to the challenge of fusing wavelength information in the presence of inconsistent illumination conditions. Additionally, HySure and MIAE demonstrate a strong ability to learn spectral features.</p>

Even if each of method exhibits good performance in exploiting spatial information, there is a noticeable difference in the spectral dimension. From the results, MIAE stands out, although, in the extraction and preservation of spectral information in the lower-left corner river region among them, there is significant spectral distortion in the upper right house area. In general, however, DTDNML outperforms HyCoNet, MIAE and UDTN in overall performance. We present a detailed analysis of the metrics in the Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-B Experimental Results ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. It is clearly found that both HSIs achieve satisfactory results across all the metrics.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Notably, tensor decomposition-based methods outperform matrix decomposition-based methods. The PSNR curve of each band is shown in Fig.<a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Experimental Results ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.(b). Though curve exhibits small fluctuations between some bands, the value of PSNR is over 40 dB. For SAM, the proposed method presents shortcomings. We found that, in both cases, our method is about 0.1 to 0.4 degrees higher than the best and second best methods. One reason is that matrix decomposition-based methods extract pure endmember information through spectral unmixing, which ensures stability during the feature extraction stage. The results shows that HyCoNet performs better in spectral reconstruction than other methods, and the value of SAM can be reduced to nearly 3 degrees. On the other hand, the high-dimensional features of tensor decomposition are challenging to learn, leading to a trade-off between preserving spatial structural information and sacrificing certain spectral correlations.</p>

It can be observed that CNMF exhibits noticeable spatial distortions, with the spatial structure of the vegetation around the White House appearing blurry. Although our proposed method achieves desirable results in the housing area compared to CuCANet and MIAE, stripe-like interferences appeared in the surrounding vegetation. This is a drawback of Conv networks for reconstruct process, which we mitigate by incorporating manifold constraints to preserve spatial structure.

<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">When the sampling ratio is 4, overall, deep learning methods based on tensor representation are not as effective in spectral reconstruction as methods based on matrix decomposition. But DTDNML can achieve optimal performance in PSNR, which is only higher 0.3 dB than the suboptimal. Meanwhile, when the sampling ratio is set to 8, uSDN and CuCANet show strong competitiveness, particularly in terms of the SAM metric. We attribute this phenomenon to two main factors. First of all, the dataset itself has significant noise in some specific spectral bands, leading to instability in the fusion results. Secondly, considering that WaDC consists of 191 spectral bands, it is challenging to achieve stable learning of high-dimensional features. The preservation of high-dimensional information can only be achieved by increasing the size of the core tensor, but this also adds computational complexity. Although our method is limited in certain metrics on WaDC, the PSNR of DTDNML is better than others in most bands from Fig.<a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Experimental Results ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.(c).</p>

Considering its rich spectral information, we pay more attention on the extent of spectrum loss.

<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Even if in some bands DTDNML get lower indices, it is stable in all bands and got the maximum average value. But tensor-based methods still have certain limitations in handling high-dimensional data, particularly in dimensionality reduction and learning of high-dimensional features. It is not difficult to find that even though our method has improved in terms of indicators, compared with matrix decomposition and spectral unmixing methods, HySure is the most challenging in terms of the loss of spatial structure and spectral information. Among the deep learning approaches, CuCANet and HyCoNet are the most challenging. To precisely observe the quality of the reconstructed images when SR is 8, the fusion results of all methods is shown in Fig.<a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B Experimental Results ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. Each of them demonstrates satisfied fusion performance, especially in the reconstruction of larger areas such as building sections. However, some details exhibit distortion. For example, the details in the middle-right region of the image are not fully preserved, where MIAE fails to handle roof information effectively. CSTF exhibits noticeable texture loss in its results, which is also reflected in the metrics, because of the limitations on generating core tensor of this method.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to fully demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed CTFN with proposed methods in the experiments, we conducte ablation experiments on four datasets with two groups: the module ablation and loss function discussion. In the first group, there are five cases: <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1) <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Case 1</span></span>: DTDNML without CTFN, <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2) <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Case 2</span></span>: DTDNML without SSAM, <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">3) <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Case 3</span></span>: DTDNML only without Spectral-Attention, <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">4) <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Case 4</span></span>: DTDNML only without Spatial-Attention, and <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">5) <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Case 5</span></span>: DTDNML. The first case means the use of convolutional layers to implement Tucker decomposition and obtain the core tensor instead of CTFN. The second case, on the other hand, excludes the usage of SSAM. The third and fourth cases respectively represent the exclusion of spectral or spatial attention in the proposed CTFN, primarily comparing the impact of using spectral and spatial attention mechanism alone on the fusion performance. Simultaneously, the pivotal aspect of our designed SFB, SSAB, SDAB, and SUAB lies in the interaction of attention mechanisms between modules.

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The ablation experiments conducted on the four datasets revealed significant impacts of each module on the fusion super-resolution task. In the SanDiego dataset, the use of SSAM significantly improved the PSNR index by 4dB. Moreover, it also helps to reduce spectral loss. It can be clearly observed on the Pavia and Chikusei datasets that CTFN effectively improves the performance of spectral reconstruction. There is a decrease of over 7 degrees and 13 degrees in SAM, respectively. However, in the WaDC, there is a relative increase in the SAM on case 2. The reason for this phenomenon may be that the relationship between scales is not fully considered in the process of multi-scale feature learning, resulting in information loss. Comparing the experimental results of the case 3 and 4, we found that although using a single attention mechanism can effectively enhance performance, significant spectral losses still exist on the WaDC dataset. Moreover, the PSNR indicator on three datasets is approximately 1 to 2 dB lower compared to the case 5. This phenomenon emphasizes the importance of our proposed SSAM in the process of multi-scale feature fusion.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.2" class="ltx_p">For the core tensor dimension, our discussion primarily revolves around the spatial and spectral dimensions, given the consistent spatial dimensions of the simulated data used in the experiments. We organized seven groups for the the spatial dimension, and six groups for the spectral dimension. From the Fig.<a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-C Ablation Studies ‣ V Experiment ‣ Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial–Spectral Manifold Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the reduction in spectral dimensionality also effectively demonstrates the effectiveness of our low-dimensional structure learning. Alhough, the optimal dimensions of core tensor in different datasets are different, they are maintained at a certain proportion. The ratio spatial dimension reduction is around 0.85.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we propose a HSI and MSI blind fusion method based on deep Tucker decomposition and spatial-spectral manifold learning. The core tensor is treated as a shared deep feature learned by LR-HSI and HR-MSI. We utilize theep Tucker decomposition network to generate the shared core tensor. A spatial-spectral attention mechanism is equipped in fusion module to storage multi-scale spectral and spatial information. During the reconstructed process, we transfer the mode factor matrices iterative updating into learnable decoders, and reconstruct HR-HSI by sharing parameters of networks. For the joint loss function, the blind training strategy and manifold learning is used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction of deep feature representation. The effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method are validated through comparisons with existing super-resolution algorithms on publicly available datasets. However, some limitations of this work are identified and further improvements are needed through analysis of the experimental results. For instance, it is necessary to consider how to improve the compression and dimensionality reduction methods to minimize spectral loss. Additionally, it is crucial to design loss functions with better generalization performance to reduce the training cost and instability of the unsupervised model.</p>
