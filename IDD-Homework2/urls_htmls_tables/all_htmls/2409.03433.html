<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Precise, consistent, and reliable positioning is crucial for a multitude of uses. In order to achieve high precision global positioning services, multi-sensor fusion techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Vision integration system,
combine the strengths of various sensors. This technique is essential for localization in complex environments and has been widely used in the mass market.
However, frequent signal deterioration and blocking
in urban environments exacerbates the degradation of GNSS positioning and negatively impacts the performance of the multi-sensor integration system. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observation data in the urban environment, we offer an innovation-based cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) method to reduce the influence of multipath effects and cycle slips on location induced by obstruction in urban settings. The method obtains the innovations of GNSS observations with the cluster analysis method. Then the innovations are used to detect the cycle slips and multipath. Compared with the residual-based method, the innovation-based method avoids the residual overfitting caused by the least square method, resulting in better detection of outliers within the GNSS observations. The vehicle tests carried out in urban settings verify the proposed
approach. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 0.23m, 0.11m, and 0.31m in the east, north and up components can be achieved by the GNSS/INS/Vision tightly coupled system with the I-EDM method, which has a maximum of 21.6% improvement when compared with the residual-based EDM (R-EDM) method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving has captured significant attention in both research and practical applications, where GNSS serves as the primary positioning technology to provide continuous, accurate, and stable positioning results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Despite the worldwide prevalence and extensive utility of GNSS, its signals are susceptible to disruptions such as multipath effects and signal loss in complex urban settings, resulting in decreased positioning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the utilization of multi-sensors provides a more comprehensive and robust positioning capability, which becomes the optimal choice for pose estimation in urban scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating different sensors, such as INS and cameras, with GNSS can fully utilize the locally accurate characteristics of INS/Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the global drift-free characteristics of GNSS. Fusing GNSS/INS has been widely studied. Significant improvements in accuracy, continuity, and reliability of localization are carefully analyzed and evaluated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, in an integrated system where GNSS serves as the cornerstone for providing global positioning, the positioning accuracy is compromised or even worsens due to the rapid error accumulation of the microelectromechanical system inertial measurement unit (MEMS-IMU) when GNSS observations are affected by multipath effects or lost tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the drifts of MEMS-IMU, the low-cost visual camera is applied in GNSS/INS integration system to offer redundant measurements. The multi-sensor fusion extended Kalman filter (MSF-EKF) framework proposed by Lynen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> allows for the seamless loose sensor-feed integration of GNSS, INS, and visual sensors. A semi-tightly coupled framework of multi-GNSS/INS/Vision based on graph optimization is proposed by Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The method produces consistent and accurate global positioning outputs and operates well in GNSS-challenged environments. A tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision system with open-source code is proposed by Cao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>; However, the method only incorporates Doppler shift and code pseudorange measurements. To enhance the navigation accuracy during GNSS outages, Liao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> propose a tightly coupled framework to make full use of measurements from real-time kinematic (RTK)/INS/Vision. The method improves the accuracy and robustness of the system under conditions where GNSS is unavailable. However, these methods regard GNSS observations as equal weight, without considering the impact of outliers on the system, thereby failing to make the most of the GNSS observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Effective GNSS measurement quality control is key to ensuring that the estimator is not affected by outliers in urban situations. A practical quality control technique is to assign weights according to the quality of the signals. The common GNSS weighting strategies include: signal to noise ratio (SNR) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, satellite elevation angle model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, SNR and satellite elevation angle hybrid model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> et al. However, computing the appropriate weights for GNSS observations in urban situations is challenging. Leveraging sky plots to divide the satellites into line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and decreasing the weights of NLOS can increase the positioning accuracy in urban settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, this approach is limited to adjusting weights at the satellite levels, which means it can not modify the weights corresponding to different frequencies from the same satellite. An additional technique for measurement quality control is fault detection and exclusion (FDE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. A multiple-fault GNSS FDE technique is proposed by Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> for an integrated GNSS/IMU system. A parallel GNSS FDE technique for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision integration through factor graph optimization is presented by Jiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However, they only perform quality control on the pseudorange observations and do not consider the carrier phase observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Even though significant progress has been made in the area of positioning in challenging situations, the GNSS quality control still requires extensive attention. In our earlier work, a unified cycle slip, multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (EDM) method is proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, in which we utilize the clustering method to separate the cycle slips and multipath from the carrier phase observations aided by the predicted VIO positioning. However, this methodology entails repeatedly estimating the parameters using the least square method, followed by cycle slips detection and multipath modeling with the observation residuals. Whereas, the residuals are inevitably absorbed into the estimated parameters (e.g. positioning and receiver clock) with the least square method, leading to inaccurate outlier culling and cycle slip detection. Meanwhile, the method relies on the predicted VIO position to preprocess the GNSS observations. In the case of GNSS blocking frequently, setting the uncertainty of the predicted position becomes challenging. This contribution proposes an innovation-based EDM method. The innovations are applied to identify the cycle slips and multipath in the GNSS observations. To obtain the innovations, the inter-frequency bias (IFB) is estimated with the clustering method, and the receiver clock is obtained using the satellite with the highest elevation angle. Furthermore, considering the persistent impact of multipath on ambiguities, we mark the ambiguity as the cycle clip when the accumulated multipath exceeds a certain threshold to mitigate the influence of multipath effect on localization. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the innovation-based EDM method and residual-based EDM method.</p>

Based on the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF), the pseudorange and carrier phase observations from GNSS, the raw data of MEMS-IMU, and the images from the stereo camera are fused. The INS mechanization is used to carry out the state propagation once the system has been initialized. The predicted state variables will also help with feature matching and tracking in the image processing, as well as the preprocessing of outlier culling and cycle slip detection in GNSS processing. The state variables and associated covariance in the estimator will be augmented upon receiving new visual or GNSS observations. Once the new observations are deemed to be available, the corresponding state variables and the covariance will be updated in the measurement update. After completing the filter, the state variables are ultimately fixed through ambiguity resolution.</p>

After the measurement update at each epoch, we will fix the between-satellite between-station ambiguities to integers, if possible, then the fixed solutions will be obtained. In this study, the integer least-square estimation of the float ambiguities is searched using the least-square ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Although fixing ambiguities can enhance the positioning accuracy of RTK, if the float ambiguities are excessively erroneous, they tend to result in incorrect fixes, leading to fixed positioning solutions worse than the float solutions. Therefore, reliable initial float ambiguities are crucial for high-precision RTK positioning.</p>

We can observe that the proposed I-EDM method achieves the highest positioning accuracy of 0.31<math id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math>. This is because our method effectively models the multipath effects in the GNSS signals by computing the innovation of the pesudorange observations and carrier phase observations. Therefore the accuracy of the positioning is significantly improved by eliminating the impact of the multipath effects. On the contrary, the other three methods do not account for the significant multipath effect caused by the obstructions in urban situations, resulting in the positioning accuracy only reaching the meter level. Then, by comparing the hybrid method with the SNR and satellite elevation angle method, we can see that the positioning performance of the hybrid method is better than that of the SNR and satellite elevation angle method, achieving on average a 28.1% and 38.4% improvement in 3D direction. And the performance of the SNR method is better than that of the satellite elevation angle method. The SNR method allows for assigning reasonable weights to the observations of different frequencies and types from the same satellite. However, the satellite elevation angle method only assigns the weights according to the satellite type. Consequently, the SNR method provides more accurate modelling of observations at the signal level, resulting in higher precision in positioning compared to the satellite elevation angle method. Furthermore, the hybrid method combines the advantages of both methods, achieving better positioning accuracy.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compared the performance of the cycle slip detection of R-EDM and I-EDM methods. The reference trajectory generated from the tactical-grade IMU is employed to obtain the real cycle slips and multipath <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For fairness, the same criteria described in equation (<a href="#S2.E17" title="In II-F Innovation-based EDM Method ‣ II Methods ‣ An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) are utilized to access the cycle slips and multipath of R-EDM, I-EDM, and real values. The false detection rate of cycle slip is displayed in Fig. <a href="#S3.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ III-B1 Cycle Slip Detection Results ‣ III-B Comparison of R-EDM and I-EDM Method ‣ III Experiments ‣ An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. The false detection rate means that the cycle slips exist within the real data, yet the method fails to detect them. This omission leads to incorrect ambiguity calculation, which is harmful to navigation performance, especially in urban experiments. The periods when cycle slip detection errors occur essentially coincide with intervals of high PDOP values, as shown in Fig.<a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III Experiments ‣ An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. This correlation demonstrates that multipath effects and signal loss in GNSS observations often result in cycle slips. More specifically, R-EDM and I-EDM have average error rates of 0.07% and 0.03%, respectively. This demonstrates that in the residual-based method, the cycle slips are partially absorbed into the estimated parameters such as IFB and clock biases when solving least squares, making it challenging to detect the minor cycle slips within the GNSS observations. Conversely, the innovation-based method only leverages the raw GNSS observations to detect the cycle slips, which are more sensitive to minor cycle slips.</p>

When GNSS loses tracking frequently, setting the uncertainty of the prior position estimated by IMU and vision observations becomes challenging. The I-EDM method, on the other hand, avoids the problem of setting uncertainty of prior position constraints and the deficiency estimation of the outliers.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The utilization of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration system provides a more comprehensive and robust positioning capability. However, multipath and cycle slips brought on by obstructions deteriorate GNSS location performance in urban areas, which further impairs multi-sensor integration positioning. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, this work develops an innovation-based cycle slip, multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) technique. The cluster analysis method is utilized to extract the innovations from GNSS measurements, which are subsequently employed to identify cycle slips and multipath.</p>

Moreover, a detailed comparison between the performance of residual-based and innovation-based EDM methods is conducted. Compared with the residual-based EDM method, the innovation-based EDM method obtains a decrease in average error rates of cycle detection by 57.1%, a 21.6% improvement in positioning accuracy, and a 49.9% reduction in running time consumption. These results show the significant improvements achieved by the proposed innovation-based EDM method over the residual-based approach.</p>
