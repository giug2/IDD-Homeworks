<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technology for next-generation AI systems that allows a number of workers, i.e., edge devices, collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their data locally to prevent privacy leakage. Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can democratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, the noisy bandwidth-limited multi-hop wireless connections can lead to delayed and nomadic model updates, which significantly slows down the FL convergence speed. To address such challenges, this paper aims to accelerate FL convergence over wireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. In particular, the FL convergence optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are developed, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize the model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the remote server. To validate the proposed solutions, FedEdge is developed and implemented, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL over multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. FedEdge allows us to fast prototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system optimization methods in real wireless devices. Moreover, a physical experimental testbed is implemented by customizing the widely adopted Linux wireless routers and ML computing nodes. Such testbed can provide valuable insights into the practical performance of FL in the field. Finally, our experimentation results on the testbed show that the proposed network-accelerated FL system can practically and significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL system empowered by the production-grade commercially-available wireless networking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning, specifically federated learning (FL), has been envisioned as a key technology for enabling next-generation AI at scale. FL significantly reduces privacy risks and communication costs, which are critical in modern AI systems. FL allows workers (i.e., edge devices) to collaboratively learn a global model and maintains the locality of data to reduce the privacy vulnerability. The workers only need to send their local model updates to the server, which aggregates these updates to continuously improve the shared global model. FL can greatly reduce the required number of communication rounds for model convergence by increasing computation parallelization, where more edge devices are involved as the workers, and by increasing local computation, where the worker performs multiple iterations of model updates before sending the updated model to the server. Through FL, edge devices can still learn much more accurate models with small local datasets. As a result, FL has demonstrated its success for a variety of applications, such as on-device item ranking, content suggestions for on-device keyboards, and next word prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its great potential advantages to democratize AI, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multi-hop FL</span>, short for FL over multi-hop wireless edge computing networks, is still an unexploited area. The classic FL systems use single-hop wireless communications to directly connect to the edge servers or connect to edge routers that then reach the remote cloud servers via high-speed Internet core. In multi-hop FL networks, the end-to-end (E2E) model updates between the server and workers need to go through multiple noisy and bandwidth-limited wireless links. This results in much slower and nomadic model updates due to much longer and more random E2E delay. Such profound communication constraints fundamentally challenge the efficiency and effectiveness of classic FL systems as detailed below:</p>

The routing paths towards the central server can be easily saturated in wireless multi-hop networks due to the limited network bandwidth.In addition, different from classic distributed model training in data centers, FL exploits production networks to carry on model training traffic between workers and the server. Therefore, FL traffic has to compete with the background production network traffic (e.g., Internet traffic) for limited network bandwidth. As a result, when the number of workers or the background traffic volume increases, network congestion will deteriorate progressively, which critically degrades the benefits of computation parallelization and slows down convergence speed.</p>

With such assumption, the impact of wireless communication control parameters (e.g., transmission power) on the FL related metrics (e.g., model update delay and loss reduction) can be formulated in an explicit closed-form mathematical model, which greatly eases the FL system optimization. Such model-based optimization is not feasible in multi-hop FL, where the FL performance metrics (e.g., FL convergence time) cannot be explicitly formulated as a closed-form function of the networking control parameters, such as packet forwarding decision at each router.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our overall objective is to minimize the run-time convergence time to achieve the desired FL accuracy. Towards this goal, the optimal strategy is to minimize the worker-server delay of the slowest worker, which experiences the maximum delay among all workers. However, in highly dynamic wireless environments, the role of the slowest one can be randomly switched among different workers as time proceeds. In this paper, we sought a sub-optimal solution, where we minimize the average end-to-end (E2E) delay between all workers and the server. However, even for such sub-optimal solution, we cannot apply the classic model-based optimization because the server-worker E2E delay cannot be explicitly formulated as a closed-form function of the routing/forwarding decisions. As a result, a model-free optimization strategy based on multi-agent reinforcement learning is much more desirable, where each wireless router exploits its instantaneous local experiences to collaboratively learn the delay-minimum routing paths between the workers and the server.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The MA-RL routing is one kind of the distributed routing algorithms. However, the key idea of RL is to improve the policy by learning from experiences including failures. Therefore, an agent can freely explore and learn all possible routing paths including the ones with loops, where the data packets continue to be routed within the network in an circle. Our experiments show that the routing loops can have a catastrophic impact on a RL-based networking, such as the slowly converged routing policy and TCP disconnections between the server and workers. To address this problem, we propose a action space refining algorithm, which aims to construct the loop-free action spaces for each router in such a way that the routers can independently and distributively explore any forwarding action (i.e., the next-hop router) from such refined action space, while avoiding generating routing paths with loops. The refined action space is defined with respect to each pair of ingress and egress routers. The ingress router is the router from which the FL traffic flow enters the network and the egress router is the router from which the FL traffic leaves the network. Therefore, the maximum number of action spaces constructed on each router is equal to <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2N" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">2</cn><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">2N</annotation></semantics></math>, where N is the total number of routers in the network.

First, build the global network topology. Then, find all the loop-free paths between the ingress router and egress router by applying iterative depth-search-first (DSF) traversal or K-shortest path finding algorithms (with sufficiently large K). Next, for each router, there may exist multiple paths traversing it and its action space is a set of the next-hop nodes of all the traversing paths. It is easy to prove that employing such refined and loop-free action spaces, our MA-RL forwarding scheme will surely learn the routing paths without loops.</p>

What is more important, they did not support the reconfiguration of the network stack and did not allow us to incorporate new networking schemes. Therefore, they are not suitable to study the interplay between federated networking and federated computing. In addition, the frameworks mentioned above were highly dependent on WebSockets for their communication, which leads to a reactive disconnection between the worker and server when their links experience a short-lived delay. Moreover, except FedML, these frameworks can not be readily deployed on the physical edge devices without cumbersome modifications. To address the above challenges, we develop and prototype FedEdge, which is the first experimental framework for wireless multi-hop FL.
The full pipeline of prototyping, deployment, and evaluation is expected to be easily performed with real wireless devices given the FedEdge framework.</p>

This facilitates the simultaneous evolutions of federating computing and federated networking solutions and allows us to evaluate the complex FL system under diverse network and computation conditions. Second, FedEdge is a highly programmable experimentation platform that can be easily deployed on real wireless systems. With these two features, we can design and deploy new FL algorithms along with customized datasets, preprocessing schemes, and training pipelines. Simultaneously, we can innovate on various networking mechanisms and test their impact on the performance of federated learning systems.

Federated networking is responsible for providing fast wireless networking connections between the aggregator and workers. What is more important, federated networking system is designed in nature to facilitate AI-empowered networking optimization, including customizable actor-critic RL agent for instantiating a variety of AI-enabled routing algorithms, in-band telemetry that enables cost-efficient data collections for online RL training, and programmable routing table (datapath) for real-time RL policy executions.</p>

Next, our FedEdge Datasets module will split the dataset respectively such that data is readily available for training. Data for the worker is selected at the beginning of the FL training procedure. In this data staging process, the user can further preprocess the data using FedEdge’s builtin functions to encode, normalize, and standardize the data. Such synthesized data is then gathered into batches by the batch size specified during the initial training epoch. Furthermore, batches are converted to a Tensorflow-accelerated data pipeline to avoid the IO bottleneck, thereby accelerating the runtime of each epoch.</p>

With such flexibility in the training process, we provide a highly customizable pipeline for consuming data during the training process with two sub-modules including data filtering and sampling. At each round of global training step, the aggregator can pass parameters such as the data class to filter and sampling technique for the training process. In this case, the sampling procedure will determine whether the entire filtered data should be used or have to be sub-sampled to limit the number of samples consumed for the training step. To simplify the above-mentioned process, we consider all datasets will contain a META which provides the key statistics about the dataset, such as the number of classes and the number of samples for each class and in total.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedEdge aggregator node is the central node that controls the life cycle of FL training. The aggregator has a crucial role in initiating, coordinating, and monitoring the FL training cycle. Before beginning the FL training cycle, each worker should register their IDs, a combination of IP and port numbers to the aggregator’s worker registry built into the FedEdge Communicate End-point router module. This registry is constructed using a hash map that stores worker ID as the key and their communication HTTP/GRPC end-point as the value. Only registered workers can participate in the training cycle. The aggregator performs a two-stage process to launch the FL training sequence: (1) Construct the model and upload it to the workers (2) Launch the training with the user-supplied training configuration. In the following section, we briefly discuss the two-stage process:</p>

Besides, users can easily modify the in-built models and integrate their customized loss functions. Each model will then be trained with the user’s choice of optimization algorithms. Currently, FedEdge compute module provides in-built support for the regularized local SGD algorithm by default, which can be considered as the generalized FedAvg. This newly created model is then shared with the workers for training. To send the model, the aggregator revisits the worker registry to obtain each worker’s HTTP/GRPC end-points. If the worker successfully received the model, then the corresponding worker state will be updated based on the message from the worker with the context <math id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="GLOBAL\_MODEL\_RECV" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">G</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1b" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">B</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1c" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1d" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.7" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1e" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.8" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml">_</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1f" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.9" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml">M</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1g" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.10" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1h" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.11" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.11.cmml">D</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1i" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.12" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.12.cmml">E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1j" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.13" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.13.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1k" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.14" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.14.cmml">_</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1l" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.15" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.15.cmml">R</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1m" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.16" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.16.cmml">E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1n" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.17" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.17.cmml">C</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1o" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.18" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.18.cmml">V</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐺</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑂</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5">𝐵</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.6">𝐴</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.7">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.8">_</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.9">𝑀</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.10">𝑂</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.11.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.11">𝐷</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.12.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.12">𝐸</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.13.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.13">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.14.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.14">_</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.15.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.15">𝑅</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.16.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.16">𝐸</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.17.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.17">𝐶</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.18.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1.1.18">𝑉</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1.m1.1c">GLOBAL\_MODEL\_RECV</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

To begin the FL training cycle, user needs to supply the following parameters at the minimum: global rounds, local rounds per node, dataset repo and dataset, model to train, and data partition type. The global round controls the total number of rounds workers will use to train the shared model, and local rounds define the number of epochs each worker will use to update the local model. Since our FedEdge framework hosts datasets from a variety of repo’s, users should specifically mention the dataset and the repo used for the experiment. With the user-supplied parameters, a training cycle is constructed where a cycle is defined as (1) launching a global round (2) wait to receive models from all workers and updates the state of the corresponding worker to <math id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="LOCAL\_MODEL\_RECV" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">C</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1b" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1c" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1d" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.7" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml">_</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1e" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.8" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml">M</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1f" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.9" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1g" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.10" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml">D</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1h" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.11" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.11.cmml">E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1i" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.12" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.12.cmml">L</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1j" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.13" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.13.cmml">_</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1k" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.14" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.14.cmml">R</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1l" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.15" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.15.cmml">E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1m" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.16" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.16.cmml">C</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1n" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.17" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.17.cmml">V</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑂</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.4">𝐶</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.5">𝐴</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.6">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.7">_</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.8">𝑀</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.9">𝑂</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.10">𝐷</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.11.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.11">𝐸</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.12.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.12">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.13.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.13">_</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.14.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.14">𝑅</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.15.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.15">𝐸</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.16.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.16">𝐶</ci><ci id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.17.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.17">𝑉</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1c">LOCAL\_MODEL\_RECV</annotation></semantics></math>.

As more research efforts are focused on improving the overall FL system performance by improvising computation, little to no effort has been targeted towards optimizing the communication layer. We believe the lack of a flexible platform is one of the inherent challenges to pursue research in this venue. Extendability and ease of programmability as the objective, we adopted modular design which consists (1) Send and Recv (2) End-point router and (3) FL-Transport Layer as the submodules. In the following section, we will briefly discuss the functionality of the modules as mentioned earlier:</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedEdge platform exposes functions for FedEdge Compute and dataset layers through an End-Point router (EPR). This routing layer routes messages from external nodes to the respective processing function to handle data pipeline, model training, and model exchange. Since each FedEdge node provides some service in addition to consuming a service, EPR is designed to function in a dual role such as a server and client. In the client role, the FedEdge node can send registration requests, upload local models, and reply to the aggregator’s status query. On the other hand, it accepts requests from the aggregator to preprocess the dataset, launch training, and receive a global model in the server role. To adopt a synergy in FedEdge nodes, we proposed a communication protocol. The general idea of the FedEdge communication protocol (FedEdge COMM) is to define the messages that should be exchanged between the aggregator and worker nodes. Besides, the protocol also defines the status flags that should be set by each node based on the role type and its current status. The communication flow of our FedEdge COMM is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Send and Recv ‣ IV-B Federated Computing ‣ IV FedEdge Design and Prototyping ‣ EdgeML: Towards Network-Accelerated Federated Learning over Wireless Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. Following the FedEdge COMM, the aggregator node first initializes the port for accepting connections from the worker. Besides, the connection state tracker is initialized to keep track of the nodes communicating with the aggregator. After this phase, worker nodes register their IP address and device ID to the worker registry within the connection state tracker module. Once the aggregator has received the training resources, it will initialize the global model and share it with all the workers within the worker registry. If the workers successfully receive the model, a notification will be sent to the aggregator. If the aggregator determines that it has the required number of workers for the training phase, the training request is dispatched to all workers with the batch size and number of rounds. On receiving training requests, the worker initiates a training round and updates the local model to the aggregator at the end of the training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedEdge nodes on Wireless multi-hop networks are prone to experiencing dynamic network conditions that might cause unreliable transport layer operation. With modularity at the core of the FedEdge framework design, we let programmers freely define the underlying transport layer mechanism for the FedEdge COM API. While the EPR submodule exposes FedEdge Compute and dataset layers’ functions, these APIs are accessible based on the transport layer of FL (FL-Transport). With service-based architecture as the design principle behind FL-transport’s transport layer, we have adopted two communication mechanisms (1) HTTP- REST API and (2) GRPC.</p>

Our HTTP- TCP REST API is constructed on top of the TCP protocol stack. Therefore, we extend REST APIs programmability to configure the number of TCP streams, session control, and keep alive. To simplify the payload transport, we utilized JSON message format to transport the FL model. In addition to the FL model, the user can easily extend the API to add additional attributes such as the timestamp of the model and the total time take to complete training by defining new key/value pair before JSON encoding. To simplify the implementation efforts, we adopted a range of frameworks such as FastAPI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, Asyncio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and HTTPx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> for building the communication protocol. FastAPI framework facilitates application developers to implement REST API for functions that can be invoked by remote nodes using HTTP as the transport protocol. Asyncio and HTTPx enable the developers to implement asynchronous HTTP clients so that the aggregator can communicate with all workers within the cluster concurrently. While server function within the aggregator and worker is built around FastAPI and HTTPx, client functions are built on top of AiOHTTP and Asyncio.</p>

The core idea of the GRPC framework is to define a service that will implement the interfaces which can be called by the remote entities to execute an operation. In FedEdge framework, we leveraged GRPC as the communication channel between the server and all workers. Besides, the dual message format is supported over the channel such using either JSON or Protocol buffers. While JSON encodes messages as texts, protocol buffers use a compiler to transcode structured data into serialized byte streams. In addition, there exists native support for asynchronous execution, HTTP2, and data compression, which significantly reduce the overall traffic volume in wireless multi-hop FL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous section, we detailed our design and implementation of federated computing. The key objective of our work is to improve the convergence time of federated learning systems by optimizing communication delay over multi-hop wireless networks. To tame the network latency and to implement reinforcement learning routing module, first we need a platform that enables visibility of per-packet networking statistics (such as delay) for RL training. In addition, we need to realize distributed and programmable network control so that the MA-RL policies can be learned, deployed, and executed in a real-time fashion. To satisfy the above two requirements, we developed a federated networking subsystem by enhancing and customizing WiNOS, a distributed wireless network operating system proposed in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. The federated networking subsystem is composed of three layers (1) Dataplane, (2) Network Core services, and (3) RL Applications. Compared with WiNOS, the new enhancements include the redesigned dataplane and upgraded core services to support multi-radio networking, customized in-band telemetry processing to support federated networking, and the new RL application with domain-specific action space refining. The details of some important components of federated networking system are introduced as below.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The crucial function of dataplane is to forward packets in-line with the native Linux wireless MAC80211 network stack and to provide programming primitives to control packet forwarding. To enable programmable packet forwarding on wireless multi-hop networks, we leveraged Openflow-based Datapath to send and receive data packets. Our datapath is developed using Openflow Software switch, namely Ofsoftswitch13 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Dataplane functionality is pivotal for realizing AI-enabled forwarding schemes. Nowadays, dataplanes are not only designed to handle packet forwarding, but they also gather vast amount of data for network monitoring using SNMP, sFLOW, Collectd, and many more. However, existing solutions do not support actionable data sampling or measurement schemes that can be rapidly exploited for routing schemes with delay minimization as the objective. In addition, they require additional channel resources and fail to capture real-time delay of packets.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With an AI-enabled platform as the core of our system design, we proposed and developed a real-time in-band network telemetry module. The primary objective of our telemetry solution is to collect real-time experience of packets, such as per-hop delay over each traversing link or end-to-end link, in a cost-efficient manner. Towards this end, we have developed and implemented a distributed in-band telemetry system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, where each router runs its own telemetry module built on the top of OpenFlow processing pipeline. Our in-band telemetry system consists of a new telemetry packet header, two new packet matching actions (i.e., PUSHINTL and POPINTL) and the telemetry processor. To assist AI-enabled federated networking, we reconfigure the telemetry processor so that whenever a FL packet passes through the router, the router will recognize such packet and insert a timestamp (i.e., the time instance when FL packet arrives at the router) into the telemetry packet header. Then, by using the PUSHINTL action, the router performs packet encapsulation by adding the telemetry packet header into the FL packet. After receiving such FL packet, the next-hop router decapsulates the FL packet via POPINTL action and retrieves the timestamp. The difference between the timestamps of the sending router and receiving router is the one-hop packet delivery delay. The key advantage of our in-band telemetry is that the routers are able to use data packets to carry measurement data with minimum cost, where the measurement data or experience are the keys for training RL agents. In this work, the in-band telemetry system is tested and optimized so that the extra delay induced by the telemetry processing operations is negligible.</p>

We have extended programmability to control PHY using NetLink interface from the controller. Each RF hardware on the router is attached as a virtual port on the datapath and link layer discovery such as neighbor peering is handled by MAC80211 stack.</p>

Telemetry manager instructs and gathers the packet flow monitoring metrics from the telemetry enabled datapath.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">RL routing solution is developed as a network application that can access and pass messages using core services REST API. For example, to implement an Actor/Critic RL algorithm, the first step is to build the Q-table based on the local topology information retrieved from the network state database as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-C2 Network Core Services ‣ IV-C Federated Networking ‣ IV FedEdge Design and Prototyping ‣ EdgeML: Towards Network-Accelerated Federated Learning over Wireless Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. Following this, we can initiate the Q-table using the estimated Q-values stored in the database. Besides the Q table, we can also adopt neural networks for non-linear Q value approximations especially when more network states are utilized, such as traffic matrix and queue lengths. We will incorporate Q approximation neural networks function in the future work. Actor, on the other hand, disseminates the routing control decisions following the critics and policy <math id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pi" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">π</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\pi</annotation></semantics></math> to the OpenFlow manager. OpenFlow manager translates the RL decisions into actionable OpenFlow datapath instructions for orchestrating the packet forwarding behavior. To accelerate the RL policy convergence, the loop-free action space is calculated by the action space refining application (introduced in section III.C). This application is running on the network controller, which has the global network topology readily available via the topology discovery module. Our topology discovery module can operate in either a centralized or distributed manner. The centralized approach directly uses the link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) that is initialized and coordinated by the network controller. For the distributed approach, each router discovers its one-hop neighbors via IEEE 802.11 local topology discovery scheme and the local typologies from all the routers are then aggregated by the network controller to form the global topology. It is worthy to note that both the network controller and wireless routers employ the same federated network subsystem shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A FedEdge Overall Design ‣ IV FedEdge Design and Prototyping ‣ EdgeML: Towards Network-Accelerated Federated Learning over Wireless Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, except that the network controller runs an additional action space refining application.</p>

This testbed consists of 10 Nvidia Jetson Xavier nodes, each of which is connected to one Gateway 5400 multi-radio wireless router. Each Nvidia Jetson node serves as federated computing node which handles the federated learning training. In addition, the network core and RL-app of federated networking subsystem are also hosted on Nvidia Jetson node. On the other hand, Gateworks routers serve as federated networking node that only hosts a dataplane submodule. The dataplane is orchestrated using OpenFlow protocol by the network core services hosted on Nvidia jetson node. Such decoupled system design allows resource-rich Nvidia nodes to handle the computation-intensive FL operations and RL-based networking intelligence while keeping the operations of resource-limited routers simple and fast.</p>

In our testbed, we deployed Ubuntu 20.04 as the operating system and 3 x Compex WLE900VX-I wireless cards to enable multi-radio wireless nodes. Each wireless radio is set to operate on 5 Ghz channels and 20 Mhz channel width in 802.11ac operating mode with 15 dBm transmission power. As a result, each wireless router in our testbed can reach roughly 40 Mbps aggregated data rate from three radio cards. On top of the node operating system, we deploy a dataplane submodule that facilitates a software bridge with a programmable packet handling routine (i.e OpenFlow Flowtable). All three wireless cards were configured to operate on disjoint channels, and then they were added to OpenFlow bridge as OpenFlow ports. Since our router is embedded hardware with limited computation power and cpu cores, the timley availability of CPU processing cycle is essential for seamless performance. Hence, in our testbed, we explicitly define CPU cores for the OpenFlow process by using Linux <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Taskset</span> functionality.</p>

Jetson nodes come with Ubuntu 20.04 operating systems and TensorFlow packages as part of the hardware. In our testbed, each jetson node can host different number of FL worker nodes. Since the primary goal of our experiment is to study the impact of wireless networking on FL, we enabled isolation only at the network level using network namespace. The main advantage of such approach is that, within the single hardware we can deploy multiple workers with isolated TCP/IP layer.

On each jetson node, we create a virtual bridge using Linux brigde-utils and then we create namespaces for each worker. Following that, the interfaces from the namespace is added to the newly created bridge using virtual ethernet pairing. At this point, all workers within each jetson node can communicate independently. To facilitate external connectivity, nodes master ethernet interface is also added to the same bridge. Finally, each worker can be launched from their respective namespace by executing the API scripts.</p>

BATMAN-adv is implemented as a layer 2 proactive routing protocol based on distance vector and radio link based reliability as the routing metric. In addition, each node only maintains route information to the next node by which the final destination can be reached. Since each node only requires next hop information towards the destination node, global exchange of routing information is not necessary. From the aforementioned operation of BATMAN-adv, we identified it as the best candidate for comparison as the operation of our RL routing scheme also utilizes only next hop nodes information. Moreover, to the best our knowledge, BATMAN-Adv is the only multi-radio mesh routing protocol that works out of the box on Linux systems as it is embedded within the Linux kernel for optimized operation. During the experiments, we directly use the production-grade BATMAN-Adv protocol provided by Linux system.</p>

Such heterogeneous setup will lead to model divergence because of varying number of local updates by workers.

In addition, wall clock time is significantly reduced by 50 minutes when RL algorithms is used for routing even in presence of stragglers. By applying regularized SGD, better convergence performance can be observed when the number of training epochs increases, even though at the initial training stage, regularized SGD converges slower than the classic SGD.</p>

We study the total FL convergence time, FL computing time, and FL networking time by varying the number of workers that are connected to the three edge routers (R9, R10, R2). We study three node distributions (3-3-3, 2-5-2, 2-4-3) with a total number of 9 workers. It is evident that the RL-based federated networking can consistently outperform the baseline networking protocol under different node distributions and achieve up to 25% convergence speedup, compared with the baseline. Moreover, when the network becomes congested, RL-based federated networking protocols lead to a higher performance gain because they can learn to maximize the network resource utilization to better distribute FL flows among all available forwarding paths. This advantage is shown under 2-5-2 worker distribution, where the router R10 needs to serve 5 workers, which induces higher FL traffic volume and a higher level of network congestion around router R10. In this case, on-policy softmax policy leads to the 25% speedup, which is the maximum one among the three node distributions. Regarding RL-based approaches, on-policy softmax outperforms on-policy greedy for all three cases. This is due to the fact that on-policy softmax can proportionally distribute the traffic flows among the available forwarding paths according to the E2E delay of each path. Such approach could be more effective to distribute the traffic loads. In addition, it is observed that the majority of total run time came from communication time while the computation time (around 8 minutes) only contributes to a small portion of the total training time. Therefore, optimizing the federated networking performance is very beneficial to accelerate FL convergence in multi-hop edge computing networks.</p>

As the number of workers increases, the convergence time of both RL-based approach and baseline protocol increases.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes network-accelerated FL over wireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. We first formulate the FL convergence optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, we propose the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MA-RL) algorithm along with loop-free action space refining schemes so that the delay-minimum forwarding paths are learned to minimize the model exchange latency between edge workers and the aggregator. To fast prototype, deploy, and evaluate our proposed FL solutions, we develop FedEdge, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL over multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. Moreover, we deploy and implement a physical experimental testbed on the top of the widely adopted Linux wireless routers and ML computing nodes. Such testbed can provide valuable insights into the practical performance of FL in the field. Finally, our experimentation results show that our RL-empowered network-accelerated FL system can significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL systems enabled by the production-grade commercially-available wireless networking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.</p>
