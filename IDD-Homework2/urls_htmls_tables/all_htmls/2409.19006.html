<p class="ltx_p" id="id13.id1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id13.id1.1">“Patents are the currency of innovation, and like any currency, they need to be managed and protected”</span> (Gavin Potenza). Patents, as legal documents that secure intellectual property rights, play a critical role in technological innovation. The growing complexity of patent documents and the surge in patent applications have created a need for automated solutions in patent analysis. In this work, we present <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id13.id1.2">PatExpert</span>, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework designed to streamline and optimize patent-related tasks. The framework consists of a meta-agent that coordinates task-specific expert agents for various patent-related tasks and a critique agent for error handling and feedback provision. The meta-agent orchestrates specialized expert agents, each fine-tuned for specific tasks such as patent classification, acceptance, claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For multi-patent analysis, the framework incorporates advanced methods like Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to enhance response accuracy and relevance by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs. Error handling is managed by critique agents (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge), which evaluate output responses for accuracy and provide iterative feedback. The framework also prioritizes explainability, ensuring transparent justifications for decisions made during patent analysis. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a valuable tool for automating complex patent workflows, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in patent-related tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in patent processing tasks, concluding that the framework offers a robust solution for automating and optimizing patent analysis.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.1">“An invention is something that was ‘impossible’ up to then; that’s why governments grant patents.”</span> (Robert A. Heinlein). A patent is a legal document that grants the inventor exclusive rights to make, use, and sell their invention for a specified period in exchange for public disclosure of the invention’s details. Patent documents are essential for securing intellectual property rights and serve as a public record of technological innovation. While these documents may vary slightly by jurisdiction (e.g., USPTO, JPO, EPO), they generally consist of several key sections that ensure both legal protection and clear communication of the invention. A patent typically includes a title, abstract, background, summary, detailed description, claims, and illustrations. The title highlights the invention’s main innovation, while the abstract provides a brief overview of the invention, focusing on its purpose, key features, and potential applications. The background section outlines existing solutions and the technical challenges the invention addresses. The detailed description provides in-depth technical specifications, including various embodiments (specific versions or implementations of the invention), processes (methods or procedures involved in making or using the invention), and use cases (practical applications or scenarios where the invention could be applied), explaining how the invention addresses the identified challenges. The claims accurately determine the scope of legal protection, outlining the legal boundaries of coverage. These claims can be independent, broadly covering the core features, or dependent, refining the scope by specifying particular embodiments. Other important sections include patent classification codes, citations to prior art, and illustrations accompanied by detailed descriptions that visually depict key aspects of the invention, aiding in the understanding of complex technical details. Collectively, these main sections ensure that the patent document meets legal requirements, communicates the invention effectively, and provides enforceable rights to the inventor. This emphasizes the necessity for precision and clarity in patent drafting to ensure it withstands legal scrutiny and future challenges. In recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI GPT-4<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite> and Google Gemini<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, have excelled in natural language processing tasks due to their proficiency in pattern recognition, contextual understanding, and generating coherent language based on learned data distributions. However, their application to patent-related tasks remains underexplored. Patents, as complex legal documents that protect intellectual property, combine technical information, requiring a deep understanding of the subject matter and precise language to describe complex, domain-specific concepts. Additionally, the rise in patent applications and the increasing difficulty of manual processing have created a growing need for LLMs to automate patent-related workflows. LLMs can enhance patent analysis, knowledge extraction, and document generation, transforming both the analysis and generation of patent content. In patent analysis, LLMs excel at automating the categorization of patents into relevant classes and subclasses based on their subject matter and technological field. For quality assessment, LLMs can evaluate patent novelty by comparing new patents against prior art, estimate the likelihood of approval based on historical data, and predict potential litigation by analyzing claim strength and market relevance. In multilingual translation, they maintain precise technical meanings across languages. In open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks, LLMs using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>) approach, efficiently retrieve and synthesize technical details, claims, and legal information from patents, producing more accurate and grounded responses. Their advanced contextual understanding, combined with few-shot learning, enables them to adapt to new patents and extract precise information for ODQA tasks. Additionally, fine-tuning on domain-specific patents enhances their ability to recognize patterns unique to these tasks, resulting in the generation of detailed, context-relevant answers. This capability extends to more specialized tasks, such as extracting scientific hypotheses from patents, where LLMs support the identification of key scientific concepts, implicit assumptions, and underlying principles of the patented technology. This helps form testable hypotheses that may guide future research and innovation. For new patents, LLMs support the drafting process by generating sections such as descriptions and claims, ensuring the protection of a unique invention through adherence to strict legal requirements. These applications enhance efficiency, democratize access to patent information, and accelerate innovation. However, patent texts present unique challenges for general-purpose language models, such as specialized terminology, long contexts, and the need to generate precise and accurate text, setting them apart from conventional texts. Integrating LLMs into the patent process requires careful consideration of legal, ethical, and quality assurance aspects to ensure the integrity and fairness of the patent workflow. In this work, we present an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.p1.1.2">PatExpert</span>) for patent analysis, orchestrated by a meta-agent (top-level agent) that coordinates multiple expert agents (sub-agents), offering a transformative solution for managing patent-related tasks with precision and efficiency. The meta-agent interprets user input, decomposes the complex workflow of patent processing into specialized sub-tasks, and delegates them to task-specific expert agents. Each expert agent is fine-tuned to handle specific patent-related tasks, enhancing both accuracy and relevance. Once an expert agent completes its assigned task, it routes the response back to the meta-agent, which synthesizes the information and provides the final output. By orchestrating collaboration among expert agents, the meta-agent integrates technical expertise with legal considerations, optimizing a wide range of tasks, including patent acceptance prediction, classification, abstractive summarization, claim generation, multi-patent analysis for ODQA tasks, and generating scientific hypotheses from patents. The collaborative problem-solving between the meta-agent and expert agents enhances the management of patent-related tasks, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and compliance in handling complex challenges. Scientific hypothesis generation from patents, supported by subject-action-object (SAO) analysis, identifies implicit assumptions and core principles, enabling researchers to extract testable ideas and enhance the analysis of patent novelty and technical capabilities. Multi-patent analysis compares claims, technical details, and prior art across multiple patents to reveal novel aspects and streamline patent processing for efficient comparison and question answering. For question answering in multi-patent analysis, the expert agent uses Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to improve information extraction by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs, which helps in generating more accurate answers. Error handling is an integral component of the framework, managed by a critique agent (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge). The critique agent evaluates outputs from the meta-agent using predefined metrics, assessing accuracy and providing feedback for iterative refinement. This feedback loop ensures that outputs are accurate, reducing the risk of inaccuracies. The multi-agent framework, equipped with error-handling mechanisms, offers a comprehensive solution for automating and optimizing complex patent analysis. The framework prioritizes explainability and transparency, with each expert agent providing clear explanations and justifications for its predictions to ensure that the rationale behind every decision is accessible and comprehensible. This approach enhances user trust and facilitates the interpretation of complex patent-related task outputs, such as patent acceptance and claim generation. For multi-patent analysis tasks, the framework is equipped with robust fact-checking and source citation capabilities, ensuring that responses are accurate and supported by reliable evidence. Its ability to effectively retrieve and organize information from structured graph databases allows it to synthesize clear, well-substantiated answers. This makes the framework an invaluable tool for patent analysis and decision-making, especially when handling queries that demand detailed, referenced information.

The figure shows the architecture of the multi-agent conversational framework, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.F1.4.1">PatExpert</span>. The meta-agent oversees various sub-agents, each responsible for specialized tasks such as patent classification, acceptance prediction, claim generation, abstractive summarization, hypothesis generation, and multi-patent analysis. User input flows through the meta-agent (which utilizes Meta-Llama-3.1-405B to interpret user queries), delegating tasks to the relevant sub-agents (using fine-tuned GPT-4o mini) to provide accurate responses. Critique agents, including the Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge (Nvidia Nemotron-4-340B-Reward) and LLM-as-a-Judge (OpenAI GPT-4o), evaluate the outputs for accuracy. These agents provide critical feedback to refine responses, ensuring that the framework adheres to high standards of precision, compliance, and quality in patent-related tasks. The knowledge graph stores structured information extracted from patents, while the conversational database holds historical interactions, helping the framework maintain context and continuity in multi-turn queries. The knowledge graph enables efficient semantic retrieval across multiple patents for ODQA tasks, improving response accuracy. In summary, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S1.F1.5.2">PatExpert</span> handles complex patent-related tasks and generates accurate, coherent responses through its structured, multi-agent framework.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.27">The <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S2.p1.27.1">PatExpert</span> framework utilizes tool learning, where a meta-agent interacts with sub-agents (tools or expert models), each specializing in a specific patent-related task. This enhances the framework’s ability to efficiently solve complex patent tasks by leveraging specialized models. In this paper, "tools" and "expert models" are used interchangeably to refer to the sub-agents that the meta-agent interacts with to perform specific patent-related tasks. Powered by computational engines like Meta-Llama-3.1-405B, the meta-agent serves as the central orchestrator, managing expert models (e.g., utilizing GPT-4o-mini) with precision. It autonomously addresses patent-related tasks by interpreting complex queries, reasoning, and planning—i.e., determining the step-by-step (multistep) approach and expert models required to solve the task—and utilizing expert models to generate accurate, coherent responses. By learning to select and apply the appropriate expert models, the meta-agent can perform tasks beyond its pre-trained knowledge. This approach improves response accuracy and relevance, making the framework more adaptable to real-world applications. Each expert model specializes in unique tasks such as patent acceptance prediction, automated subject classification (IPC/CPC code prediction), abstractive summarization, patent claim generation, scientific hypothesis generation, and multi-patent analysis for ODQA tasks. Each expert model is fine-tuned for optimal performance in its specific task, allowing the meta-agent to dynamically select and invoke the most suitable expert model for each sub-task in the overall patent evaluation and processing workflow. The framework transforms the meta-agent into a multi-tool user capable of managing complex patent-related tasks by autonomously planning and executing sequences of expert model invocations with appropriate arguments to solve a natural language task <math alttext="Q" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑄</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">Q</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1d">italic_Q</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p7.1">This iterative process ensures that the response is refined to meet the required criteria before being finalized. In summary, the meta-agent efficiently solves complex patent-related tasks by invoking appropriate expert models, managing task dependencies, and synthesizing outputs into a coherent response. This approach ensures dynamic handling of intricate patent queries. The meta-agent also incorporates an error-handling mechanism to enhance performance in patent-related tasks. After generating responses, it delegates the output to an external critique agent, which reviews and evaluates the quality of the responses, providing feedback and revisions as needed to ensure that the final answers are accurate, relevant, and aligned with the query requirements. The proposed approach utilizes synthetic datasets for Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to enhance the performance of a related sub-agent in ODQA tasks for multi-patent analysis. During inference, Knowledge graphs support accurate, knowledge-grounded responses during multi-patent analysis. See technical appendix for details.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS1.p1.1">We utilized the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset (HUPD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>), a large-scale, well-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of english-language patent applications filed with the USPTO between 2004 and 2018. With over 4.5 million patent documents, HUPD is significantly larger than comparable datasets (BIGPATENT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>, CLEF-IP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>, USPTO-2M <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite>). Unlike other datasets that focus solely on granted patents, HUPD includes both accepted and rejected filings, providing opportunities to study the decision-making process for patent acceptance. In summary, the HUPD dataset serves as a versatile resource for advancing research in patent analysis and NLP, with applications such as patent acceptance prediction, classification, abstractive summarization, claim generation, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For our experiments, we utilized patent data from only two years (2015-2017) (<a class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HUPD/hupd" title="">https://huggingface.co/datasets/HUPD/hupd</a>), which was split in an 80-10-10 ratio for training, validation, and testing. We report the framework’s performance on the unseen test set.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.p1.1">In this work, chaining experiments for patent-related tasks involves a sequential process where specific sections of patent documents feed into each task, creating a streamlined workflow that enhances efficiency and accuracy. For patent summarization utilizes the title, abstract, background, and description to generate concise overviews, highlighting key technical details. For claim generation, the framework uses the title, abstract, background, summary, and description to automatically generate precise legal claims that reflect the patent’s technical contributions. For patent classification and acceptance prediction, sections such as the title, abstract, background, summary, patent claims are analyzed by the framework to categorize patents by their technological domain and predict acceptance. Scientific hypothesis generation draws on the title, abstract, background, summary, descriptions and patent claims to identify assumptions and generate hypotheses about the patent’s innovations. Multi-patent analysis leverages the title, abstract, background, summary, description, and claims from multiple patents to perform comparative analysis, using knowledge graphs to organize and retrieve information, facilitating the extraction of trends and relationships. This interconnected process ensures each task is optimized, streamlining patent analysis. Summary section in granted patents written by experts serve as ground truth. For claim generation, the legal claims in granted patents can serve as reference text. Ground truth for hypothesis generation can be based on expert-curated (Gold-LLMs like GPT-4o) hypotheses extracted from patent documents. Ground truth for multi-patent analysis can be created by benchmarking against expert (Gold-LLMs such as GPT-4o) analyses of trends, relationships, and innovations across patents. In our work, we fine-tune expert models like GPT-4o mini using datasets tailored to patent-related tasks. GPT-4o mini can be fine-tuned (see: <a class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter" href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/" title="">https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/</a>, <a class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning" title="">https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning</a>) on OpenAI’s servers using domain-specific datasets. This process is facilitated through OpenAI’s APIs, where users upload datasets, define hyperparameters, and initiate fine-tuning. The server-side infrastructure ensures that users do not need to manage hardware or computational resources, making GPT-4o mini easily accessible for various applications via OpenAI’s API platform. Fine-tuning requires adjusting key hyperparameters such as the learning rate (<math alttext="1e^{-5}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">⁢</mo><msup id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">e</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">5</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑒</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">5</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">1e^{-5}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1d">1 italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math>), batch size (32), and number of epochs (100).

Precision is the proportion of correctly predicted positives to total predicted positives, and recall is the proportion of correctly predicted positives to all actual positives. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of response generation, with higher values indicating better performance. We utilize the Exact Match (EM) metric for both classification and acceptance prediction tasks. The F1 score for patent acceptance prediction. Precision in acceptance prediction measures how many patents predicted as "accepted" were actually accepted, while Recall measures how many of the actual accepted patents were correctly predicted. For patent claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis for ODQA, and scientific hypothesis generation, the evaluation metrics used are BLEU and ROUGE-L. BLEU measures n-gram precision, and ROUGE-L evaluates the longest common subsequence to assess content overlap. These metrics ensure that generated outputs are accurate, relevant, and aligned with reference texts across all tasks.</p>

In our experiments, baseline results for closed-source models like OpenAI GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 were obtained without fine-tuning, given the impracticality of such an approach due to their large size and resource demands on consumer hardware. These proprietary models, accessed via their APIs, were evaluated directly on patent-related tasks without additional tuning. In contrast, our proposed framework <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.4">PatExpert</span> employs a fine-tuning strategy for the computational engines utilized by expert sub-agents, such as GPT-4o mini, customizing them for specific patent-related tasks. This fine-tuning enables the framework to achieve higher task-specific accuracy and relevance, especially in complex scenarios requiring patent expertise. While the frozen baseline models generally perform well due to their large-scale pre-training, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.5">PatExpert</span>’s fine-tuned agents demonstrate competitive results, especially in specialized patent workflows. This highlights the benefit of task-specific fine-tuning in improving expert model performance for domain-specific applications. Across all tables, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.6">PatExpert</span> consistently outperforms other models, achieving the highest scores in task planning, tool selection, and tool calling metrics. It leads with a TUA of 0.94, Acc of 0.91, and DGC of 0.95, reflecting its superior ability to recognize tools and maintain task consistency. In tool selection, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.7">PatExpert</span> also excels with a Recall@K of 0.95 and an NDCG@K of 0.93, demonstrating high accuracy in selecting and ranking relevant tools. Finally, in tool calling, it shows exceptional performance with a PC of 0.95 and an EA of 0.96, along with the lowest ER of 0.04, indicating minimal errors and high execution accuracy. OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus follow closely in all metrics, while models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash perform moderately.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">In this work, we introduce <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.p1.1.1">PatExpert</span>, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework for automating and optimizing patent-related tasks, including classification, acceptance prediction, claim generation, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. The framework employs a meta-agent to orchestrate task-specific expert agents, dynamically selecting and invoking them based on task requirements. This approach enhances patent workflows’ efficiency and accuracy while emphasizing explainability and transparency. The integration of a critique agent, utilizing Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge, ensures robust error handling and iterative feedback, contributing to the framework’s reliability. Advanced methodologies such as Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) and synthetic data generation using the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach have improved Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) of expert models for multi-patent analysis. Empirical results show that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S4.p1.1.2">PatExpert</span> improves efficiency and precision in patent processing, reducing manual effort and enhancing compliance. Future work will expand the framework’s capabilities to handle multilingual processing and patent translation.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS0.SSS1.p1.1">The user-centric evaluation (UCE) approach for assessing tool learning frameworks (with a focus only on multi-patent analysis) includes various measures for a comprehensive assessment. User satisfaction and usability are gauged through Likert-scale surveys (LSS), with scores ranging from 1 to 5. Task completion (TC) is evaluated using a binary Yes/No metric. Context awareness (CA) is measured by evaluating the framework’s coherence across related queries, while adaptability (AD) is tested using various query types, both rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Error handling (EH) is assessed by introducing deliberate errors and scoring the framework’s response from 1 to 5. Additionally, qualitative feedback (QF) is gathered and categorized as High, Medium-High, or Medium, providing nuanced insights. This multi-faceted UCE approach offers a holistic view of the framework’s effectiveness, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement to better meet user needs and expectations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS0.SSS2.p1.1">In this work, we utilize Gold-LLMs like GPT-4o to extract entities and relationships from unstructured text, enabling automated taxonomy creation and ontology expansion. By identifying key concepts and connections, Gold-LLMs help build comprehensive knowledge graphs. To evaluate a constructed knowledge graph, we use several metrics. These evaluation metrics are crucial for maintaining the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the knowledge graph, particularly in applications like semantic search, information retrieval, and data integration. Triple Accuracy (TA) ensures that subject-predicate-object triples correctly represent the underlying knowledge, validated against ground truth by calculating the percentage of exact matches. For ground truth, we use claude 3.5 Sonnet to construct baseline knowledge graphs (KGs). For entity coherence, we use clustering metrics like modularity and conductance. Modularity evaluates how well a graph is divided into clusters; a higher score indicates that nodes within the same cluster are densely connected, while connections between clusters are sparse. Conductance measures cluster quality by comparing the number of external to internal edges, with lower values suggesting more cohesive clusters. Graph Completeness (GC) evaluates whether the graph covers all relevant entities and relationships, identifying gaps or missing connections. It is calculated as the ratio of entities and relationships in the generated graph to a reference. TA ranges from 0% (no correct triples) to 100% (all triples match the ground truth). Modularity (Mod) spans from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating strong clustering and values closer to -1 or 0 suggesting poor clustering. Conductance (Cond) ranges from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating more cohesive clusters. GC ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating full coverage of all relevant entities and relationships.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS1.p1.1">Multi-patent analysis involves examining and comparing multiple patents to identify trends, relationships, and insights across innovations or technologies. General-purpose LLMs using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are not inherently equipped to incorporate external information in open-domain question answering (ODQA) to ground responses in factual data for patent-related tasks. We propose a methodology to enhance LLMs performance in ODQA for multi-patent analysis tasks by utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) methodology. RAFT integrates dynamically retrieved content during fine-tuning, improving LLMs ability to generate accurate, context-grounded responses. Our approach includes generating high-quality synthetic RAFT datasets (question-context-answer (QCA) triples) tailored for patents using a multi-step pipeline involving the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) methodology, where multiple Gold-LLMs collaborate to generate contextually accurate answers. Quality evaluation techniques ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the synthetic RAFT dataset. The expert model for the multi-patent analysis task is fine-tuned on the synthetic dataset, enabling it to produce more accurate responses. Additionally, we construct a knowledge graph from patent documents to facilitate efficient semantic search and retrieval of relevant information. During inference, the expert model accesses the knowledge graph to provide auxiliary context, generating coherent, grounded, and accurate responses to complex patent-related queries. In the following sections, we discuss the synthetic data generation process, including the creation of question-context-answer (QCA) triples, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach, and quality evaluation techniques. We also cover the integration of the knowledge graph and its impact on improving the expert model’s performance in patent analysis tasks during inference.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS1.SSS1.p1.5">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>) provides LLMs with relevant external information from document databases, enabling them to generate outputs that are more contextually accurate, detailed, and grounded for ODQA tasks. This approach helps overcome the limitations of static, pre-trained knowledge in LLMs. In traditional RAG, documents are parsed and processed to extract text, then divided into smaller chunks using fixed-size chunking strategies to facilitate more precise retrieval of relevant content. Each chunk is embedded into a low-dimensional dense vector space that captures its semantic content, allowing for efficient indexing and retrieval of relevant chunks in response to queries. This method enhances generation by conditioning the language model on retrieved, contextually relevant chunks, leading to more accurate and grounded outputs. However, traditional RAG methods face several challenges that limit their effectiveness. These methods primarily rely on small text chunks, requiring the retriever to search through a large database to find relevant information. This can be inefficient, as the retriever often needs to recall numerous text chunks, sometimes necessitating re-ranking to optimize performance. Moreover, small text chunks can lead to semantic incompleteness and the loss of critical details due to document truncation. Dividing crucial context or concepts into multiple segments can impair coherence. Choosing an optimal chunk size is challenging: if chunks are too small, context is lost; if they are too large, retrieval becomes less precise—clearly, one size does not fit all. General-purpose LLMs are typically pre-trained on large text corpora using self-supervised learning techniques, such as predicting the next word in a sentence (autoregressive models) or filling in masked tokens (masked language models). To adapt LLMs for specific tasks, they undergo fine-tuning on task-specific datasets, enhancing their ability to follow instructions, improve contextual understanding, and solve complex problems. Despite these advancements, LLMs are generally not pre-trained or fine-tuned to inherently incorporate external retrieved context from databases, which is crucial for generating more accurate answers in ODQA. To address these limitations, the Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>) methodology optimizes LLMs to integrate retrieved content from external databases during fine-tuning. This approach enables language models to combine their internal parametric knowledge with dynamically retrieved external information, allowing for accurate and grounded responses in ODQA tasks. RAFT effectively overcomes the limitations of LLMs having only limited pre-trained, task-specific knowledge and their inability to utilize relevant external information from databases. However, synthetic RAFT datasets tailored for patent-related tasks are not readily available and require custom creation. To overcome these challenges, we employ a meticulous multi-step approach involving synthetic data generation and validation through a custom pipeline that creates high-quality RAFT datasets for fine-tuning LLMs to utilize relevant external information in patent-related ODQA tasks. It also filters out lower-quality instances to ensure robustness, employing both a ‘Reward-LLM-as-Judge‘ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite> and ‘LLM-as-a-Judge‘ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite> approach based on quality evaluation metrics. The RAFT dataset includes questions and relevant context retrieved from documents, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning-based answers.
For each text chunk of a patent document, we generate multiple questions using Gold-LLMs. We apply the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>) methodology to synthesize information from both the text chunks and relevant text chunks retrieved from patent databases by a retriever, generating contextually accurate answers to the questions.
The MoA framework leverages the strengths of multiple Gold-LLMs within a layered architecture, enhancing natural language understanding and generation by incorporating outputs from other language models as additional context through collaborative synthesis.

In the final layer, a single, more capable Gold-LLM aggregates and synthesizes the outputs from the previous layers to generate a coherent, high-quality response. In the MoA technique, Gold-LLMs function either as proposers, generating diverse, context-rich responses, or as aggregators, synthesizing these into comprehensive outputs. Our implementation uses the LLaMA-3.1-405B-instruct and NemoTron-4-340B-instruct models as proposers, with GPT-4 Turbo serving as the aggregator. The architecture consists of two layers, each with two proposers and one aggregator working together to produce a coherent response. We utilize the ‘Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge’, such as the multidimensional Nvidia NemoTron-4-340B-Reward model, to evaluate the quality of the question-answer pairs, focusing on attributes such as helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity. Additionally, we utilize ‘LLM-as-a-Judge’, with GPT-4o acting as an expert judge to evaluate answers by rating them on relevance, accuracy, faithfulness, and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. At each layer, structured feedback from both the ‘Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge’ and ‘LLM-as-a-Judge’ models drives iterative refinement without fine-tuning, relying solely on prompting and generation to enhance response quality. In summary, the synthetic data generation pipeline operates by ingesting documents, generating diverse questions covering various scenarios and contexts, and using the MoA architecture to produce detailed, contextually relevant answers to fine-tune the expert model for multi-patent analysis. Our method then employs knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from teacher models (LLaMA-3.1-405B-instruct, NemoTron-4-340B-instruct, GPT-4 Turbo) to a student model (GPT-4o mini), enabling the student model to replicate the larger model’s outputs and behaviors through instruction-tuning on synthetic RAFT datasets. We fine-tune the expert model (i.e., GPT-4o mini) on the multi-patent analysis task using synthetic RAFT datasets generated from the MoA framework. During inference, the relevant context related to the end-user question is retrieved from the knowledge graph database (discussed in Subsection <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#A1.SS1.SSS2" title="A.1.2 Knowledge Graph Modeling for Semantic Search and Retrieval ‣ A.1 Multi-Patent Analysis ‣ Appendix A Appendix / supplemental material ‣ Towards Automated Patent Workflows: AI-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework for Intellectual Property Management and Analysis"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.1.2</span></a>), enhancing the expert model for multi-patent analysis response generation and resulting in coherent, knowledge-grounded, and accurate answers.

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS1.SSS2.p1.6">In Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>), structured information is extracted from unstructured documents using parsing techniques and integrated into a knowledge graph. This facilitates efficient indexing and retrieval of contextually relevant content from knowledge graphs, enhancing language models for better performance in ODQA tasks. The process begins with parsing documents to extract structured data, such as text. This information is then integrated into graph databases such as Neo4j Aura, Amazon Neptune, or NebulaGraph, which are designed for storing and querying graph data. These databases organize the information into nodes and relationships within property graphs, preserving contextual and semantic information. The graph database enables efficient querying of property graphs, leading to more accurate responses compared to traditional keyword-based searches. Traditional RAG approaches rely on unstructured, plain-text retrieval, which has limitations when dealing with complex queries that require the integration of multiple, possibly disparate, text segments. In contrast, Graph RAG builds and utilizes a knowledge graph where entities and their relationships are explicitly modeled. This graph-based representation allows for better capturing and leveraging the underlying structure of the extracted data from documents, enhancing knowledge retrieval by enabling graph traversal structured by a schema and guided by an ontology. The vector semantic similarity search technique converts graph-structured data and queries into vector embeddings. Based on the similarity of these embeddings in the shared semantic space of the graph database, it retrieves and integrates nodes and relationships that are most relevant, enhancing retrieval accuracy by combining semantic similarity with contextual information. The retrieved information is then processed by a language model to generate accurate and contextually rich responses to complex queries. We lay the groundwork for constructing a knowledge graph by chunking text, embedding chunks, and extracting triples—data structures consisting of a subject, predicate, and object that represent relationships between entities—for efficient querying and retrieval. Text chunking involves breaking large documents into smaller, manageable segments, referred to as chunks, to enhance processing efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Using the sliding window technique, a fixed-size window moves across the text with a set stride, creating overlapping chunks that preserve context.

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS1.SSS2.p9.1">When a query is posed, the knowledge graph is traversed to retrieve relevant nodes and relationships from the graph database and is integrated with the expert model’s pre-existing knowledge to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This approach leverages the expert model’s language generation capabilities while grounding its outputs in structured knowledge, leading to more accurate and informative answers. Entity deduplication in knowledge graphs resolves duplicates, reducing inconsistencies and redundancy. Our approach to entity deduplication integrates advanced techniques such as cosine similarity for vector-based evaluation and Levenshtein distance for string-based comparison, ensuring precise entity matching. For example, in a knowledge graph containing entities like ‘IBM’ and ‘International Business Machines’ or ‘Google LLC’ and ‘Google’, it first identifies these semantically related nodes and groups them into clusters based on overlapping characteristics. It then filters and merges these clusters, prioritizing the preservation of essential properties while eliminating redundancy. This process results in an optimized, deduplicated graph structure, enhancing the graph’s effectiveness for knowledge extraction from unstructured documents and semantic search. The improved structure facilitates better contextual retrieval, leading to more accurate responses. In the specific domain of cross-document knowledge integration, a unified knowledge graph created from multiple patents, supported by LLM-driven ontology extraction and schema alignment, effectively organizes and standardizes patent data, enabling precise exploration, easier identification of trends and gaps, and promoting faster, data-driven innovation. In summary, transforming documents into structured knowledge graphs enables efficient, context-aware retrieval of information from unstructured data, enhancing the framework’s ability to reason and generate relevant solutions for complex patent-related tasks, thereby improving efficiency in Q&amp;A tasks. Please note: the expert model for multi-patent analysis accesses the KG search engine as a tool.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS2.p1.1">In this work, we employed teacher-student transfer learning via knowledge distillation using Gold-LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to extract or generate scientific hypotheses from granted patents. This process created a synthetic dataset to fine-tune expert models, such as GPT-4o-mini, for the task of patent hypothesis generation. It is important to note that hypothesis generation provides a broader, conceptual explanation of the problem the invention solves and how it works, rather than focusing on legal protection. Patent claims, by contrast, define the specific legal boundaries and technical implementations that the patent protects, emphasizing the structural or procedural aspects of the invention in a precise and formal manner. We utilized Gold-LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to analyze a set of granted patents, extracting Subject-Action-Object (SAO) triplets to uncover the key hypotheses and innovations within the patent documents. The approach began by parsing the granted patents, focusing on key sections such as claims and detailed descriptions, which outline the scope of the patent’s innovation. The Gold-LLM identified and extracted SAO triplets, which are essential for identifying the central technical contributions of the patents. In this context, the subject represents the core invention or technology, the action describes the method or process being applied, and the object defines the outcome or product of the action. The Gold-LLM then synthesized the SAO triplets for each patent, generating a comprehensive hypothesis that represents the innovations and technical contributions of the patents. This hypothesis provides a high-level overview of the key technologies and innovations within each patent, allowing for the identification of unique contributions, and potential advancements. By extracting a hypothesis for each patent, it becomes possible to cross-reference these insights with prior art and technical literature, ensuring that the innovations are novel and consistent with the granted claims. This process enables scalable, automated analysis of patents, streamlining the detection of valuable technological breakthroughs and trends in patent data. We used standard natural language processing (NLP) metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR to compare the generated hypotheses from expert models against reference summaries from Gold LLMs. Table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#A1.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ A.2 Scientific Hypothesis Generation ‣ Appendix A Appendix / supplemental material ‣ Towards Automated Patent Workflows: AI-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework for Intellectual Property Management and Analysis"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> illustrates the hypothesis generation for the Universal Transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.19006v2#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite> patent using a Gold LLM such as GPT-4o.</p>

Unlike traditional Transformers, which fix the depth of computation per sequence element, or LSTMs, which rely on sequential recurrence, the UT’s recurrence in depth allows iterative refinement of representations and dynamic computation, enabling improved generalization to longer sequences and complex algorithmic tasks. This innovation offers computational universality and superior performance on sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation and language modeling, where it consistently surpasses both feed-forward Transformers and LSTMs.</span><span class="ltx_text" id="A1.T10.pic1.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.p4.pic1.2.2.2.1.1.1.2" style="font-size:80%;"></span></span>
