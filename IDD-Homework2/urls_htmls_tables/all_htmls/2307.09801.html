<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph learning refers to a class of methods that use the graph structure for machine learning. Specifically, graph learning uses information such as topology and neighbor relationships of graph structures to perform tasks such as feature learning, classification, and clustering of nodes or edges. Graph learning has a wide range of applications in healthcare<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, social network analysis<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and intelligent transportation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, where the need for data privacy increases as well as the problem of data silos arises. Federated learning(FL) has received attention as a major hot topic in recent years. FL is an emerging distributed machine learning approach that ensures that multiple devices or data centers can collaboratively train a machine model without the data leaving the device or data center. FL leverages data from individual devices or data centers to improve the accuracy and generalization of the model, while also protecting the privacy of user data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Like the classical FL framework, graph-federated learning(GFL) is also based on the FL framework. Currently, FL usually adopts the Client-Server(CS) framework, in which clients compute model parameters locally and upload them to the server, and the server aggregates the model parameters uploaded by each client and distributes them to the clients. One of the most important parts is the model aggregation method, such as FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>(which is based on a weighted average) and Fedprox<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>(which adds regularization terms to the loss function).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the CS framework faces problems such as a single point of failure of the central server and poor scalability of network topology<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Inspired by the blockchain domain, the decentralized framework has better robustness and scalability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Therefore, in this paper, we consider introducing the decentralized framework into GFL. Nevertheless, FL under this framework without centralized control of the server has challenges in designing reasonable interaction mechanisms and effective client-side model aggregation methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose the Decentralized Graph-Federated Learning(DGFL) approach. First, we introduce the decentralized framework to GFL, which consists of fully peer-to-peer learning nodes without a central server. Each node has its own local data, aiming to train GNNs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> models that are more suitable for local data. Second, determine the confidence among nodes based on the similarity of data among nodes, subsequently, the gradient information is then aggregated by linear weighting based on confidence. Finally, the proposed method is compared with FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Fedprox<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, GCFL, and GCFL+<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to verify the effectiveness(accuracy, convergence speed, and computational time) of the proposed method. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) a gradient interaction mechanism is proposed in the framework of decentralized architecture, which greatly reduces the communication overhead while ensuring no inefficiency. (2) introduces the confidence between nodes which is based on a local model gradient sequence and a new model gradient aggregation method based on the confidence for linear weighted aggregation is proposed. (3) experiments conducted on standard graph datasets, and the result of experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms other methods.</p>

Section 3 describes the preliminaries of GNNs and the classic federated aggregation method. Section 4 provides details and the implementation of the proposed approach. Section 5 lists the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. At last, section 6 summarizes the entire article.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning(FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is a distributed machine learning framework that effectively helps multiple nodes or data centers to train models by performing machine learning. The participants of FL mainly consist of a central server and nodes. The server aims to train an optimal model based on the aggregated data of all parties, and the model trained by each node or data center serves local data goals. Importantly, FL allows participants (e.g., smartphones, sensors, mobile devices, servers, etc.) to not share data during the information exchange process so that the user’s raw data remains local to the node or data center throughout the model training process, so FL simultaneously solves the problem of data silos while meeting the requirements of user privacy, data security, and government regulations. FL also reduces the pressure on network bandwidth because the local models are trained on local computers and only the model parameters need to be transmitted. The advantage of the CS framework is that it is easy to manage and easy to implement, and the centralized architecture makes it easier to control, coordinate and monitor. However, its centralized architecture will lead to a single point of failure, and once the server crashes, the whole system will not work properly and has poor scalability.</p>

Under the federated learning system, each data source performs data preprocessing, jointly establishes its learning model, and feeds back the output results to the user. There are two main frameworks in FL:</p>

In this framework, there is a central server, which is responsible for coordinating the computation and communication among the various clients. Specifically, clients download models from the server, then train them using local data and upload the updated models to the server. The server aggregates all the models uploaded by the clients and calculates the average model, which is then sent back to the clients for the next round of training.</p>

<p id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decentralized framework.</span> The decentralized framework eliminates the reliance on a central server, and individual clients can communicate and collaborate directly with each other. In this framework, each client has its own model and uses local data for training, and then sends the updated model to other clients for model aggregation(such as gradient averaging). During model aggregation, clients can verify and monitor each other to ensure security and correctness. The decentralized framework has no single point of failure, each client is independent, and the system is more stable and robust. Data privacy is better because data does not need to be uploaded to the central server. However, the decentralized framework is relatively complex and requires more management and coordination efforts because there is no central server for management and control.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent entities and their relationships, consisting of vertices and edges. Nodes represent entities (such as people, places, or objects), and edges represent relationships between entities (such as friendship, distance, or similarity). Machine learning on graphs is referred to as “graph learning”, and methods used in this field convert graph features to feature vectors of the same dimensionality in the embedding space. Without projecting the graph into a lower dimensional space, a graph learning model or algorithm directly converts graph data into the output of a graph learning architecture. Most graph learning approaches are based on or generalized from deep learning techniques since these techniques can encode and represent graph data as vectors. The objective of graph learning is to extract the desirable features of the graph, and the output vectors are in a continuous space. As a result, downstream activities like node classification and link prediction can employ graph representations with ease without using an explicit embedding procedure. Many graph analysis problems, including link prediction, recommendation, and classification, may be solved quickly and effectively in the representation space thanks to graph learning approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Different facets of social life, including communication patterns, community structures, and information diffusion, are shown by graph network representations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The three kinds of graph learning tasks—vertex-based, edge-based, and subgraph-based—can be separated depending on the characteristics of vertices, edges, and subgraphs. For categorization, risk identification, clustering, and community finding, a graph’s vertex relationships can be leveraged<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. We can do recommendation and knowledge inference by determining whether an edge exists between any two vertices in a network.</p>

Unlike the classical CS framework, without the control of a central server, each local client needs to execute the federated algorithm once in each round of communication as a receiver. In contrast to Cluster Federated Learning (CFL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which also does not rely on the central server to perform clustering, each local client decides its confidence weight based on the local data information and the messages received. Then, clients aggregate the sender’s gradient information received in this round with the local gradient information in this round according to the confidence weight and then update the local gradient information.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Taking the interaction of graph-federated learning based on a decentralized structure into consideration, this paper adopted GIN and a new federated aggregator algorithm, by introducing the proposed algorithm.
Following, we considered four algorithms (i.e., FedAvg, Fedprox, GCFL, and GCFL+), and conducted a set of experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
The experimental results illustrated that the proposed algorithms could achieve graph-federated learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> based on a decentralized structure.
The success of graph learning and federated learning in this area demonstrates its great potential for other applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, heterogeneity of each client’s local data structure (e.g. distributing each client’s different local data from different datasets) and Byzantine problems in communication (e.g. a certain client intentionally sends false information to other clients) will affect the training results.
Therefore, there is still a need to address the problem of working under more dynamic topological conditions.
Furthermore, the success of the proposed algorithm in graph-federated learning based on a decentralized framework shows the potential to be applied to more real-world scenarios, such as medical institutions sharing patient data for model training. In the future, we aim to improve the deficiencies in the proposed algorithm and apply it to more realistic scenarios.
