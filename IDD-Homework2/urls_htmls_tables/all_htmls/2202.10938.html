<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) has recently gained tremendous attention because of its advantages such as decentralization and privacy protection of raw data. However, there has been few research focusing on the allocation of resources for clients in BCFL. In the BCFL framework where the FL clients and the blockchain miners are the same devices, clients broadcast the trained model updates to the blockchain network and then perform mining to generate new blocks. Since each client has a limited amount of computing resources, the problem of allocating computing resources into training and mining needs to be carefully addressed. In this paper, we design an incentive mechanism to assign each client appropriate rewards for training and mining, and then the client will determine the amount of computing power to allocate for each subtask based on these rewards using the two-stage Stackelberg game. After analyzing the utilities of the model owner (MO) (i.e., the BCFL task publisher) and clients, we transform the game model into two optimization problems, which are sequentially solved to derive the optimal strategies for both the MO and clients.
Further, considering the fact that local training related information of each client may not be known by others, we extend the game model with analytical solutions to the incomplete information scenario. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the validity of our proposed schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SINCE its emergence in 2016, federated learning (FL) has been greatly developed and widely applied in many fields, such as Internet of Things <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, smart transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. One of the most important advantages of FL is that there is no transmission of raw data from mobile devices to the centralized server for model training; instead, by training models on local devices (a.k.a., clients) and averaging all local models, FL significantly reduces the possibility of leaking data privacy to a large extent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, there are still some challenges that may restrain the implementation and wide application of FL, e.g., the risk of the single point of failure, malicious attacks from participated clients, and the lack of participation incentives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, researchers resort to blockchain technology to tackle the challenges of FL, where the blockchain system usually works as a decentralized system to provide incentives and data verification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The combination of blockchain and FL is termed as blockchain-based FL (BCFL). In the BCFL framework, model updates submitted by clients will be verified by miners before the global aggregation algorithm is conducted. Once the global model is obtained, it will be updated into the main chain that can be accessed by all qualified participants. Though BCFL can partially address the aforementioned challenges of traditional FL, there are still some remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most critical problems in BCFL is the resource allocation on local devices. Firstly, local devices with heterogeneous computational power usually have their own tasks to finish, so a universal resource allocation scheme for all the mobile devices is not practical. In addition, the whole system may not work effectively and sustainably if there are no reasonable rewards allocated to clients. Furthermore, both training and mining in the framework of BCFL consume significant amount of resources and time, and thus it is difficult for clients to appropriately allocate their limited resources to ensure the performance of the global model during the required time period. Lastly, since the system may not be aware of the amount of training data that each client owns, it can be challenging for the model owner (MO), i.e., the BCFL task publisher, to make proper decisions regarding the reward distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There exist very few studies that tackle the above challenges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The existing studies are based on two assumptions which are not practical: 1) all clients have identical computational power and data volume; and 2) the system knows all the information about clients.
To fill the gap, we propose an incentive mechanism for joint resource allocation on mobile devices in BCFL that is applicable to incomplete information scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the first challenge regarding the unbalanced distribution of resources on mobile devices, we let the clients decide how much computational power they are willing to devote into the training and mining tasks by themselves. By this means, clients can flexibly allocate computation resources for their own tasks. In addition, in our model, training and mining are performed sequentially, and the amount of computational power devoted to these two tasks can be different.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the second challenge of motivating clients to join BCFL, we design an incentive mechanism to reward clients. Training and mining are two different tasks that require different amount of computational power, and thus the rewards should also be different. To ensure a fair distribution of rewards to all clients, we employ the approach of Shapely Value (SV) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to determine the contributions of clients in the training process, which will affect the constraints in their respective optimization problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To address the last two challenges, we build the Stackelberg game model under both the complete and incomplete information situations, which are solved separately but with different insights. Based on the derived optimal solutions, our system can make optimal decisions in different information conditions.</p>

For simplicity, we refer to the work done by the blockchain for FL as <span id="S2.SS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mining</span> in a uniform way, which does not imply that clients perform mining jobs consuming excessive amount of computing power like Proof of Work (PoW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In our system, we consider that lightweight consensus algorithms, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, are utilized in the consortium blockchain system.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our considered BCFL system, each client should be responsible for both training and mining. Since the workflow of the fully coupled BCFL is that mining starts only after the training is completed, we assume that training and mining are not parallel in this paper.
Once the training is finished, all the clients will upload their local model updates to the blockchain network so as to be recorded on the blockchain.
Here we define one round of BCFL as finishing both the training and mining processes.
Since mobile devices usually have their own tasks to finish rather than only contributing to BCFL, we assume that they will not use all of their computation resources. In other words, CPU cycles per second for training and mining can be adjusted strategically in each round of BCFL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The MO is the requester of the FL task, aiming at to receive a well-trained final global model from the BCFL system. After the FL task is published on the blockchain, clients start to train their local models and then broadcast the obtained model updates to the blockchain network once the local training process is finished. By this means, the MO can only access the model updates from all clients rather than raw data of devices, thus preventing the leakage of private information for participants.

What’s more, an incentive mechanism is necessary because clients will be reluctant to contribute to the BCFL task without receiving enough compensation for their efforts. It is difficult to design such a mechanism because the MO has limited rewards budget, and it is necessary to make sure that the time consumption of training and mining can be shortened and a well performed global ML model can be obtained at the same time. Thus, in the following part, we build the utility models of both the MO and client from the perspectives of resource allocation and incentive mechanism.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before we formulate the game model, we should clarify the fair reward allocation scheme first.
In our system, we consider that each client has an equal chance to participate in both the training and mining processes with fair rewards.
And since the allocation of rewards to each client in training and mining has a significant impact on the system fairness and further the participation willingness, we need to design a fair reward allocation scheme.
Although we have already defined the payoff of each client during the training and mining processes in the above section, it is necessary to investigate their upper bounds based on the MO’s rewards budget. And the rewards distribution should not only be associated with the computing power of the device, but also take into account the performance of its work. On the one hand, the reward budget of the MO and the rewards that each client can get are limited; on the other hand, if the resources are allocated only based on the computing power devoted, it could lead to the situation where devices with sufficient computing power take most of the rewards, while devices with less power cannot get enough rewards, making the system unstable and unsustainable.

In our experiments, for clients and the MO, there are four strategy combinations, i.e., both sides choose the optimal strategies, one chooses the random strategies while the other chooses optimal strategies, and both choose the random strategies. For example, we define the strategy combination <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_slanted">Random vs. Optimal</span> as the clients choose the random strategies and the MO chooses the optimal strategy.
We compare the utilities of clients and the MO with random strategies and optimal strategies, respectively.

If the unit price of training increases, clients can be stimulated to provide more computing power, which reduces the time cost and improves the model performance, so the MO utility will be improved. However, the revenue of clients does not grow significantly with the increase of the unit price of training, because the cost of energy consumption also rises.

An upper-bound of the global loss function was proposed to evaluate the performance of training; in the meantime, the relationship among update rounds, block generation rate, and learning rate was explored. Although the proposed method can easily control the training and mining time by adjusting the number of updates to allocate resources, it is based on the assumption that all clients have the same amount of computing resources and local data, which is not practical.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">According to the above discussion, it can be seen that the studies related to resource allocation in BCFL are are insufficient. One of the reasons is that the research regarding BCFL is still in the early stage. Another reason is that there are many types of BCFL structures depending on the role of the blockchain playing in FL, making it difficult to have a common framework for resource allocation.
In order to assist the MO and the clients of the BCFL system to make the proper decisions, we design the mechanisms based on the two-stage Stackelberg game in this paper.
Besides, we consider allocating resources in the fully coupled BCFL with FL clients working as blockchain nodes.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies the resource allocation of clients in BCFL by designing incentive mechanism. We describe the interactions between clients and the MO as a two-stage Stakelberg game. Within our model, clients with varying computing power can determine the resources to invest in training and mining based on the rewards provided by the MO through maximizing their utilities, while the MO can also obtain the optimal utility. Since the local training related information of clients may be not known to the MO, we further study the game model and optimal solutions in the incomplete information case. Numerous experimental results show that our proposed mechanisms are effective.</p>
