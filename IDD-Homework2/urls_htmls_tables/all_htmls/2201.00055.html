<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">RF sensors have been recently proposed as a new modality for sign language processing technology. They are non-contact, effective in the dark, and acquire a direct measurement of signing kinematic via exploitation of the micro-Doppler effect. First, this work provides an in depth, comparative examination of the kinematic properties of signing as measured by RF sensors for both fluent ASL users and hearing imitation signers. Second, as ASL recognition techniques utilizing deep learning requires a large amount of training data, this work examines the effect of signing kinematics and subject fluency on adversarial learning techniques for data synthesis. Two different approaches for the synthetic training data generation are proposed: 1) adversarial domain adaptation to minimize the differences between imitation signing and fluent signing data, and 2) kinematically-constrained generative adversarial networks for accurate synthesis of RF signing signatures. The results show that the kinematic discrepancies between imitation signing and fluent signing are so significant that training on data directly synthesized from fluent RF signers offers greater performance (93% top-5 accuracy) than that produced by adaptation of imitation signing (88% top-5 accuracy) when classifying 100 ASL signs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the World Federation for the Deaf (WFD), an estimated 74 million people world-wide communicate using sign language. American Sign Language (ASL) is estimated to be the primary mode of communication for over a million people in North America and Canada, based on statistics provided by Gallaudet University (the world’s only university designed to be barrier-free for deaf and hard of hearing students located in Washington, D.C.). Although much research in ASL recognition has focused on translation (e.g. sign to speech) as a means to bridge the communication gap between Deaf and hearing individuals, this work aims at the development of RF sensing-enabled sign language processing (SLP) technologies in an ambient, non-invasive fashion for human-computer interaction (HCI) applications, such as assistive robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and smart environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. RF sensors have been successfully used for remote health monitoring of vital signs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, fall detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, gait analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and detection of sleep apnea <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> or sudden infant death syndrome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The addition of ASL recognition capability to such systems would extend their use potential to Deaf populations, and enhance the quality of life for those who use ASL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">RF sensors offer unique advantages in that they are non-contact, not restrictive or invasive, operate at a distance, protect the privacy of the user and personal spaces, and are effective in the dark, regardless of what the individual is wearing. Thus, RF sensors can recognize signing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> in situations where other sensors, such as wearables <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, are either undesireable or ineffective. RF sensors cannot perceive hand shapes or facial expressions, but they can provide a direct measure of distance and velocity as a function of time. Velocity can be obtained via the Doppler effect; namely, the principle that the frequency shift incurred in the received RF signal is proportional to the radial velocity of an object in motion. While translational motion results in a central Doppler frequency, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">micro-Doppler</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> refers to the frequency modulations generated about the center frequency that result from vibrations or rotations. As such, the micro-Doppler signature is comprised of unique patterns directly related to the kinematics of the underlying motion, and can serve as a biometric to identify individuals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, various activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and gestures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has enabled great advances in the recognition capabilities for many sensing modalities, including RF sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) require large amounts of data to learn complex underlying data representations. In biomedical applications for human motion recognition, acquisition of adequate sample sizes can be challenging; targeted populations may be mobility-impaired or reluctant to participate. Given that the Deaf are a minority community, its members are highly sought after for involvement in a variety of research studies, and thus may be wary of frequent requests. Inclusion of Deaf researchers is critical for hearing researchers to understand Deaf cultural perspectives and incorporate Deaf experiences and knowledge of the language into all aspects of SLP technology design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Our research team includes a Child-of-Deaf-Adults (CODA), who is fluent in ASL, and benefits from the involvement of community partnerships with Gallaudet University and the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind (AIDB), who have provided feedback on Deaf-centric design and aided in the recruitment of Deaf participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, reliance on extensive amounts of human subject data for training deep models can result in an undue burden on Deaf participants, even if well-intentioned and for the benefit of the community. One way some researchers have addressed the need for signing data has been to utilize ASL learners or imitation signers, e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, who are more easily recruitable. Imitation signing refers to the process of asking hearing sign-naive participants to replicate the signs shown in any video. However, it can take learners of sign language at least 3 years to produce signs in a manner that is perceived as fluent by fluent signers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Thus, even with ”training” sessions to teach participants how to articulate the signs prior to conducting the experiment with imitation signing videos, the production of hearing imitation signers is not comparable to that of fluent signing and may indeed contain significant errors in temporal dynamics and repetitions (which RF sensors easily perceive), as well as hand shape and place of articulation, i.e. position of the sign in space. In our prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we found that imitation signing and fluent signing occupy different regions in the feature space, enabling machine learning to
effectively distinguish between imitation signing and fluent signing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">But does this mean that imitation signing data has no value in the training of DNNs for fluent ASL recognition? Adversarial domain adaptation is an approach that has been utilized in the computer vision community for style transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and image-to-image translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. One approach to the design of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for domain adaptation is to use Pix2Pix GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> for image-to-image translation based on the conditional GAN, where a target image is generated, conditional on a given input image. In this case, the Pix2Pix GAN changes the loss function so that the generated image is both plausible in the content of the target domain, and is a plausible translation of the input image.

Thus, one approach to training deep models for ASL recognition could be to utilize adversarial domain adaptation to transform the imitation signing signatures to have greater resemblance to fluent signing signatures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A significant challenge to the application of adversarial learning to RF datasets, however, is that the data supplied to the DNNs are not optical images, but computed images, derived from time-frequency transform of the raw complex received RF signal. Thus, the pixels in an RF micro-Doppler signature bear no relation to geometry, lighting, or perspective. In contrast, it is the kinematics of the human skeleton that determines the frequency profiles revealed in the RF signature. In prior work, we have shown that consideration of kinematics can lead to great gains in DNN training for human activity recognition:</p>

In Section II, the experimental procedure for acquiring the 100-sign ASL datasets for imitation signers and fluent ASL users is presented. The kinematic and linguistic properties of these signs, as listed in the ASL-LEX2 database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, are described. In Section III, techniques for estimating these properties from the RF micro-Doppler signature for each sign are presented. In Section IV, the adversarial networks for domain adaptation and design of a 3-branch MBGAN for ASL training data synthesis are detailed. In particular, using the estimators developed in Section III, the degree to which different adversarial networks preserve the salient properties of each sign are quantitatively evaluated and the advantages of embedding kinematics into the GAN architecture are demonstrated. The similarity of transformed imitation signing and synthesized ASL is compared with that of fluent ASL signatures for different database sizes. In Section IV, kinematically deviant signatures are sifted out from the generated data, and the resulting synthetic datasets are used to train DNNs. In this way, the efficacy of the proposed approaches to classyfing a large number of ASL signs while minimizing real human subject data requirements is demonstrated. The paper concludes in Section V with a discussion of results and future research directions.</p>

but not phonologically related to ensure a diverse dataset in terms of both handshapes and sign kinematics. The participants repeated each sign 5 times.
The same experiment was repeated with 12 hearing participants, who did not know sign language. These participants were shown the signs prior to the experiment to familiarize them with the task. During the experiment, immediately prior to recording, the participants were prompted with a video of each sign in isolation, and asked to repeat it. Participants were presented with a random ordering of single signs minimize coarticulation during sign production. A total of 2000 fluent sign samples and 6000 imitation signing samples were collected.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most relevant kinematic information of a sign can be extracted from the motion associated with the arms and hands. Thus, the prosody of ASL is encoded in the velocity trace of the sign, since this is the simplest interpretation of the motion of the hands and arms of the signer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. In RF sensing, the micro-Doppler signature captures this velocity trace since the Doppler frequency is proportional to velocity. In this section, we describe the processing steps taken to extract three kinematic properties of ASL: hand speed, type of signs (one-handed vs. two-handed), and the number of directionally isolatable components of the sign with the motion toward the radar, termed strokes (including transitions toward and from initial and final handshapes).</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The speed of signing is measured by tracing the Doppler velocity of the upper and lower envelopes of the micro-Doppler signature. The upper envelope represents the radial velocity of the fastest point moving towards the radar, while the lower envelope gives the speed of the fastest point on the body moving away from the radar. Thus, envelopes provide a means for learning the speed of the hands during signing. Envelopes are extracted by using an energy-based thresholding method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. First, the energy corresponding to each slow time index is computed, for which the first frequency bin whose corresponding
spectrogram amplitude is greater than or equal to a threshold is tagged as an envelope pixel. The threshold is computed as the product of a pre-determined scaling factor and the energy at that slow-time index.

The RF measurements show that the hand speed of imitation signers, on average (0.45 m/s), is greater than that of fluent signers (0.36 m/s), while the standard deviation is much greater. This is reflective of the inconsistency between hearing participants in sign articulations. The greater speed in hand movements of imitation signers may on the one hand seem surprising, as one might think someone less fluent would be more hesitant. But, perhaps in part because hearing imitation signers perceive signing more akin to gesturing, than talking, their articulations are more rushed and sweeping. In contrast, fluent signers articulate the sign within a tighter space, i.e. traverse less distance, but with calculated, precise expression. This results in, on average, slower hand speeds.</p>

The number of strokes for a sign can be measured by applying peak detection algorithm to the upper envelope.

The total energy of a spectrogram is computed by summing the energy corresponding to each slow-time index.
This process is repeated for each spectrogram and then divided by the number of samples to find the algebraic mean. In this way, the total average energy for all 100 words is calculated.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compilation of large datasets for training state-of-the-art DNNs is difficult when human subjects are involved, due to the time spent in measuring numerous iterations of each class. In previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, ASL recognition using conventional supervised machine learning was explored due to the small amount of available real data: 9 samples per class per sensor, using a total of 5 sensors. The minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) method was used to select 150 handcrafted features for input to a random forest classifier, resulting in a classification accuracy of 72.5% for 20 ASL signs.
Later, a slightly larger dataset was acquired (on average of 40 samples per class per sensor for 3 sensors at different frequencies) to train a DNN for fusion of multi-frequency sensor data to achieve an accuracy of 95% for the same 20 ASL signs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. The limitations in the amount of available real training data also limited the depth and accuracy of the DNNs utilized.</p>

However, this can lead to over-optimistic results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> due to the differences in production between imitation and fluent signers, which are also captured by the RF sensor measurements as presented in Section III. This is further evidenced by the ability to distinguish between the RF data from fluent versus imitation signers using a support vector machine classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

CycleGAN translates an image from a source domain A to a target domain B by forming a series connection between two GANs to form a “cycle”: the first GAN tries to synthesize “fake fluent” ASL data from the imitation signing data, while the second GAN works to reconstruct the original sample, synthesizing “fake imitation” ASL samples. Thus, the network tries to minimize the cycle consistency loss, i.e. the difference between the input of the first GAN and the output of second GAN.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Each CycleGAN generator is comprised of three sections: an encoder, a transformer, and a decoder. The input image is fed directly into the encoder, which shrinks the representation size while increasing the number of channels. The encoder is composed of three convolution layers. The resulting activation is passed to the transformer, a series of six residual blocks. It is then expanded again by the decoder, which uses two transpose convolutions to enlarge the representation size, and one output layer to produce the final transformed image.
The discriminators are comprised of PatchGANs - fully convolutional neural networks that look at a “patch” of the input image, and output the probability of the patch being “real.” This is both more computationally efficient than trying to look at the entire input image, and is also more effective since it allows the discriminator to focus on more localized features, like texture.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Pix2Pix signatures show better adherence to the kinematic properties of fluent signing than CycleGAN.
Notice that on average, the CycleGAN signatures exhibit more error in hand speed, number of strokes and detection of handedness relative to those generated by Pix2Pix. Increasing the number of generated CycleGAN samples has only a slight detrimental effect on hand speed, while more significant errors are induced in the number of strokes and handedness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that there are two different causes for kinematic errors: first, the lack of fluency in the language, and second, the network itself. Let us first consider the reasons for why Pix2Pix significantly outperforms CycleGAN. In prior work, we showed that the generative process creates synthetic data with significant kinematic errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which are described more in the next section. Networks generate kinematic errors because RF data is not naturally an image, but converted into a 2D format via time-frequency analysis (Section II-C). Hence, spatial correlations are not based on physical proximity (as in optical images), but on the distribution of velocity across the human body and the constraints imposed by the skeleton. However, the GAN architectures are not supplied with any information or metric pertaining to these constraints, resulting in synthetic samples that bear spatial resemblance, but in fact correspond to physically impossible movement. The CycleGAN architecture includes two generators, in contrast to the single generator of Pix2Pix; hence, the greater the amount of kinematic errors exhibited in the CycleGAN synthesized samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, imitation signing data itself has significantly more error in average speed as well as the number of strokes, as was shown in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ III-C One-Handed vs. Two-Handed Signs ‣ III Estimation of Signing Kinematics ‣ Effect of Kinematics and Fluency in Adversarial Synthetic Data Generation for ASL Recognition with RF Sensors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. That these errors persist in the domain adapted signatures can be seen by observing that the average errors in Pix2Pix and CycleGAN synthesized data remain significantly greater than the levels observed in fluent signing data. In fact, the error in average speed of Pix2Pix data exceeds that observed even in real imitation signing data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One way to mitigate such problems is to design the GAN so as to enable greater emphasis on preservation of the shape of the envelope. The envelopes correspond to the maximum velocity towards/away from the radar; so, from the standpoint of hand kinematics, the synthetic signatures should conform to, and not exceed the envelope profiles of source data. In prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, a multi-branch GAN (MBGAN) architecture with an additional auxiliary branch in the WGAN discriminator, which took as input the upper envelope, was proposed as a means of ensuring kinematic accuracy when synthesizing micro-Doppler signatures of different ambulatory gaits, such as walking, limping, or taking short steps. However, during production of sign language, the hands may move towards or away from the radar, so both the upper and lower envelopes are important for maintaining critical kinematic features. Hence, in this work, we incorporated two additional auxiliary branches in the discriminator: one that takes the upper envelope as input, and a second that takes the lower envelope as input. The resulting MBGAN with 3-branch discriminator is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-B Direct Synthesis of ASL Sign Signatures ‣ IV Adversarial Learning Approaches ‣ Effect of Kinematics and Fluency in Adversarial Synthetic Data Generation for ASL Recognition with RF Sensors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The generator is comprised of 10 convolutional layers; each layer is followed by batch normalization
with 0.9 momentum and a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The main branch of the discriminator is
an 8-layer CNN, where each layer is followed by a Leaky-ReLU activation function. Each auxiliary branch is comprised of three 1D-convolutional layers.
The outputs of the dense layers are concatenated with the flattened output of the main discriminator.</p>

The both networks used 75% of the fluent signing data as input during training, and the remaining are used for testing.
Notice that the synthetic training data generated by WGAN or MBGAN outperform both Pix2Pix and CycleGAN with respect to generating signatures that have greater kinematic fidelity to fluent signing data. While the kinematic errors in WGAN generated signatures increase as the network generates a greater amount of synthetic samples, the errors in MBGAN signatures are fewer, and constant over sample size - only a slight drop in the accuracy in replicating the correct number of strokes is incurred, from %99.5 to %98. Visually, MBGAN signatures may be observed to have greater resemblance to fluent ASL samples in comparison with the WGAN samples, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-C Kinematic Sifting ‣ IV Adversarial Learning Approaches ‣ Effect of Kinematics and Fluency in Adversarial Synthetic Data Generation for ASL Recognition with RF Sensors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

Ideally, we wish to generate training data that is statistically independent, diverse, and representative of the range of potential variations within possible articulations of each sign. The presence of kinematically erroneous samples can have a corrupting effect that leads to confusion between different signs. Thus, we seek to remove such samples.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In comparing Pix2Pix results with that of WGAN, readers should be reminded that domain adaptation methods predominantly utilize a PatchGAN architecture in the discriminator, which operates on localized patches in the image, while WGAN and MBGAN discriminators operate on the entire image. Both results in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and comparisons we conducted on radar micro-Doppler signatures reveal that operations on patches are more effective than that on the entire image. For example, Pix2Pix with a PatchGAN discriminator generates much crisper and textured synthetic signatures than Pix2Pix with a discriminator operating on the entire image. This is likely because discriminators operating on the entire image cannot model the sharpness of high frequency components in the image as effectively. Modeling high frequencies requires restricting attention to the structure in local image patches through the application of penalties at a patch-scale. Despite utilization of the entire image, rather than patches, in the discriminator, WGAN synthesized signatures exhibited fewer kinematic errors than the domain adaptation networks we considered.</p>

These errors are due to the generation process itself, and can be mitigated through modification of GAN architecture, such as done in the proposed MBGAN.

For example, do the variations between synthetic samples correspond to plausible variations within a certain subject profile (physical or linguistic), or span all probable articulations within a class? Improvements to the generation of synthetic data for training will require a better understanding of not just the statistical properties, but also the physical and linguistic properties of the synthetic samples to ensure good model generalization.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although imitation signing has been used in some studies of sign language recognition, imitation signers exhibit significant differences in kinematics of sign production as compared with fluent signers. This results in substantial statistical differences between imitation and fluent ASL data, which has rendered imitation data ineffective when used to train DNNs for fluent signing recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. This work investigates the use of domain adaptation to transform imitation signing samples to have greater resemblance to fluent signing data, and compares the efficacy of this approach with direct generation of synthetic data from fluent signing data. A novel approach to synthetic RF signature generation is proposed, which is shown to generate samples with greater kinematic fidelity than conventional GANs for transformation of imitation signing samples. Proposed kinematic metrics are extracted from RF ASL signatures and used to evaluate GAN-generated synthetic data from a kinematic perspective. The classification results obtained using a CAE were found to be directly proportionate to the kinematic fidelity of the synthetic data. The proposed methods were used to achieve 77% top-1 accuracy, 89% top-3 accuracy, and 93% top-5 accuracy for the recognition of 100 ASL signs.</p>
