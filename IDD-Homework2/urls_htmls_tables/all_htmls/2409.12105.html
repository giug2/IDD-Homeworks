<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data. This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. our code is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/18sym/FedLF" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://github.com/18sym/FedLF</a>.</p>

To address this problem, federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without uploading their local private data to the server. As deep learning continues to evolve, FL shows great potentials as a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient framework in various application domains  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zeng et al.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in FL, the data sets of the participating clients come from different sources, and data heterogeneity is inevitable  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>)</cite>. Existing federated learning methods mainly discuss the scenario of clients’ data heterogeneity under a balanced global class distribution, ignoring the phenomenon of an unbalanced global class distribution in actual scenarios. In these scenarios, the global data often follows a long-tailed distribution, where a large number of samples are concentrated in a few classes, while other classes are represented by only a few samples. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (left), the classes with a large number of samples are called head class and the classes with a small number of samples are called tail class. Under the dual challenges of client data heterogeneity and the long-tailed distribution of global data, it gets harder for FL to train an effective global model, which we call federated long-tailed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite>. For instance, multiple companies come together for joint training to develop an autonomous driving model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nguyen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Normal driving behaviours are well represented in the dataset, while rare critical behaviours are underrepresented. This leads to local models that can handle typical situations but fail to correctly handle rare scenarios, making them perform poorly in emergencies, such as sudden obstacles, sharp turns and so on. Furthermore, insufficient recognition and prediction of different behaviours of pedestrians and non-motor vehicles will lead to the model not being able to respond correctly to sudden situations, increasing the risk of accidents. This indicates that tail class judgement is also a significant factor, and that a method to resolve the federated long-tail problem is urgently required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the impact of long-tailed distribution, a straightforward solution is to apply existing solutions to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution to the federated long-tailed problem. However, the extensive experimental results in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Results and Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Results and Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> show that these solutions do not lead to effective improvement. We propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning method, FedLF, inspired by FedRS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li and Zhan (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and Logit adjustment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Menon et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. It counteracts the federated long-tailed problem by adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. Specifically, we make three modifications to the local training. Firstly, we adaptively adjust the logits of the local model according to the different local data distribution information of each client. The purpose is to ensure that the model does not overfit the head classes and can pay more attention to the tail classes, ensuring that the model treats each class fairly. Secondly, we maintain a set of continuously optimizable class centers locally, which greatly improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability by adjusting the distance between features and their corresponding class centers. Finally, we continuously reduce the similarity among features by introducing the relationship matrix of features. Unlike complex algorithms that need to deal with large amounts of data or expose private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Luo et al.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most common challenges in federated learning is data heterogeneity. During the training process of federated learning, data heterogeneity hinders the convergence speed of the model and leads to degradation of model performance. Currently, many schemes are proposed to solve the data heterogeneity problem, which are mainly classified into two strategies: client side and server side. On the client side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, strategies with local regulation limit the training process. For instance, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduces regularization terms to prevent local updates from significantly deviating from the global model, thus minimizing the impact of data heterogeneity. An alternative approach is FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which incorporates server-distributed penalty terms into each client’s learning objective in each round of training, thereby guiding the local model towards global optimisation. On the server side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>, global knowledge is usually used to mitigate the negative impact of data heterogeneity among clients. An excellent example is FedTGP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>, which maintains a set of trainable global prototypes on the server to help clients train prototypes with better intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. Although these methods effectively solve the challenge of data heterogeneity among clients, they generally ignore the long-tailed distribution of global data, which often leads to poor performance of the model in judging the tail classes.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Long-tailed data distributions widely exist in the real world, which put forward new requirements for the development of deep learning, have received extensive attention in research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. The existing solutions to the long-tailed problem are mainly divided into two perspectives: data side and model side. On the data side, it mainly contains two kinds of approaches: reweighting and resampling. Reweighting methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cui et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> modify the weights of the loss values assigned to different classes of samples. For instance, Focal Loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> assigns greater weight to challenging samples based on predicted probabilities, which enables the model to prioritize the training of difficult samples. Resampling methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang and Pfister (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> mitigate the detrimental effect of the limited number of tail classes on the performance of the model through under-sampling the head classes or over-sampling the tail classes. On the model side, it mainly includes model decoupling and logit adjustment mechanism. Model decoupling  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> focuses on reducing the model’s preferences by recalibrating the classifiers, which prompts the model to look at each class more fairly. Logit adjustment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Menon et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is a more fine-grained solutionand aims to equalize the impact of each class, improving the model’s overall accuracy. Such as LADE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> matches the target label distribution by post-processing the model prediction trained by the cross-entropy loss and the Softmax function. However, all the above schemes assume a centralised training scenario. Faced with the challenges posed by distributed training, most of these methods are ineffective. Moreover, in the case of data heterogeneity, the complexity of training increases further, making it lose its effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to develop an approach that deals with the federated long-tailed problem.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the federated long-tailed learning problem, recent research uses mechanisms such as distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shang et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>)</cite>, A new distillation method with logit adjustment and a calibration gating network is proposed to alleviate the problems associated with long-tailed data. CReFF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> develops a set of constantly updated federated features to retrain classifiers on the server-side, achieving comparable performance to training models on real data. While the above methods relieve the problems posed by long tailed data to some extent, they usually require complex operations using auxiliary data or may pose significant risks to data privacy. Therefore, we propose FedLF, which requires only a modification of the local training part to obtain superior performance. In addition, it also provides maximum performance of tail classes, with details in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Results and Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Results and Analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the imbalance in the distribution of classes, we locally adjust the classifier’s influence weights on each class on the client side. This adjustment makes the training process more fair and improves sensitivity to all classes. Specifically, the score matrix for each class is multiplied by the adjusted local label distribution matrix. The details are as follows:</p>

This smoothing step introduces a certain degree of uniformity while preserving the original distributional characteristics of the data. It ensures that the model does not become overly sensitive to classes with extreme distribution during training. By retaining the essential information of each class and reducing the influence of outliers, this approach enhances the model’s ability to learn from less frequent classes. Ultimately, this helps improve the model’s generalization ability and fairness across uneven datasets.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we have four different metrics when evaluating model performance: header classes accuracy, middle classes accuracy, tail classes accuracy, and all classes accuracy. To define the head and tail classes, we introduce thresholds. We set the classes with more samples above the thresholds as head classes, and the classes with fewer samples than the thresholds as tail classes. We have different thresholds for different degrees of long-tailed. Specifically, for CIFAR-10-LT, the thresholds are set to (1500, 200) when the long-tail factor IF is 100 and 50, and (1500, 600) when the IF is 10. For CIFAR-100-LT, the threshold is set to (200,20) when the long-tail factor IF is 100 and 50, and (300, 60) when the IF is 10.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedProx, FedBN and FedRS mainly address data heterogeneity. The results of FedProx and FedBN perform similarly to FedAvg because they primarily focus on addressing data heterogeneity without considering long tailed distribution.

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The performance gap between the above methods and ours is due to the fact that FedProx, FedBN and FedRS mainly solve the problem of data heterogeneity among clients and do not take into account the long-tailed factor, which is the most common factor in real life.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present FedLF to enhance federated learning under data heterogeneity and global long-tailed data. FedLF is a client-side approach, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logits adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of each component of FedLF is verified. Experiments show that FedLF achieves superior results on datasets with heterogeneous and long-tailed settings compares to seven other state-of-the-art methods. For future works, we aim to study federated learning robustness against noisy labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu et al.
