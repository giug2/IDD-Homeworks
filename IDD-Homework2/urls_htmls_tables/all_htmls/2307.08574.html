<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity across clients is one of the key challenges in Federated Learning (FL), which may slow down the global model convergence and even weaken global model performance.
Most existing approaches tackle the heterogeneity by constraining local model updates through reference to global information provided by the server.
This can alleviate the performance degradation on the aggregated global model. Different from existing methods, we focus the information exchange between clients, which could also enhance the effectiveness of local training and lead to generate a high-performance global model.
Concretely, we propose a novel FL framework named FedCME by client matching and classifier exchanging.
In FedCME, clients with large differences in data distribution will be matched in pairs, and then the corresponding pair of clients will exchange their classifiers at the stage of local training in an intermediate moment. Since the local data determines the local model training direction, our method can correct update direction of classifiers and effectively alleviate local update divergence.
Besides, we propose feature alignment to enhance the training of the feature extractor.
Experimental results demonstrate that FedCME performs better than FedAvg, FedProx, MOON and FedRS on popular federated learning benchmarks including FMNIST and CIFAR10, in the case where data are heterogeneous.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning(FL)
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
has emerged as a new paradigm of distributed machine learning, which enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a powerful global model without transmitting local private data to the server.
It is now successfully used in some real-world scenarios, e.g., health care
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,
smart city
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and recommended system
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning has made great achievements in some scenarios, it still faces many challenges
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, such as heterogeneity, communication cost and privacy protection. Among them, heterogeneity is divided into system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. The former is when each client has a different amount of bandwidth and computational power, which can been partly resolved by native asynchronous scheme of federated learning
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
In our work, we mainly focus on data heterogeneity, namely Non-IID problem, where clients have varying amounts of data coming from distinct distributions
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Because of data heterogeneity, the local training trajectory may diverge a lot from the global target due to the differences between the local and global data distribution
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
The more heterogeneous the local data set is, the slower the training convergence speed will be. What is more, it will be harder to attain a global model with good performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This is because the local model is trained on its local data, which is achieved by minimizing the local empirical loss. However, minimizing the local empirical loss is fundamentally inconsistent with minimizing the global empirical loss in heterogeneous federated learning
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the data heterogeneity problem, quite a number of methods have been proposed. For instance,
FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>
puts forward to utilize a proximal term in the local training process to constrain the direction of local model updates, thereby reducing the gap between local and global optimization. MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> uses model comparison to maximize the consistency between the representation learned by the current local model and the representation learned by the global model to correct local updates.
FedRS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposes
’Restricted Softmax’ to limit the update of missing classes’ weights
during the local procedure. But in cases where there are no missing categories in the local data but large differences in the numbers between categories, the effect of FedRS will approximate that of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Instead, we focus the information exchange between clients, which could
also enhance the effectiveness of local training and lead to get
a well-performed global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, according to existing researches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the classifier has a greater impact on model performance than the feature extractor. In the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, they find that the difference between the same model after training with different sets of heterogeneous data mainly lies in the classifier. This is also a significant reason why the training direction of the client model deviates from the training direction of the global model in the scenario of heterogeneous data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the observation above, we propose to handle data heterogeneity by classifier exchanging: the local model divergence is mitigated when the classifier is trained on two datasets with complementary distributions (as Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedCME: Client Matching and Classifier Exchanging to Handle Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows) . However, how to find suitable client pairs is a key issue. In our method FedCME, the server will perform pairwise matching based on the latest evaluation vectors of clients (obtained by the client’s self-evaluation, which roughly reflects the data distribution) at the beginning of each global iteration round. Afterwards halfway through the local training, the pairwise clients exchange classifiers with each other. The rest of the local training is conducted using the classifier from its counterpart.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, we propose feature alignment to assist local training. During local training, the features output by the feature extractor of the local model are aligned with their corresponding global features for each category to enhance the training of the feature extractor.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can have high training efficiency and reach better performance compared with some existing algorithms, FedAvg, FedProx, MOON, FedRS, using datasets including FMNIST, CIFAR10. Besides, we also conducted multiple ablation experiments to prove the rationality and effectiveness of our method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The rest of this paper is divided into five sections.
We present related works on addressing data heterogeneity in Section II. In Section III, FedAvg and data heterogeneity will be covered in detail. The methodology and experiments are presented in Section IV and V respectively. Section VI is the conclusion and outlines future work.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> demonstrates that data heterogeneity can slow down FL convergence speed. Furthermore, the performance of the final converged global model will be reduced as a result <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, many methods have been proposed to solve this problem. They can be roughly divided into four categories:</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data Sharing.</span> These methods introduce public datasets or
synthesized data to help construct a more balanced data distribution on the client or on the server. The conventional approach involves creating an adequate number of publicly shared datasets among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aggregation Scheme.</span> These methods mainly improve the way in which the model is aggregated on the server side. For example, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>
considers that clients with different computing power may need to perform varying numbers of local steps in local training.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Personalized Federated Learning.</span> Those methods aim to train personalized models for individual clients rather than a shared global model

client as a task in meta-learning
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client Drift Mitigation.</span> Due to heterogeneous data, the optimization direction of the global model is inconsistent with that of the local model, resulting in what is called ’client drift’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In order to mitigate it, a lot of targeted works has been produced. The first work among them is FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which proposes a a proximal term to constrain the local model to deviate too much from the global model during training. Apart from this, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> aims to maximize the consistency between the representation learned by the local model and that learned by the global model through a contrastive loss. In addition, FedRS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> takes into account more details regarding the local models. Specifically, it reveals that the top layers of neural networks are more task-specific, and good performance can also be achieved by only adjusting the classifier of the local model based on local data distribution.</p>

<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our work focuses on mitigating client drift. In our method, the model is divided into a feature extractor and a classifier during local training. For the feature extractor, we align local features with global features to improve its performance. For the classifier, we use evaluation vectors obtained through local model self-evaluation for doing clients matching and then exchange the classifier with their respective counterparts.</p>

And then it proceeds to complete the remaining half of the local training. After all selected clients finish local training, the FL server will receive the parameters of their local models for aggregation to obtain the global model of the next global round. It also receives local sample features which will be combined with global features from the current global round to generate new global features for the next round. Additionally, it also receives the evaluation vector obtained by self-evaluation using partial local data, which can be used to match with a counterpart when selected again. The server and clients repeat the above processes until the global model converges. More details will be introduced below.</p>

After exchanging classifiers, they will continue with their respective local training until completing it.
Since the local model training direction is determined by the local data, and the exchanged classifier is trained by two approximately complementary data sets,
the above operations can efficiently correct the direction of classifier training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assist with training, we propose a feature alignment method to enhance the feature extractor for local model training on the client side. To be specific, we align the local features obtained from the feature extractor of local model during local training with the global features of the corresponding category sent by the server. As a result, an additional loss function will be generated to perform backpropagation for the feature extractor of local model. In the following we will describe in detail the local features and the global features, as well as the process of feature alignment.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">How About Many-to-One Matching.</span> In our method, we take pairwise matching. Why not many-to-one matching? To investigate this question, we conduct two comparison experiments using many-to-one matching between clients, in which clients can be matched repeatedly. During the matching process, multiple classifiers from different client models may be replaced by the same classifier that is deemed most suitable. The result is shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Ablation Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedCME: Client Matching and Classifier Exchanging to Handle Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>: many-to-one matching results are worse than pairwise matching results. In these experiments, we find that some clients are not matched during many-to-one matching, and the classifiers of these clients are not used. This causes the framework to lose some useful information.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">How About Exchanging The Whole Model Or The Feature Extractor.</span> As we can see in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Ablation Study ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedCME: Client Matching and Classifier Exchanging to Handle Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, when we choose to exchange the whole model parameters during exchanging, not only is it not better, but it also slows down the training of the model than exchanging the classifier. Therefore, this means that exchanging the whole model parameters is not as good as exchanging the classifier performance. Likewise, when only exchanging the feature extractor, the training is not as efficient as when exchanging the classifier. More notably, most models nowadays consist of one or two linear layers in the classifier, while the number of layers in the feature extractor is getting deeper and deeper in order to improve the model’s effectiveness. This also indicates that there will be unnecessary communication overhead if the feature extractor needs to be exchanged.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we propose FedCME, a FL framework that enables FL to attain a more efficient global model in the case of heterogeneous data among clients.
In FedCME, we propose a matching mechanism for exchanging classifiers to effectively mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity in the training process and propose feature alignment to assist the training process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedCME provides better performance for mitigating client drift caused by data heterogeneity. Furthermore, in different degrees of data heterogeneity and different client selection strategies, FedCME also has a good performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our current work, the model is statically divided into a feature extractor and a classifier, and the exchange time is also determined statically. However, there may be more efficient dynamic methods for different scenarios and models. In future work, we will explore this direction.</p>
