<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning effectively addresses issues such as data privacy by collaborating across participating devices to train global models. However, factors such as network topology and device computing power can affect its training or communication process in complex network environments.
A new network architecture and paradigm with computing-measurable, perceptible, distributable, dispatchable, and manageable capabilities, computing and network convergence (CNC) of 6G networks can effectively support federated learning training and improve its communication efficiency. By guiding the participating devices’ training in federated learning based on business requirements, resource load, network conditions, and arithmetic power of devices, CNC can reach this goal.
In this paper, to improve the communication efficiency of federated learning in complex networks, we study the communication efficiency optimization of federated learning for computing and network convergence of 6G networks, methods that gives decisions on its training process for different network conditions and arithmetic power of participating devices in federated learning. The experiments address two architectures that exist for devices in federated learning and arrange devices to participate in training based on arithmetic power while achieving optimization of communication efficiency in the process of transferring model parameters.
The results show that the method we proposed can (1) cope well with complex network situations (2) effectively balance the delay distribution of participating devices for local training (3) improve the communication efficiency during the transfer of model parameters (4) improve the resource utilization in the network.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, machine learning models are trained collaboratively on multiple devices without the need for third parties to share training data. Therefore, federated learning with distributed architecture can effectively solve the problem of data silos. Moreover, compared with traditional machine learning it reduces data transfer costs while ensuring fairness among participants. But there are still many challenges to federated learning. The main challenges are manifested in several major aspects such as data privacy, communication consumption, device
training latency, and statistical heterogeneity during the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Among these, communication issue is a huge challenge.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">But today, computing and network convergence (CNC) of 6G networks has been proposed as a new network architecture and paradigm. Its various characteristics can fit well with federated learning. In detail, the CNC can rely on powerful heterogeneous resource scheduling capability and ubiquitous network connection to achieve real-time, flexible, and efficient resource allocation, while ensuring synchronous information sharing of the whole network.
Its efficient information-sharing mechanism, high utilization of computing power resources of nodes in the network, and the ability to select and schedule network data traffic paths can effectively improve the data and information communication efficiency of participating clients in the federated learning and optimize the whole training process. This shows that the combination of federated learning and CNC is necessary and effective.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Solutions to the communication problem in federated learning focus on several aspects, such as reducing the amount of data for transmitting model parameters, reducing the frequency of communication, changing the type of communication, changing the aggregation method, using routing strategies, employing knowledge distillation, etc. As the model parameters or gradients passed in federated learning exist in the form of matrices, some scholars have used compression, quantization, and sparsification to reduce the amount of data while ensuring the validity of the data. Based on this idea they adopted two methods of random number seeding and sketch updating to reduce the amount of data for the model parameters<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

In each global training, clients in traditional architecture receive the global model from the server and train it with their local data. Then they will transmit the updated model to the server.

Thus federated learning moves on to the next round of global training, which does not end until the global model reaches a certain accuracy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We stratify the CNC into an infrastructure layer, resource pooling layer, resource information announcement layer, computing scheduling optimization layer, service layer, and orchestration and management layer. As devices of the infrastructure layer, the aggregation servers and client devices involved in federated learning are scheduled and controlled by the CNC. Equipment in the resource pooling layer model the network resources, computing power resources, etc. of the underlying devices.
The information announcement layer, on the other hand, consists of specialized equipment. Downwards it collects various information from the participating devices or publishes training strategies. Upwards it forwards information about the clients to the scheduling optimization layer or obtains decision information from the upper layer.
The scheduling and optimization layer is responsible for optimizing the federated learning scheduling algorithms and topological decisions based on the information from the underlying layer. Then it outputs the control information for the federated learning training in real time.
orchestration and management layer has control of the entire system of the CNC. It’s responsible for orchestrating and scheduling the various resources used in federal learning, as well as managing the various devices in the other layers. The security and services orchestration layer is also under its control.</p>

The traditional architecture requires the aggregation of server clusters and client devices to participate in the training, and the logical transmission topology is shown by the gray dashed line. In peer-to-peer architecture, only client devices are required to participate in training.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we design a traditional architecture in which clients of the federated learning are in a wireless network environment. Each client occupies one Resource Block(RB) of the orthogonal frequency division multiple access technique. We follow the mathematical formulation of reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to model the problem of client model parameter transmission. Based on this, the uplink rate at which the user transmits data to the central server can be expressed as:</p>

Similar to the above description, accelerating the rate at which accuracy increases with the number of global training is achieved at the expense of some communication performance. Increasing the sampling ratio will exacerbate the local training energy consumption and the energy consumption for transmitting model parameters. Moreover, increasing the number of local training times per global training will result in longer local training delays.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, Our proposed optimization method greatly reduces the local training latency during training without excessive transmission energy or latency consumption.

The optimization under peer-to-peer structures can be advantageous when there are fewer nodes involved in federated learning. Solving the TSP problem does not guarantee a small local training time, although it is possible to find the optimal transmission path. And in the Baseline, although it guarantees smaller transmission consumption and local training delay, the gradient information obtained by the model per global training is not rich compared to our proposed method.
In addition, optimization of CNC in peer-to-peer architecture can output models with higher accuracy than traditional architecture. The average accuracy of the former is close to 92% while the latter is as high as about 97%.</p>
