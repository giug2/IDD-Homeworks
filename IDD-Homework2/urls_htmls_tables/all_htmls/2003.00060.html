<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Firing a gun leaves marks on cartridge cases which purportedly uniquely identify the gun. Firearms examiners typically use a visual examination to evaluate if two cartridge cases were fired from the same gun, and this is a subjective process that has come under scrutiny. Matching can be done in a more reproducible manner using automated algorithms. In this paper, we develop methodology to compare topographical measurements of cartridge cases. We demonstrate the use of a record linkage framework in this context. We compare performance using topographical measurements to older reflectance microscopy images, investigating the extent to which the former produce more accurate comparisons. Using a diverse collection of images of over 1,100 cartridge cases, we find that overall performance is generally improved using topographical data. Some subsets of the data achieve almost perfect predictive performance in terms of precision and recall, while some produce extremely poor performance. Further work needs to be done to assess if examiners face similar difficulties on certain gun and ammunition combinations. For automatic methods, a fuller investigation into their fairness and robustness is necessary before they can be deployed in practice.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When a crime is committed, the perpetrator almost invariably leaves behind traces of evidence, which could take various forms, for example DNA, fingerprints, bullets, cartridge cases, shoeprints or digital evidence. Forensic matching involves comparing pairs of samples, to infer if they originated from the same source. The underlying assumption is that pieces of evidence have identifiable characteristics that can be traced back to their source.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of firearms, firing a gun leaves marks on the bottom surface of the cartridge case. The mechanism by which this happens is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

During the firing process the cartridge is hit by the firing pin, which causes it to break up into two components: the bullet which goes out the barrel, and the cartridge case that is ejected from the side. This process leaves at least two kinds of marks, seen in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a><a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>. The firing pin hits the cartridge, leaving a firing pin impression, and the breech block presses against the primer of the cartridge, leaving breechface marks. The breech block is harder than the primer, and may have microscopic defects or patterns that are impressed on the primer. This paper focuses exclusively on breechface marks.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Law enforcement officers routinely collect guns and cartridge cases from crime scenes, because of their potential usefulness in investigations. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in the United States maintains a national database called the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). This contains around 3.3 million images of cartridge cases retrieved from crime scenes, and an additional 12.7 million test fires (as of May 2018) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. In current practice, cartridge cases may be entered into NIBIN through a computer-based platform called the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS), which was developed and is maintained by Ultra Electronics Forensic Technology Inc. This platform captures an image of the retrieved cartridge case and runs a proprietary search against some user-selected subset of the database (for example images from a certain geographical location). This returns a list of top ranked potential matches. Firearms examiners may then select a subset that they find to be promising. They may then locate the physical cartridge cases associated with these images, to be examined under a comparison microscope. The final determination of a match or non-match is made by the examiner, based on whether there is “sufficient agreement” between the marks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(AFTE Criteria for Identification
Committee, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>)</cite>. The examiner may then bring this evidence to court. It is the examiner that attributes any evidence to a particular source; the NIBIN system is simply used as an investigative tool to generate leads. It is up to the discretion of firearms examiners whether or not to enter retrieved cartridge cases into NIBIN. In addition, the NIBIN database is proprietary and unavailable for study.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The current system has been fraught with controversy. Historically, forensic methods in general have been vetted by the legal system, as opposed to the scientific community. Beginning in the 1990s, exonerations due to DNA evidence revealed problems in many forensic science disciplines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bell et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Examiners have been found to have overstated forensic results, leading (at least in part) to wrongful convictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Murphy, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. A 2009 National Academy of Sciences report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(National Research Council, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> called for an overhaul of the forensic science system. With respect to forensic matching, it stated that with the exception of nuclear DNA analysis, disciplines had neither scientific support nor a proper quantification of error rates or limitations. In 2016, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) followed up with an independent report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(President’s Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, specifically addressing any scientific developments in the various pattern matching disciplines. For firearms analysis, there were concerns that there had been insufficient studies establishing the reliability of conclusions made by examiners, and the associated error rates had not been adequately determined. The report suggested two directions for the future. The first is to “continue to improve firearms analysis as a subjective method,” by conducting further studies, and the second is to “convert firearms analysis from a subjective method to an objective method.”</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Commercial and academic groups have made some progress with respect to the second recommendation. For breechface marks, examples of related work include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Song et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Roth et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>. The general methodology is as follows. First select the relevant breechface marks, using some form of manual input. Then use various image processing steps to extract relevant features, or derive a similarity score directly. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Song et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> split the breechface area into a grid of cells and aligns them independently, producing a similarity score that is defined as the number of matching cells. A pre-specified cutoff is used for classifying a pair as matched, in other words coming from the same source. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Roth et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> use a supervised classification method (gradient boosting) to classify pairs of images as being matched or not. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Giudice et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> employ a slightly different strategy, developing a fully automatic method that does not require any pre-processing.</p>

They extract geometric feature points that “a trained firearms examiner would identify,” such as ridges, peaks, gouges, and concavities. These features are then aligned, as a set, to the features from another image. Logistic regression is used to produce a similarity score, with covariates such as number of matched features as input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lilien, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The shortcomings of currently available methods are that none of them are both fully automatic and open source. Automatic methods ensure that results are objective and reproducible, and open source software allows proper testing and validation. In this paper, we contribute methodology for comparing topographical measurements of cartridge cases, that is both open source and fully automatic, allowing for a transparent evaluation. This builds on work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tai and Eddy (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, which focuses on reflectance images as opposed to topographical measurements (more details in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Data ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tai (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, which proposes a framework for developing forensic matching methods. Software is available at <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">https://github.com/xhtai/cartridges3D</span>. We apply a record linkage framework to forensic matching, demonstrating the principled use of statistical methods in the forensic sciences, at the same time contributing an application of record linkage methods that is non-traditional. We conduct a comprehensive analysis involving over 1,100 images, enabling us to compare performance across different firearms and ammunition. Further, we do a detailed comparison of results produced using older reflectance microscopy technology versus topographical measurements. All these (and more; see Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Discussion and conclusion ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) are essential steps before such automated methods can be deployed in actual criminal cases, or determined to be an improvement over the current system. At the same time, more work needs to be done to compare the results of automatic methods to examiner conclusions. If the two are related, results based on automatic methods might shed some light on examiner error rates over a large number of examples, and provide insight into comparisons that examiners may struggle with.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current technology allows for digital representations of fired cartridge cases to be captured and stored for later comparison. Reflectance microscopes measure the amount of light reflected off the object’s surface, producing grayscale images. In the literature these are often called 2D images. Newer technology in the form of 3D profilers (such as confocal microscopes) measure surface contours directly, producing topographical measurements. These are often termed 3D images, although both these types of data come in the form of 2D matrices, with entries being either reflectance or depth values. For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the two types of representations as 2D and 3D images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has advocated the use of 3D images because of their insensitivity to lighting conditions and traceability to the International System of Units (SI) unit of length <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Song et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. The SI system comprises units of measurement built on base units that have precise standards of measurements. Specifically, base units are derived from invariant constants of nature (that can be observed and measured with great accuracy), and one physical artifact. This means that measurements of cartridge cases using any instrument can be compared to a known standard, and instruments can be calibrated to this known standard to assess and ensure precision.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The focus of this paper is on developing methods for 3D data. We also compare the results from comparisons made using 2D and 3D data, to investigate if purportedly more accurate measurements translate into better comparison results. In the literature, methods are typically developed for either 2D or 3D data, with limited direct comparisons made between the two.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We use data from NIST’s Ballistics Toolmark Research Database (<span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">https://tsapps.nist.gov/NRBTD</span>). This is an open-access research database of bullet and cartridge case toolmark data, which to our knowledge, is the largest publicly available collection of reference data. Although a national database of firearms data exists (NIBIN), these data are not publicly available. The NIST database contains images originating from studies conducted by various groups in the firearm and toolmark community. Almost all of the currently available data are of cartridge cases that were sent to NIST for imaging, but the website also allows users to upload their own data in a standardized format. We study a subset of 1,158 of these images. We limit our analysis to measurements made by NIST, using disc scanning confocal microscopy. The technology for measuring surface topographies is relatively new, and as far as we know, there are no standardized procedures on how these images should be captured. For this paper, we begin with NIST-collected measurements made using a single method of measurement, for the sake of uniformity and ease of comparison. Future work could involve examining the variability due to instrument, method of measurement, and so forth.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to automatically match 3D images of cartridge cases, we make use of a record linkage framework. Record linkage is the process of inferring which entries in different databases correspond to the same real-world identity, in the absence of a unique identifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Christen, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. Beginning with records from two databases A and B to be linked, fields such as name and address are pre-processed and standardized. This results in some set of features for each record. Indexing methods might then be used to reduce the comparison space, for example candidate pairs in a demographic database might be restricted to those born in the same month, with all other pairs not being considered for linkage. Now pairwise comparisons are generated, consisting of one or more similarity measures. These pairwise data are then classified into matches and non-matches (and possibly a third category, potential matches). This classification step may be designed to incorporate restrictions such as one-to-one links, or preserving transitivity. A clerical review may also be conducted for potential matches, where a human examines pairs manually to decide the appropriate classification. Finally an evaluation of the results is conducted.</p>

To develop methodology for matching 3D images, we use a simplified framework illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 General framework ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At an individual record level, the data need to be pre-processed before useful features can be extracted. Pre-processing typically involves selecting and cleaning up the data fields. For cartridge cases, each record is an image, so the pre-processing steps are slightly more involved. The steps we use are 1) Automatically select breechface marks; 2) Level image; 3) Remove circular symmetry; 4) Filter. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tai and Eddy (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> we develop methodology for pre-processing 2D images; methodology for 3D images is adapted from the former.

We would like to remove all other areas from the analysis, in particular the firing pin impression. The breechface region is relatively flat and has a different depth from the the firing pin impression, since the latter is an indentation on the primer surface. This is obvious from the rightmost image. The solution that we have adopted is to fit a plane through the breechface region, ignoring the firing pin impression, and to select only points lying on or close to the plane.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We use an algorithm called RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fischler and Bolles, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">1981</a>)</cite> to achieve this, and the procedure used is outlined in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 Features for each record ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. RANSAC was developed to fit models in the presence of outliers. Briefly, we repeatedly fit planes to the image by sampling points on the image, and outliers are defined to be points lying outside some threshold from the fitted plane. The plane with the largest number of inliers (opposite of outliers) is chosen. These inliers are treated as being part of the breechface area.</p>

This step adjusts for the breechface surface being tilted on a plane during the image capturing process, and has been used in the literature (see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Vorburger et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Roth et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>). The same type of tilt in two images could result in high overall similarity, despite the two having no similar individual features. This is undesirable since one is less concerned with these overall patterns. To address this issue, we subtract the plane that was fit in the previous step, planar differences in depth. The residuals are used for further processing.

It is at this resolution that all further pre-processing is done. The next step is to adjust for the surface having differences in depth that are circular in nature. This adapts the methodology of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tai and Eddy (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>; here we show that the benefits transfer to topographical data, and provide the statistical details that were previously omitted. Analogous to the previous step, the base of the cartridge case could have differences in depth that are circular in nature. This could arise if the base of the cartridge case slopes inwards towards the center; looking at the second panel in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a><a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>, this does look to be the case. The step of removing circular symmetry corrects for these circular differences in depth, by fitting a model that captures the differences. The residuals are used for further processing.</p>

Since only the breechface marks are selected for analysis, treating the other regions as missing pixels, some fraction of the coefficients will not be computed, but the total number of coefficients is still very large. There are large local fluctuations in the model coefficients since many of them are estimated only using a small number of pixels (many basis functions only have four pixels, and many of the pixels are also missing due to the selection of the breechface area).

In this particular application, it is necessary to first align the two images to one another. Aligning images typically involves finding the best rotation and translation parameters (horizontal and vertical), where “best” means some metric is optimized, over all pixels or some subset of pixels. This optimization can be done either using a grid search or some other approximate means. The metric used might be correlation, mean-squared error, or something similar. Frequently, the optimized value of the metric is used as a similarity measure; this might be used on its own or combined with other similarity measures to produce a feature set for comparing two images.</p>

<div id="S3.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In record linkage, additional restrictions are sometimes imposed in the matching process. For example, a one-to-one constraint may be added, meaning that a record in database A can be matched to only one record in database B. Another common situation is when multiple pairwise comparisons are done independently, and there is a desire to eliminate intransitive links. For example, if A matches B and B matches C, but A does not match C, there is a conflict that needs to be resolved. Here we use hierarchical clustering to eliminate intransitive links, in situations where these intransitive links are undesirable. For example, we might be interested in comparing results of an automatic method with that of examiner proficiency tests. In these tests multiple samples from test fires using the reference firearm are provided as reference samples. Examiners need to determine if various questioned samples come from the same source as the reference samples. Essentially, this involves organizing samples into groups that examiners believe come from the same source. These are necessarily transitive in terms of pairwise comparisons, and is arguably a simpler task than getting each pairwise comparison correct. To compare these results accurately with results from an automated method would require that the latter also have transitive links. Additionally, reference data sets are often used in developing automated methods. Researchers perform all pairwise comparisons within these data sets, and if there are intransitive links there would be inconsistencies in the evaluation. A final argument for imposing the constraint of transitivity is that it can lead to better classifier performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The classification step generates predictions for whether pairs are matches or non-matches (depending on some cutoff). Similarly, after hierarchical clustering the comparisons can be evaluated on a pairwise level. Since the metadata provided in NIST’s database gives information on the source of each image, ground truth labels for whether pairs are from the same gun (a match or non-match) can be generated. One can use the same performance measures used in classification problems, at a pairwise level.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results are organized by type of data set. Of the 14 data sets studied, four involve consecutively manufactured pistol slides firing the same ammunition. The pistol slide is a component of the firearm that includes the breech block, and is hence responsible for the breechface marks. It had been suggested that pistol slides that were produced successively might have similar patterns and imperfections that persist through the manufacturing process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(see e.g., Lightstone, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, so cartridge cases obtained using such slides might be more difficult to differentiate. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lightstone (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> found that firearms examiners did not in fact have trouble comparing such cartridge cases, because even though the molds that were used to produce the slides did have markings that carried over through the manufacturing process, the individual characteristics on each slide were sufficient for examiners to make correct identifications to the individual slide. Here one can come to the same conclusion: in Figures <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.1 Classifier and clustering accuracy ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a><a href="#S4.F9.sf1" title="In Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.1 Classifier and clustering accuracy ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a> to <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.1 Classifier and clustering accuracy ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a><a href="#S4.F9.sf4" title="In Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.1 Classifier and clustering accuracy ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(d)</span></a> the method produces higher similarity scores for most comparisons belonging to the same pistol slide, than those involving different slides. All the plots show a very good separation between the true match and non-match distributions. At least for the combinations of firearm and ammunition studied, having pistol slides that are consecutively manufactured does not appear to pose a problem for automatic identification.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Now consider the Kong and De Kinder data sets, which involve multiple copies of the same firearm. Kong uses 12 Smith &amp; Wesson 10-10’s, firing Fiocchi ammunition. One might expect results to mimic those that involve consecutively manufactured slides, but this does not turn out to be the case; results are far worse. De Kinder on the other hand, uses 10 Sig Sauer P226’s, firing six different brands of ammunition, and the results also show extremely poor separation between match and non-match scores. From the Kong study, manually looking at examples of non-matched pairs producing very high scores (over .6), one observation is that the markings appear as small scratches, and are very much less pronounced compared to those in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a><a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>, say.

Overall, very good performance is achieved in 9 of the 13 data sets, where AUCs are over .9 using at least one linkage method. One might hypothesize as to why clustering improves performances. Minimax linkage, for example, selects a cluster center for each cluster, and members of the cluster need to be similar to this center but not necessarily to other members of the cluster. It is plausible that the cluster center is a particularly well-marked cartridge case, while other cluster members might have areas that are less well-marked.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We have so far been agnostic about the selection of a similarity cutoff to designate predicted matches and non-matches. This might be of interest in some situations. For example, one might be interested in selecting pairs above a cutoff for further manual investigation. Alternatively, a cutoff could be used to make a conclusion in criminal cases on whether a person should be implicated in a crime. The choice of cutoff depends on the goal and desired tradeoff between false negatives and false positives. In the first investigative case a lower cutoff might be set to ensure high recall, while in the second case a much higher cutoff might be necessary, since the costs associated with falsely implicating a suspect are disproportionately high.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose that for comparison with examiner proficiency tests, we are interested in producing a disambiguated data set where images are clustered based on whether they share a common source. This requires the selection of a cutoff as well as a linkage method. Figure <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 4.1.1 Classifier and clustering accuracy ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> shows the range of values of precision and recall that can be achieved using various cutoffs and different linkage methods. For the purposes of illustration we treat false negatives and false positives equally, and choose a cutoff that maximizes precision and recall; this corresponds to the value at the bend of the precision-recall curve. As for the linkage method, examining results from the different data sets, it appears that minimax and average linkage have good performance across the board. In addition, minimax linkage has the advantage of being interpretable, so minimax linkage is selected to generate final clusters. Using minimax linkage, a cutoff that works well for all data sets is around .4, so we select this value.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We illustrate the results using the NBIDE data set; one can repeat this analysis for any data set.
The NBIDE data set consists of a total of 144 images from 12 different guns. If the algorithm worked perfectly, one would expect to see 12 clusters of size 12. Instead, the cluster sizes are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.1.2 Final clusters ‣ 4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Now, comparing to ground truth, all 6 clusters of 12 are correct, and correspond to 4 Ruger firearms, and 2 Sig Sauers. The remaining 6 firearms comprise of combining two or more of the smaller clusters, with one exception: one cluster of size 4 mistakenly puts a cartridge case from a Smith &amp; Wesson firearm in a cluster containing cartridge cases from a different Smith &amp; Wesson firearm. In terms of performance by gun brand, it appears that from best to worst are Ruger, Sig Sauer, and then Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>

We mentioned that NIST has advocated for the use of 3D topographies. In this section we investigate how the individual pairwise comparison results differ for the two types of images, to investigate if the 3D representation does indeed produce superior results. The results presented in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 3D results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Automatically matching topographical measurements of cartridge cases using a record linkage framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> involve 14 different data sets.

We notice that there is no straightforward correspondence between the scores, and it is not uniformly the case that results in 3D are superior. For some of the consecutively manufactured data sets for example, the separation in match and non-match score distributions is actually better in 2D than in 3D. It is true in general however, that 3D produces better performance. 3D scores are generally higher than 2D scores, and high 2D scores generally correspond to high 3D scores. If the 2D score is low however, 3D scores span the entire range of values. For non-matches this is undesirable, but for matches the opposite is true, resulting in the overall better performance using 3D images.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Discussion and conclusion</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we develop methodology to match topographical measurements of cartridge cases. This methodology is both fully automatic and open source, and we evaluate it comprehensively on over 1,100 publicly-available images. We compare results to that using older reflectance microscopy images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We make several specific improvements over existing methods. First, the selection of breechface marks is automated using RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC). Removing circular symmetry during pre-processing removes artifacts like the slope of the primer surface downwards towards the center. This reduces the likelihood of spurious correlations. We standardize evaluation using precision-recall graphs, and attach a numerical summary by reporting the area under the curve. Finally, resolving intransitive links and generating a linked data set has not been given much thought in the forensics literature, and we propose ways to address this using ideas from the record linkage literature. We contribute a non-traditional application of record linkage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several domain-specific conclusions that are of interest are that performance using topographical measurements have better overall performance than reflectance images over a large number of data sets, but individual comparisons vary in quality. Excellent overall performance is achieved (area under the precision-recall curve of over .9) in 9 out of the 13 data sets studied. Performing the clustering step generally improved performance, particularly for data sets with middling to good (but not excellent) results. Performance is generally good on consecutively manufactured data sets, whereas other types of data sets could have much poorer performance. It is not possible to make general statements about particular gun or ammunition brands, since there is a lot of variability depending on the gun model and data collection effort. One clear conclusion from the variety of data sets analyzed, is that some specific firearm and ammunition combinations produce far superior results than others. More work needs to be done to investigate and explain these differences.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are at least two specific directions of future work that are essential if such methods are to be adopted for use in actual criminal cases. The first is to do a much more comprehensive comparison of the results of automatic methods with that of human examiners. There is some evidence to suggest that examiner performance might be related to algorithmic performance; for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lightstone (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> concludes that examiners did not have difficulty differentiating consecutively manufactured slides, and in this paper neither does an automatic method. Much more work needs to be done before reaching a definitive conclusion, but establishing a relationship between examiner and algorithmic performance would be beneficial in many ways. For example, data on examiner error rates are generally lacking, and results using automatic methods may serve as a guide to examiner error rates. Types of comparisons that are problematic for algorithms could suggest problems for examiners as well.
The second issue is to examine the fairness of automatic methods. As such methods have risen in popularity in forensic matching, there have been calls from government to consider this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Takano, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. In firearms matching, we have already seen large differences in performance depending on the data set studied. The first step would be do a proper accounting of these differences. Next and more importantly, is to examine if these translate into bias towards any particular group, for example through geography, or different costs of guns and ammunition resulting in different groups favoring certain types of guns or ammunition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, automatic methods have a lot of potential in terms of corroborating, enhancing, and possibly one day replacing examiner testimony. We have produced good results on many data sets, but these methods need to be tested much more extensively before being used in real cases, where there is the possibility of unintended harms, and where the consequences of falsely implicating a suspect are severe.</p>
