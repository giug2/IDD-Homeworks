<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies a federated edge learning system, in which an edge server coordinates a set of edge devices to train a shared machine learning (ML) model based on their locally distributed data samples. During the distributed training, we exploit the joint communication and computation design for improving the system energy efficiency, in which both the communication resource allocation for global ML-parameters aggregation and the computation resource allocation for locally updating ML-parameters are jointly optimized. In particular, we consider two transmission protocols for edge devices to upload ML-parameters to edge server, based on the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA), respectively. Under both protocols, we minimize the total energy consumption at all edge devices over a particular finite training duration subject to a given training accuracy, by jointly optimizing the transmission power and rates at edge devices for uploading ML-parameters and their central processing unit (CPU) frequencies for local update. We propose efficient algorithms to optimally solve the formulated energy minimization problems by using the techniques from convex optimization. Numerical results show that as compared to other benchmark schemes, our proposed joint communication and computation design significantly improves the energy efficiency of the federated edge learning system, by properly balancing the energy tradeoff between communication and computation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have found abundant applications in, e.g., computer vision, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. The recent success of AI and ML depends on various factors such as the development of new algorithms (e.g., deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>), the availability of massive data and the exponential increase of computation power. Normally, training proper AI/ML models requires huge computation power and massive training data. Therefore, the training of AI/ML models is conventionally implemented at the cloud or data center that has strong computation and storage capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With recent technical advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and fifth-generation (5G) celluar networks, massive data are generated by end devices (such as smart sensors, IoT devices, and smart phones) and cellular base stations (BSs) at the wireless network edge. In this case, the conventional centralized cloud learning may not be applicable any longer, as the collection of big data from massive edge devices to the central cloud is costly and may cause extremely high traffic loads in communication networks. Motivated by the recent development of mobile edge computing (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>), a new paradigm of distributed mobile edge learning has been proposed (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>), in which massive edge devices are enabled to cooperate in training shared ML models by exploiting their locally distributed data and computation power. By pushing ML tasks from far-apart cloud to nearby edge, the mobile edge learning technique can significantly decrease the end-to-end latency and considerably reduce the traffic loads in communication networks. It is envisioned that the mobile edge learning will be a key technology in the beyond-fifth-generation (B5G) or sixth-generation (6G) cellular networks for enabling new applications such as autonomous driving, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), thus realizing the network intelligence vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Among different mobile edge learning approaches, federated edge learning is particularly appealing (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>), which allows a central node (such as an edge server) to coordinate a large number of edge devices to cooperate in training shared ML models based on their locally distributed data samples. Generally speaking, the objective of federated edge learning is to find optimized ML-parameters by minimizing the loss function via distributed optimization. In particular, the distributed gradient descent method has been widely adopted to solve the loss-function minimization problem, which is implemented in an iterative manner as follows. At each (outer) iteration, the edge server first broadcasts the global ML-parameters to edge devices, such that all participating edge devices can synchronize their local ML-parameters; next, each edge device individually updates its local ML-parameters by computing the gradients based on their own data samples, where the local update is normally implemented over several (inner) iterations to speed up the convergence<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>; then, after local update, the edge devices upload their local ML-parameters to the edge server, such that the edge server can aggregate them to obtain an updated global ML-parameters. As the above procedures proceed, the edge server can obtain converged global ML-parameters that correspond to the desirable ML-model. For convenience, we refer to the above outer and inner iterations as global and local iterations, respectively. As no explicit data sharing from edge devices is required, the federated edge learning efficiently preserves the data privacy and security for edge devices. Notice that the ML-parameters are frequently exchanged between the edge server and edge devices, and as a result, the performance of federated edge learning is fundamentally constrained by the communication between the edge server and edge devices, especially when they are connected by wireless links that are unstable and may fluctuate significantly over time. This thus calls for a new design principle for federated edge learning in an interdisciplinary manner from both computer science and wireless communications perspectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, the implementation of federated edge learning over wireless networks faces the following technical challenges. First, due to the involvement of both communication and computation, how to jointly design them for optimizing the ML-training performance in terms of the training speed and accuracy is a new problem to be tackled. This problem is particularly difficult. This is due to the fact that the ML-training performance depends on many different factors (such as the employed ML algorithms and the data distribution among edge devices), and there does not exist a generic analytic relationship between the ML-training performance metric and the communication/computation parameters. Next, as the edge devices are normally powered by battery with finite sizes, their limited energy supply is another challenge to be dealt with, especially when the trained ML-model contains a large number of parameters, leading to heavy computation and communication loads. In addition, the federated edge learning faces the so-called straggler’s dilemma issue, i.e., the ML-training performance is limited by the slowest edge devices in communication and computation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, there have been some prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> investigating the communication-constrained federated edge learning systems from different perspectives. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed gradient compression methods to accelerate the training speed by reducing the required communication cost for exchanging gradients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> optimized the numbers of global and local iterations to maximize the ML-training accuracy, subject to the communication resource constraints. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> considered the heterogeneity of wireless channels at different edge devices, based on which a client selection algorithm was proposed to improve the efficiency of ML-model training, in which only the edge devices with good communication and computation qualities are chosen for avoiding the straggler’s dilemma. Furthermore, the so-called over-the-air computation approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is utilized in the federated edge learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, in which the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels is exploited for speeding up the global ML-model aggregation. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> further considered a hierarchical federated learning structure integrating devices, edge and cloud, in which multiple edge servers are allowed to perform partial ML-model aggregation to speed up the training process by reducing the direct communication rounds from the edge devices to the cloud. Despite such research progresses, however, the energy-efficient federated edge learning design by taking into account both communication and computation still remains a topic that is not well addressed. This thus motivates our investigation in this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers a federated edge learning system consisting of one edge server and multiple edge devices. With the coordination of the edge server, the edge devices use the distributed batch gradient descent (BGD) method to train a shared ML-model. Suppose that the ML-model training is subject to a given training delay requirement. Our objective is to minimize the energy consumption at edge devices during the training, by jointly designing their communication resource allocation (i.e., the transmission power and corresponding rates) for global ML-parameters uploading and aggregation, and computation resource allocation (i.e., the central frequency unit (CPU) frequencies) for local ML-parameters updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, we present both communication and computation energy consumption models, which are functions with respect to the numbers of local and global iterations, and the communication and computation loads at each iteration. We also consider two transmission protocols for the edge devices to upload their local ML-parameters to edge server, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA), respectively. Under the two transmission protocols, the formulated energy minimization problems are both non-convex and difficult to solve in general. To tackle this issue, we transform them into convex forms and then present efficient algorithms to solve them optimally. Numerical results reveal interesting tradeoffs among energy consumption, training speed and training accuracy. It is shown that our proposed joint communication and computation design achieves significant performance gains over other benchmark schemes without such joint optimization. It is also shown that properly choosing the numbers of global and local iterations can efficiently balance the communication-computation tradeoff for further enhancing the system energy efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Note that to our best knowledge, there have been two prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> considering the energy-efficient communication design for federated edge learning systems, which are different from this paper in the following aspects. First, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> only focused on the communication resource allocation, while this paper considers both communication and computation resource allocations. Next, different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> that aimed to minimize the weighted sum of training delay and energy consumption, this paper aims to minimize the energy consumption subject to training delay constraints. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> used a (loose) upper bound of the loss function to represent the training accuracy and to determine the numbers of local and global iterations, this paper uses simulations to accurately reveal the effects of the numbers of local and global iterations on training accuracy, and further shows the communication-computation energy tradeoff in choosing these parameters. Also note that the joint communication and computation resource allocations have been extensively investigated in the MEC literature (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>). Nevertheless, the MEC studies normally focused on the task execution delay as the performance metric under general
computation task models; while in the federated edge learning in this paper, we are interested in specific computation tasks for training ML-models, for which the training speed and accuracy are used as key performance measures.</p>

In order to model the energy consumption and delay for such computation, we use the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) to measure the computation complexity. For analytical convenience, it is assumed that the number of FLOPs<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span> How to obtain an accurate estimate of the number of FLOPs for each local update is an important task. Here, we explain how to estimate that for CNN, while those for other ML models (such as SVM and DNN) can be similarly obtained. In particular, a CNN generally consists of multiple fully-connected layers and convolutional layers. For each fully-connected layer, the number of FLOPs can be easily evaluated as the product of the inputs and outputs. For each convolutional layer, the number of FLOPs can be estimated as the product of various factors including the spatial width and height of the feature map, previous and current layers, and the width and height of the Kernel.

Therefore, the NOMA transmission protocol always leads to lower minimum training delay than the TDMA counterpart. Furthermore, it can be shown that any feasible solution of transmission power/rate and CPU frequencies to problem (P2) under the TDMA case is also an feasible solution to (P1) under the NOMA case, but the opposite may not be true. Therefore, it is expected that the NOMA transmission also achieves lower energy consumption than the TDMA transmission, as will be validated in Section VI.</span></p>

By contract, for the schemes with computation design only and training delay minimization, it is observed that increasing the maximum CPU frequency may lead to increased energy consumption. Furthermore, it is observed that for the two schemes with joint communication and computation design and communication design only, the NOMA transmission always outperforms the TDMA transmission in term of the energy efficiency; while for the other two schemes, NOMA may lead to higher energy consumption than TDMA.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the energy efficient operation of a federated edge learning system, in which two transmission protocols for ML-parameters uploading, namely NOMA and TDMA, were considered. We minimized the total communication and computation energy consumption at edge devices subject to a given training delay requirement, by jointly designing the communication and computation resource allocations. Although the formulated problems were non-convex, we transformed them into convex forms, and then presented efficient algorithms to solve them optimally. Numerical results revealed interesting tradeoffs among energy consumption, training speed and training accuracy. It was shown that our proposed designs achieve significant performance gains over other benchmark schemes without such joint optimization. It was also shown that properly choosing the numbers of global and local iterations during the distributed training further helps enhance the system energy efficiency by properly balancing the communication-computation energy tradeoff.</p>
