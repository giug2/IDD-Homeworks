<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study asynchronous federated learning (FL) in a wireless distributed learning network (WDLN). To allow each edge device to use its local data more efficiently via asynchronous FL, transmission scheduling in the WDLN for asynchronous FL should be carefully determined considering system uncertainties, such as time-varying channel and stochastic data arrivals, and the scarce radio resources in the WDLN.
To address this, we propose a metric, called an effectivity score, which represents the amount of learning from asynchronous FL. We then formulate an Asynchronous Learning-aware transmission Scheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the effectivity score and develop three ALS algorithms, called ALSA-PI, BALSA, and BALSA-PO, to solve it.
If the statistical information about the uncertainties is known, the problem can be optimally and efficiently solved by ALSA-PI. Even if not, it can be still optimally solved by BALSA that learns the uncertainties based on a Bayesian approach using the state information reported from devices.
BALSA-PO suboptimally solves the problem, but it addresses a more restrictive WDLN in practice, where the AP can observe a limited state information compared with the information used in BALSA. We show via simulations that the models trained by our ALS algorithms achieve performances close to that by an ideal benchmark and outperform those by other state-of-the-art baseline scheduling algorithms in terms of model accuracy, training loss, learning speed, and robustness of learning. These results demonstrate that the adaptive scheduling strategy in our ALS algorithms is effective to asynchronous FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, a massive amount of data is generated from devices, such as mobile phones and wearable devices, which can be used for a wide range of machine learning (ML) applications from healthcare to autonomous driving. As the computational and storage capabilities of such distributed devices keep growing, distributed learning has become attractive to efficiently exploit the data from devices and to address privacy concerns. Due to the emergence of the need for distributed learning, federated learning (FL) has been widely studied as a potentially viable solution for distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
FL allows to learn a shared central model from the locally trained models of distributed devices under the coordination of a central server while the local training data at the devices is not shared with the central server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the central server and the devices should communicate with each other to transmit the trained models.
For this, a wireless network composed of one AP and multiple devices has been widely considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and the AP in the network plays the role of the central server in FL.
FL is operated in multiple rounds. In each round, first, the AP broadcasts the current central model. In typical FL, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> devices substitute their local models into the received central one and train them using their local training data.
Then, the locally trained model of each device is uploaded to the AP and the AP aggregates them into the central model.
This enables training the central model in a distributed manner while avoiding privacy concerns because it does not require each device to upload its local training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, as FL has been implemented in wireless networks, the limited radio resources of wireless networks have been raised as a critical issue since the radio resources restrict the number of devices that can upload the local models to the AP simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
To address the issue, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, device scheduling procedures for FL have been proposed in which the AP schedules the devices to train their local models and upload them considering the limited radio resources.
Then, in each round, only the scheduled devices do so and the AP aggregates the local models uploaded from the scheduled devices.
On the other hand, the not-scheduled devices do not train their local models and their local data that have been arrived during the round is stored for future use.
Hence, every locally trained model in each round is synchronously aggregated into the central model in the round (i.e., once a device trains its local model in a round, it must be aggregated into the central model in that round and its use in future rounds is not allowed), and such FL is called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synchronous</span> FL in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Device scheduling procedures in synchronous FL have effectively addressed the issue of the limited radio resources in wireless networks, but at the same time, they may cause the inefficiency of utilizing local computation resources and the loss of local data due to too much pileup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
These issues are raised because of the not-scheduled devices in each round that do not train their local models.
Hence, to address them, we can allow even the not-scheduled devices to train their local models and store them for future use.
This enables each device to continually train its local model by using the arriving local data in an online manner, which avoids waste of local computation resources and too much pileup of the local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
However, at the same time, when aggregating the stored locally trained models, it causes the time lag between the stored local models and the current central model due to the asynchronous local model aggregation.
In the literature, such FL with the time lag is called <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">asynchronous</span> FL.
In addition, such devices who store the previous locally trained models are typically called <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stragglers</span>, and when aggregating them into the central model, they may cause an adverse effect to the convergence of the central model because of the time lag <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, in the ML literature, several works on asynchronous FL have addressed the harmful effects from the stragglers which inevitably exist due to network circumstances such as time-varying channels and scarce radio resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
They introduced various approaches which address the stragglers when updating the central model and the local models; balancing between the previous local model and current one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, adopting dynamic learning rates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and using a regularized loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
However, they mainly focused on addressing the incurred stragglers and did not take into account the issues relevant to the implementation of FL, which are related to the occurrence of the stragglers.
Hence, it is necessary to study an asynchronous FL procedure in which the key challenges of implementing asynchronous FL in a wireless network are carefully considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">When implementing FL in the wireless network, the scarcity of radio resources is one of the key challenges. Hence, several existing works focus on reducing the communication costs of a single local model transmission of each edge device; analog model aggregation methods using the inherent characteristic of a wireless medium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, a gradient reusing method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and local gradient compressing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, other existing works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>
focus on scheduling the transmission of the local models for FL in which only scheduled edge devices participate in FL.
Since typical scheduling strategies in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> do not consider FL, for effective learning, various scheduling strategies for FL have been proposed based on traditional scheduling policies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, scheduling criteria to minimize the training loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, an effective temporal scheduling pattern to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and multi-armed bandits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. They allow the AP to efficiently use the radio resources to accelerate FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, these existing works on FL implementation in the wireless network have been studied only for synchronous FL, and do not consider the characteristics of asynchronous FL, such as the stragglers and the continual online training of the local models, at all.
Nevertheless, the existing methods on reducing the communication costs can be used for asynchronous FL since in asynchronous FL, the edge devices should transmit their local model to the AP as in synchronous FL.
On the other hand, the methods on scheduling the transmission of the local models may cause a significant inefficiency of learning if they are adopted to asynchronous FL.
This is because most of them consider each individual FL round separately and do not address transmission scheduling over multiple rounds.
In asynchronous FL, each round is highly inter-dependent since the current scheduling affects the subsequent rounds due to the use of the stored local models from the stragglers.
Hence, the transmission scheduling for asynchronous FL should be carefully determined considering the stragglers over multiple rounds.
In addition, in such scheduling over multiple rounds, the effectiveness of learning depends on system uncertainties, such as time-varying channels and stochastic data arrivals.
In particular, the stochastic data arrivals become more important in asynchronous FL since the data arrivals are directly related to the amount of the straggled local data due to the continual online training.
However, the existing works do not consider stochastic data arrivals at edge devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study asynchronous FL considering the key challenges of implementing it in a wireless network.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study asynchronous FL in a wireless network.
Specifically, we propose an asynchronous FL procedure in which the characteristics of asynchronous FL, time-varying channels, and stochastic data arrivals of the edge devices are considered for transmission scheduling over multiple rounds.
The comparison of our work and the existing works on transmission scheduling in FL is summarized in Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ I Introduction ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
We then analyze the convergence of the asynchronous FL procedure.
To address scheduling the transmission of the local models in the asynchronous FL procedure, we also propose a metric called an <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">effectivity score</span>. It represents the amount of learning from asynchronous FL considering the properties of asynchronous FL including the harmful effects on learning due to the stragglers.
We formulate an asynchronous learning-aware transmission scheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the effectivity score while considering the system uncertainties (i.e., the time-varying channels and stochastic data arrivals).
We then develop the following three ALS algorithms that solve the ALS problem:</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, an ALS algorithm with the perfect statistical information about the system uncertainties (ALSA-PI) optimally and efficiently solves the problem using the state information reported from the edge devices in the asynchronous FL procedure and the statistical information.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Second, a Bayesian ALS algorithm (BALSA) solves the problem using the state information without requiring any a priori information. Instead, it learns the system uncertainties based on a Bayesian approach. We prove that BALSA is optimal in terms of the long-term average effectivity score by its regret bound analysis.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Third, a Bayesian ALS algorithm for a partially observable WDLN (BALSA-PO) solves the problem only using partial state information (i.e., channel conditions). It addresses a more restrictive WDLN in practice, where each edge device is allowed to report only its current channel condition to the AP.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="S1.p8.2" class="ltx_p">Through experimental results, we show that ALSA-PI and BALSAs (i.e., BALSA and BALSA-PO) achieve performance close to an ideal benchmark with no radio resource constraints and transmission failure.
We also show that they outperform other baseline scheduling algorithms in terms of training loss, test accuracy, learning speed, and robustness of learning.</p>

To solve this problem, in asynchronous FL, every device trains parameters by using its locally available data in an online manner for efficient learning on each device and avoiding too much pileup of the local data.
Then, partial devices are scheduled to transmit the trained parameters to the AP.
By using the received parameters from the scheduled devices, the AP updates its parameters.
We call the parameters at the AP central parameters and those at each device local parameters.
The details of how to update the local and central parameters in asynchronous FL are provided in the following.</p>

In asynchronous FL, the local gradient which has not been transmitted in the previous rounds will be aggregated to the current local gradient.
Such local gradients not transmitted in the previous rounds are called delayed local gradients.
In the literature, the devices who have such delayed local gradients are called <span id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.17.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stragglers</span>.
It has been shown that they adversely affect model convergence since the parameters used to calculate the delayed local gradients are different from the current local parameters used to calculate the current local gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

In the WDLN, the local data stochastically and continually arrives at each device and the device trains its local parameters in each round by using the arrived data.
Due to the scarce radio resources of the WDLN, it is impractical that all devices transmit their local parameters to the AP simultaneously.
Hence, FL in the WDLN becomes asynchronous FL and the devices who will transmit their local parameters in each round should be carefully scheduled by the AP for training the central parameters effectively.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.10" class="ltx_p">We now propose an asynchronous FL procedure for the WDLN in which the central and local parameter update strategies introduced in the previous subsection are adopted.
In the procedure, the characteristics of the WDLN, such as time-varying channel conditions and system bandwidth, are considered as well.
This allows us to implement asynchronous FL in the WDLN while addressing the challenges due to the scarcity of radio resources in the WDLN.

However, various aspects in learning, such as a learning speed and a robustness to stragglers, are not directly shown in this theorem, and they may appear differently according to transmission scheduling strategies used in the asynchronous FL procedure as will be shown in Section <a href="#S5" title="V Experimental Results ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now formulate an asynchronous learning-aware transmission scheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the performance of FL learning.
In the literature, it is empirically shown that the FL learning performance mainly depends on the local update of each device, which is determined by the arrived data samples at the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
However, it is still not clearly investigated which characteristics in a local update bring a larger impact than others to learn the optimal parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, it is hard for the AP to exploit information relevant to the local updates because the AP cannot obtain the local updates before the devices transmit them to the AP and cannot access the data samples of the devices due to the limited radio resources and privacy issues.
Due to these reasons, instead of directly finding the impactful local updates, the existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> schedule the transmissions according to the factors in the bound of the convergence rate of FL, which implicitly represent the impact of the local updates in terms of the convergence.
However, as pointed out in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, the existing works on transmission scheduling for FL do not consider asynchronous FL over multiple rounds.
As a result, their scheduling criterion based on the convergence rate may become inefficient in asynchronous FL since in a long-term aspect with asynchronous FL, the deterioration of the central model’s convergence due to the absence of some devices in model aggregation can be compensated later thanks to the nature of asynchronous FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Contrary to the existing works, we focus on maximizing the average number of learning from the local data samples considering asynchronous FL.
The number of data samples used in learning can implicitly represent the amount of learning.
Roughly speaking, a larger number of data samples leads the empirical loss in (<a href="#S2.E1" title="In II-A Central and Local Parameter Updates in Asynchronous FL ‣ II Wireless Distributed Learning Network with Asynchronous FL ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) to be converged into a true one in the real-world.
It is also empirically accepted in the literature that more amount of data samples generally results in better performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
In this context, in FL, the number of the local samples used to calculate the local gradients represents the amount of learning since the central parameters are updated by aggregating the local gradients.
However, in asynchronous FL, the delayed local gradients due to scheduling or transmission failure are aggregated to the current one, which may cause an adverse effect on learning.
Hence, here, we maximize the total number of samples used to calculate the local gradients aggregated in the central updates while considering their delay as a cost to minimize its adverse effect on learning.</p>

Roughly speaking, the metrics try to maximize the number of data samples used in learning the transmitted local updates since it maximizes the convergence rates of the central model according to the convergence analysis of synchronous FL.
Similar to this, the proposed effective score tries to maximize the number of data samples used in learning the successfully transmitted local updates to maximize the amount of learning conveyed to the AP.
However, at the same time, it tries to minimize the number of data samples used in learning the delayed local updates to minimize their adverse effects, while the conventional metrics do not introduce any penalty due to the delayed local updates.</span></p>

Then, based on the transition probabilities, the problem in (<a href="#S3.E16" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) can be optimally solved by standard dynamic programming (DP) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
However, this is impractical since it is hard to obtain such a priori information in advance.
Besides, even if such a priori information is perfectly known, the computational complexity of the standard DP methods is too high as will be shown in Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="IV-E Comparison of Computational Complexity ‣ IV Asynchronous Learning-Aware Transmission Scheduling ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-E</span></span></a>.
Hence, we need a learning approach such as reinforcement learning (RL) that learns the information while proceeding the asynchronous FL, and develop algorithms based on it in the following section.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we develop three ALS algorithms each of which requires different information to solve the ALS problem:
an ALS algorithm with perfect a priori information (ALSA-PI), a Bayesian ALS algorithm (BALSA), and a Bayesian ALS algorithm with a partially observable state information (BALSA-PO).
We summarize the information required in ASLA-PI, BALSA, and BALSA-PO in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Asynchronous Learning-Aware Transmission Scheduling ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
In the table, we can see that from ALSA-PI to BALSA-PO, the required information in those three algorithms is gradually reduced.</p>

For the prior distribution, the non-informative prior can be typically used if there is no prior information about the system parameters. On the other hand, if there is any prior information, then it can be defined by considering the information. For example, if we know that a parameter belongs to a certain interval, then the prior distribution can be defined as a truncated distribution whose probability measure outside of the interval is zero.
We then define the Bayesian regret of BALSA up to time <math id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.8.m8.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> as</p>

Besides, it is expected that the number of devices participating in FL is typically much larger than the capacity of wireless networks that represents the number of devices that can transmit the local updates simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.

On the other hand, the channel gains may not require such data transmissions in an uplink case since the AP can estimate the channel gains of the devices by using the pre-defined reference signals transmitted from the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
In this context, in this section, we consider a WDLN in which in each round, the AP observes the channel gain <math id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\mathbf{h}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">𝐡</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1.1">𝐡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.5.m5.1c">{\mathbf{h}}</annotation></semantics></math> only and the numbers of the aggregated samples <math id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\mathbf{n}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">𝐧</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝐧</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.6.m6.1c">{\mathbf{n}}</annotation></semantics></math> are not reported to the AP.
We can model this as a partially observable MDP (POMDP) based on the description in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Problem Formulation ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, but the POMDP is often hard to solve because of the intractable computation.
In this section, we develop an algorithm to solve the ALS problem in the partially observable WDLN by slightly modifying BALSA, which is called BALSA-PO.</p>

The DP-based algorithm with perfect a priori information requires to run one of the standard DP methods once to compute the optimal policy for the system parameters in the perfect information.
For the complexity analysis to compute the optimal policy, we consider the well-known value iteration whose computational complexity is given by <math id="S4.SS5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math"

Besides, the DP-based algorithms have much larger computational complexities than BALSAs in terms of not only the asymptotic behavior but also the complexity coefficients in the Big-O notation since the DP-based algorithms require a complex computations based on the Bellman equation while BALSAs require only the computations to update posteriors in (<a href="#S4.E27" title="In IV-C BALSA: Optimal Bayesian ALS without a Priori Information ‣ IV Asynchronous Learning-Aware Transmission Scheduling ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>) and to sort the expected number of samples.
From the analyses, we can see that the complexity of BALSAs is significantly lower than that of the DP-based algorithms.
The computational complexities of the algorithms are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-D BALSA-PO: Bayesian ALS for Partially Observable State Information ‣ IV Asynchronous Learning-Aware Transmission Scheduling ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

Note that Bench is not provided in the figure since in Bench, all devices transmit their local updates and all the transmissions succeed.
From the figure, we can see that our BALSAs achieve the similar effectivity score to that of ALSA-PI, which is the optimal one.
In particular, as the round proceeds, the effectivity scores of BALSAs converge to that of ALSA-PI.
This clearly shows that our BALSAs can effectively learn the uncertainties in the WDLN.

Hence, in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Training Loss and Test Accuracy ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Adaptive Transmission Scheduling in Wireless Networks for Asynchronous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we show the robustness of the algorithms against the stragglers more clearly through the training loss and test accuracy results of a single simulation instance.
First of all, it is worth emphasizing that Bench is the most stable one in terms of the stragglers because it has no straggler.

This clearly shows that a transmission scheduling algorithm may cause unstable learning if its scheduling strategy is biased without considering the stragglers.</p>

For the MNIST dataset, we vary the target accuracy from 0.7 to 0.95, and for the CIFAR-10 dataset, we vary it from 0.48 to 0.72.
The test accuracy satisfaction rate of each algorithm is obtained as the ratio of the simulation instances, where the test accuracy of the corresponding trained model exceeds the target accuracy at the end of the simulation, to the total simulation instances.
For the average required rounds for satisfying the target accuracy, we find the minimum required rounds of each simulation instance in which the target accuracy is satisfied.
To avoid the effect of the spikes, we set a criteria of satisfying the target accuracy as follows: all test accuracies in three consecutive rounds exceed the target accuracy.

From the figures, we can see that the algorithms considering asynchronous FL (ALSA-PI and BALSAs) require the smaller rounds to satisfy the target accuracy.
This clearly shows that the algorithms that consider the effective score of asynchronous FL (i.e., ALSA-PI and BALSAs) have a faster learning speed than the algorithms that do not consider it (i.e., RR and <math id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">W</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑊</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">W</annotation></semantics></math>-max).</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed the asynchronous FL procedure in the WDLN and investigated its convergence.
We also investigated transmission scheduling in the WDLN for effective learning.
To this end, we first proposed the effectivity score of asynchronous FL that represents the amount of learning in which the harmful effects on learning due to the stragglers are considered.
We then formulated the ALS problem that maximizes the effectivity score of asynchronous FL.
We developed ALSA-PI that can solve the ALS problem when the perfect a priori information is given. We also developed BALSA and BALSA-PO that effectively solve the ALS problem without a priori information by learning the uncertainty on stochastic data arrivals with a minimal amount of information.
Our experimental results show that our ALSA-PI and BALSAs achieve the similar performance to the ideal benchmark. In addition, they outperform the other baseline scheduling algorithms.
These results clearly show that the transmission scheduling strategy based on the effectivity score, which is adopted to our algorithms, is effective for asynchronous FL.
Besides, our BALSAs effectively schedules the transmissions even without any a priori information by learning the system uncertainties.
As a future work, a non-i.i.d. distribution of data samples over devices can be incorporated into the ALS problem for more effective learning in a non-i.i.d. data distribution scenario.
In addition, subchannel allocation and power control can be considered to minimize the time consumption for the FL update procedure by utilizing the resources more effectively in asynchronous FL.</p>
