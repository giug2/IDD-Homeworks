<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study how to optimize the federated edge learning (FEEL) in UAV-enabled Internet of things (IoT) for B5G/6G networks, from a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach.
The federated learning is an effective framework to train a shared model between decentralized edge devices or servers without exchanging raw data, which can help protect data privacy.
In UAV-enabled IoT networks, latency and energy consumption are two important metrics limiting the performance of FEEL. Although most of existing works have studied how to reduce the latency and improve the energy efficiency, few works have investigated the impact of limited batteries at the devices on the FEEL.
Motivated by this, we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can adjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid withdrawing from federated learning training untimely.
We optimize the system by jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in time-varying environments.
To solve this optimization problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based strategy, where a linear combination of latency and energy consumption is used to evaluate
the system cost. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed strategy outperforms the conventional ones. In particular, it enables all the devices to complete all rounds of FEEL with limited batteries and meanwhile reduce the system cost effectively.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a non-negligible role in Internet of things (IoT) for beyond the fifth-generation (B5G) and the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless mobile networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Due to the mobility and flexibility, UAVs can effectively collect data and communicate in the edge computing-based IoT networks. Thanks to these advantages, UAVs have been widely used in many application scenarios, such as environmental monitoring, emergence communication, transportation control and remote sensing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning has shown its great success on speech recognition, computer vision and many other domains.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Especially in the era of big data, millions or billions of data are collected by various sensors and are applied to train the deep learning model. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed a large-scale hierarchical database for image classification and promoted the emergence of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
CNN models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Large amounts of high-quality data are the key to improve the performance of the deep learning model. As a matter of fact, data collection faces a series of challenges. Though a lot of data are produced by heterogeneous devices, especially
IoT devices and smartphones in the mobile edge, these data are fragmented and scattered in various devices. This brings out a huge communication cost to
centralize data on the server to train models when we adopt the traditional centralized training method of deep learning. Meanwhile,
increasing concerns of sensitive privacy make data collection more difficult. People do not want their personal data (e.g. figs, voice, chat history) to be uploaded to others’ servers. There are also some companies, banks and hospitals with a lot of sensitive data which are not allowed to divulge. Moreover, laws on privacy protection have been promulgated continuously. Due to these reasons, data are difficult to be centralized to train deep learning models, which is called “data island” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this context, federated learning has been proposed to break the “data island” and it makes full use of each device’s data to train a model with a fine performance. In the federated learning, all devices use local data to train a model and share the model on the premise of safety to aggregate a global model with the federated optimization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the edge computing-based IoT networks, in order to speed up the process of training and inference of deep learning,
a new concept “Edge AI” was presented to bring model closer to the places where data are generated when the computational capabilities of edge devices
are continually growing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Federated learning is also applied to train deep learning models cooperatively
in MEC networks, which is referred to as federated edge learning (FEEL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Google Inc<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> used an edge server to
build a keyboard input prediction model based on FEEL, and FEEL can be also applied to improve the performance of content caching without
gathering users’ data centrally for training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the FEEL has been successfully applied to many application scenarios, there still exist some challenges. One major challenge is that there is a high requirement for the latency and energy consumption in UAV-enabled IoT networks, which is one of the important and critical issues. More importantly, UAVs are powered by limited batteries
and they can only work for a few dozen minutes. It is dangerous for UAVs to run out of power when they are working and it is of vital importance to control the remaining power. On the other hand, enough participants are the guarantee of the performance for the FEEL training. With a limited battery power, how to complete more training rounds of federated learning is an unconsidered issue and it is our motivation to control batteries effectively to prolong their service life.
Accordingly, in this paper we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can adjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid withdrawing from federated learning training untimely. We optimize the system by jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in time-varying environments. To solve this optimization problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based strategy, where a linear combination of latency and energy consumption is used to evaluate
the system cost. The main contributions of this work are summarized below.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Mobile Edge computing networks:</span> With the explosive growth of the number of IoT devices in 5G and 6G era,more and more data are mainly generated in the mobile edge, and mobile edge computing (MEC) is used to process a large quantity of data with a lower latency and energy consumption<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Many researchers focus on the offloading strategy in MEC to reduce system cost (e.g. Zhao<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>
optimized the computation offloading based on the discrete particle swarm algorithm, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> studied the multi-user computational offloading
and Li<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a DRL based approach to solve the problem of offloading for multiuser and multi-CAP MEC networks and so on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>)

<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL in the wireless networks:</span> In MEC networks, there are many existing works about reducing
the latency and energy consumption by allocating the system resources. But federated learning
is basically distributed and heterogeneous, and it needs to synchronize all the participants with different channel conditions and
computational capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Hence, another challenge is how to reduce the cost of FEEL. In this direction, Takayuki <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed
a client selection scheme for federated learning in mobile edge to accelerate the training. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the
authors studied the federated learning in wireless networks and tried to allocate more bandwidth to nodes with poor channel
or weak computational capabilities. Due to the lack of continuous connection between the UAV swarms,
a joint powered allocation design was proposed to optimize the convergence of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> presented worker-centric model selection for federated learning in the MEC networks. Zhou<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-based FL framework in the B5G network.
So far, few works have considered that most of the IoT devices are powered by limited batteries. Zhan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> executed DRL to adjust the CPU-frequency
making a good trade-off between the latency and energy consumption. But this work did not quantify the amount of battery power.</p>

Moreover, the system cost measured by the latency and energy consumption should be minimized, which is particularly important for the IoT devices.
By taking into account these factors, we can optimize the training rounds and system cost by adjusting the CPU-frequency and bandwidth. The system optimization problem can be given by</p>

It is generally very hard to solve the above optimization problem by using
conventional optimization methods such as convex optimization. Especially, in a time-varying environment, the base CPU-frequency
and channel condition are different in each round, causing heterogeneity in the training process. Due to these reasons,
a learning based algorithm should be developed to adapt to different states in order to find a proper solution.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In the considered FEEL scenario, the CPU-frequency and bandwidth allocation vary over a continuous range with infinite possibilities.
Accordingly, although deep Q-learning network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> can deal with the problem of discrete and low-dimensional action space, it is unable to work
efficiently in the face of continuous action space since its performance severely relies on finding the maximum of value function approximated by the neural network in each iteration.
Due to this reason, we turn to use the DDPG strategy to solve the optimization problem of CPU-frequency and bandwidth allocation. Deterministic Policy Gradient<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> was proposed to output a deterministic action,
instead of the value of all the actions under the actor-critic framework. Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Markov Decision Process ‣ IV DDPG-Based Allocation Strategy ‣ Battery-constrained Federated Edge Learning in UAV-enabled IoT for B5G/6G Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the actor-critic framework in the DDPG,
where a deep neural network called actor network is used to produce a deterministic
action while a critic network is employed to approximate the value-function
which evaluates the action.

In order to ensure the outputs in the correct range, the Sigmoid and Softmax activation functions
are used in the last layer of network. Before each round of FEEL training, clients need to report their available resources such as the base CPU-frequency and
remaining battery power to the server. At the same time, the server should estimate the channel parameters of the links from it to the users.
These information is entered as the input of the main actor network to get a deterministic action of adjusting
the practical CPU-frequency and bandwidth allocation. The base station will inform participants the operating CPU-frequency and the available wireless bandwidth
to them. The agent will achieve different rewards in each round according to the latency, energy consumption and the current number of rounds.

We focus on the total reward in each episode. From this figure, we can find that the curve of the total reward grows very fast in the first
200 episodes and then it continues to increase with a slow growth tendency. After about 500 episodes,
the proposed DDPG approach can achieve an asymptotic reward value of about 4000. These results can help verify the proposed
DDPG-based strategy.</p>

From this figure, we can observe that
at the beginning of episode, the battery-constrained devices are easily to run out of power and can only participate in about 500 rounds.
When the episode increases, the devices can participate in more rounds of training. This is because that with the learning of
DDPG agent, the proposed resource allocation strategy continues to improve and all the devices can prolong the life of their batteries.
When the curve is converged, all the devices can complete 1000 rounds of training. This can not only ensure the performance of training, but also avoid the danger caused by shutdown.</p>

We use the static strategy to compare since in the practical time-varying scenario,
it is however difficult to determine how to set the proper operating CPU-frequency of devices, and the devices should run
at a proportion of base CPU-frequency in order to reduce the energy consumption.
From this figure, we can see that the proposed strategy remains unchanged with the adjustment factor,
and it can enable all the devices to complete 1000 rounds of training.
In contrast, the static strategy can only obtain about 200 rounds of training when the adjustment factor is around 1, since
all the devices
operate at the base CPU-frequency with a high energy consumption.
When the adjustment factor decreases, the static strategy can enable all devices to reduce the energy consumption and
take part in more rounds of training.
In particular, the static approach can achieve 1000 rounds of training when the adjusting factor is smaller than 0.3.
The comparison results in this figure can further verify the effectiveness of the proposed DDPG strategy.</p>

We can find from this figure that the system cost of the proposed DDPG strategy remains unchanged
with the adjustment factor, which is similar to the phenomena in Figs. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V Simulations and Discussions ‣ Battery-constrained Federated Edge Learning in UAV-enabled IoT for B5G/6G Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>-<a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V Simulations and Discussions ‣ Battery-constrained Federated Edge Learning in UAV-enabled IoT for B5G/6G Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
In contrast, the static approach is affected by the adjustment factor significantly.
Specifically, the system cost of the static approach becomes smaller when the adjustment factor increases in a low region of adjustment factor.
This is due to the energy saving, which however leads to a huge latency.
On the contrary, the system cost of the static approach becomes larger when the adjustment factor increases in a high region of adjustment factor.
This is because that the pursuit of reducing latency leads to a great energy consumption.
In particular, the static approach achieves the minimum system cost when the adjustment factor is 0.3, which is still higher than that of the proposed DDPG strategy.</p>

For comparison, we plot the performance of the proposed DDPG strategy with even bandwidth allocation, denoted by E-DDPG.
From this figure, we can find that the proposed DDPG outperforms E-DDPG, since the former can exploit the wireless bandwidth resources in the learning process,
which can help improve the system performance. Moreover, E-DDPG is much better than the static approach, since the later cannot utilize the system communication and computational resources efficiently.
In further, the system performance of all the three strategies increases with a larger number of users, as more uses impose a heavier burden on the training process.</p>

From this figure, we can see that
the performances of the three strategies become better when the bandwidth increases, since a larger
bandwidth can help reduce the transmission latency as well as the transmission energy consumption.
Moreover, the proposed strategy outperforms the static approach and E-DDPG for various values of wireless bandwidth,
since it can exploit the system communication and computational resources efficiently. In particular,
when the total bandwidth is 1MHz, the cost of the proposed DDPG strategy, E-DDPG and the static approach
is about 130, 140, and 170, respectively. In further, when the bandwidth increases, the transmission latency becomes negligible in the system cost for the proposed DDPG
and E-DDPG strategies, which makes the performance gap between these two strategies decrease. The results in this figure demonstrate the
merits of the proposed DDPG strategy furthermore.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studied how to optimize the FEEL in UAV-enabled IoT networks where UAVs had limited batteries, from a deep reinforcement learning approach. Specifically, we provided an optimization framework where the devices could adjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid withdrawing from federated learning training untimely, through jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in time-varying environments. To solve this optimization problem, we employed the DDPG based strategy, where a linear combination of latency and energy consumption was used to evaluate the system cost. Simulation results were demonstrated to show that the proposed strategy could efficiently avoid devices withdrawing from the FL training untimely and meanwhile reduce the average system cost.</p>
