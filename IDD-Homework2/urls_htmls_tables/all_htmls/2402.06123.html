<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">In the resource-constrained IoT-edge environment, Split Federated (SplitFed) learning is implemented to enhance training efficiency. This method involves each IoT device dividing its full DNN model at a designated layer into a device-side model and a server-side model, then offloading the latter to the edge server. However, existing research overlooks four critical issues as follows: (1) the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities and the sizes of their local data samples impact training efficiency; (2) the influence of the edge server’s computation and network resource allocation on training efficiency; (3) the data leakage risk associated with the offloaded server-side sub-model; (4) the privacy drawbacks of current centralized algorithms. Consequently, proactively identifying the optimal cut layer and server resource requirements for each IoT device to minimize training latency while adhering to data leakage risk rate constraint remains a challenging issue. To address these problems, this paper first formulates the latency and data leakage risk of training DNN models using Split Federated learning. Next, we frame the Split Federated learning problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming challenge. To tackle this, we propose a decentralized Proactive Model Offloading and Resource Allocation (DP-MORA) scheme, empowering each IoT device to determine its cut layer and resource requirements based on its local multidimensional training configuration, without knowledge of other devices’ configurations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the DP-MORA scheme effectively reduces DNN model training latency, enhances training efficiency, and complies with data leakage risk constraints compared to several baseline algorithms across various experimental settings.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have facilitated tremendous progress across a wide smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as intelligent transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and smart home <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In these smart IoT applications, large volumes of data generated by IoT devices is often private and sensitive. To utilize sensitive data to train DNN models in a safe manner, federated Learning (FL) as a privacy preserving machine learning technique, is introduced<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. FL collaborates multiple IoT devices to train a DNN model in a distributed manner while keep data locally. In FL framework, each IoT device loads a full DNN model and parallelly train its local DNN model based on local data samples, and then aggregate its local model to form a global model in an edge server. Thus, FL can obtain a DNN model without exposing sensitive data, thereby greatly satisfying data privacy requirement. However, due to the limited resource capacities of IoT devices, federated learning can suffer from two major problems: (1) IoT device with limited memory capacity could not afford to run the DNN model whose total training memory footprint exceeds the memory capacity of a single IoT device; (2) The mismatch between weak computation capacity of IoT device and prohibitive computation workload of DNN model training leads IoT-oriented FL to time-consuming and ineffective. To address these two problems, split federated (SplitFed) learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is introduced to split each IoT device’s full DNN model at a cut layer into a device-side model and a server-side model and offload the server-side model to the resource-adequate edge server and achieve device-edge synergy training, consequently alleviating the aforementioned two problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Research problem about utilizing SplitFed learning to enable IoT-oriented FL to run on resource-constrained IoT devices and further improve training efficiency of IoT-oriented FL has attracted much attention in academia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, existing studies mainly exist a few major problems:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(1) Most studies have failed to consider that the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities and their local data samples size on the training efficiency. If allocating the same sub-model to each IoT device, the weaker IoT device with more local data samples need to spend more time in training models, inevitably prolonging the total training latency and reducing the training efficiency of FL. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> split DNN model on each IoT device at the same cut layer and train the DNN model in parallel or sequentially.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(2) Most studies have failed to consider the impact of the edge server’s computation and network resource allocation on the training efficiency. In device-edge synergy training, multiple resource-constrained IoT devices connected to an edge server for distributed DNN model training share network resource and computing resource of the edge server. An efficient resource allocation can further reduce the training latency and improve the training efficiency. Otherwise, the total training latency can be prolonged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(3) Most studies have failed to consider the data privacy leakage problem. Existing studies offload server-side sub-model to edge server from resource-constrained IoT devices, thereby accelerating the DNN model training. However, it is possible to recover raw sample data from the knowledge of the gradient parameter of offloaded server-side sub-model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Hence, it can incur data privacy leakage when offload server-side sub-model to server for device-edge synergy training. Therefore, it is necessary to design an appropriate model offloading strategy to trade off computation efficient of FL and its data leakage risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(4) Most studies adopt centralized algorithms to identify the optimal cut layer for IoT devices with different resource capacities. The formulation and solution of the centralized optimization problem itself is a detriment on privacy. That is because that the centralized algorithms are generally built on the complete knowledge regarding all IoT devices’ multiple dimensional training configurations,
including the computation capacity, the mini-batch size, the size of local dataset and the number of epoches, etc. Hence, it may not possible in many real-world smart applications exploiting SplitFed learning. It is more realistic for each IoT device to decide the cut layer and the required resource according to its local multiple dimensional training configuration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims to address the above problems, with a particular focus on reducing the overall training time while satisfying the data leakage risk rate constraint. We firstly present a system architecture. We then formulate the latency and data leakage risk of DNN model training adopting split federated learning. The DNN model training process consists of multiple rounds, each of which consists of <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Starting Phase</em>, <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Intermediate Phase</em> and <em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">End Phase</em> three stages. We characterize the latency for these three stages and the total training latency in one training round, respectively. We next adopt a data-riven methodology to fitting the forward/backward propagation workloads, the smashed data/the smashed data’s gradient size, and the device-side model’s data size as functions of the cut layer, respectively. Based on these, we formulate the split federated learning problem as a mixed integers non-linear programming. To solve this problem, we design a decentralized proactive model offloading and resource allocation (DP-MORA) scheme which enables each IoT device to decide its own cut layer and resource requirement according to its own private information without knowing other IoT devices’ private information. Finally, extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that compared with several baselines algorithms, the newly proposed DP-MORA scheme can reduce the total training latency while satisfying the data leakage risk rate constraint.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In resource-constrained IoT-edge environment, split federated learning enables each resource-constrained IoT device to split its local full DNN model into device-side model and service-side model at the cut layer and offload the service-side model to the edge server, thereby achieving device-edge synergy training and improving training efficiency. How to identify the optimal cut layer to accelerate model training in resource-constrained IoT-edge environment has attracted much attention in academia. There are a lot of studies about exploiting split federated learning to accelerate DNN model training in a distributed manner.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For efficiency-oriented device-edge synergy training, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a novel federated split learning framework to efficiently train models on distributed sequential data. Analogously, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> designed two schemes, called SplitFedv1 and SplitFedv2, to amalgamates split learning and federated learning two approaches, and sequentially train the client/server-side models. These two schemes accelerate local training in resource constrained IoT devices by offloading partial layer of the DNN model to edge server. However, the work manually determine the same cut layer for each IoT device’s local DNN model and have failed to consider the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities. To address the shortcoming for the identical sub-models on heterogeneous IoT devices, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> in view of the computational heterogeneity and changing network bandwidth, adopted reinforcement learning to adaptively identify the optimal cut layer for each IoT device’s local DNN model. Its main goal is to reduce the training latency. Analogously, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> designed an approach to dynamically determine the optimal cut layer according to the state of the communication channel, and thereby improving the efficiency of model inference. The authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed adaptive resource-aware split-learning scheme in IoT systems to trade off the training latency and energy consumption. Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a local-loss-based split learning to optimally split the model and train the client/server-side models in parallel, aiming at to reduce the training latency. Although the aforementioned works adaptively identify the cut layers for multiple heterogeneous IoT devices to improve the training efficiency, they have failed to take the data leakage risk into account. Therefore, these solutions cannot be directly applied to data privacy requirement IoT-edge environment.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For an efficiency and privacy-oriented device-edge synergy training, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> pre-train a regression model to identify the optimal cut layer and evaluate the privacy leakage risk rate by server-side model parameter quantities. To trade off the training efficiency and the data leakage risk, a federated synergy learning paradigm is proposed. However, the work only use the device-side model size to measure the privacy leakage, which lack effective demonstration in real data reconstruction attacks. To cope with this problem, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a metric called inverse efficiency to measure privacy leakage. Based on this, they formulated model decomposition with privacy constraint in hybrid split learning and federated learning as a constraint optimization problem and transformed it into a contextual bandit problem. To address this problem, an efficient contextual bandit learning-based scheme is developed to identify the optimal cut layers for IoT devices, aiming to optimize the training latency and data privacy protection. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a novel learning architecture that combines split learning and federated learning two approaches to improve the training efficiency and data privacy. Analogously, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a new hybrid Federated Split Learning architecture to trade off privacy protection and the training latency. Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed to binaries the device-side model to reduce its computation workload and memory usage. To further preserve privacy, they integrated differential privacy into the binaries split learning model and trained it with additional local leak loss. Its main goal is to lightweight model and preserve privacy. Although the aforementioned works have jointly considered the cut layer selection and privacy leakage, there is still no work to consider the impact of edge server’s resource allocation on the training efficiency. Moreover, the aforementioned works adopted the centralized algorithms to identify the optimal cut layer of each individual IoT device. The formulation of the centralized optimization problem itself is a detriment on privacy.</p>

Specifically, the cut layer not only affects the computation workload distribution and the transmission data amount between the IoT device and the edge server, but also affects the data leakage risk rate. Different cut layer have different amounts of transmission data. A shallow cut layer means light computational workload on IoT devices, but high data leakage risk. A deep cut layer means heavy computation workloads on IoT devices, but low data leakage risk. We further quantify the data leakage risk in next subsection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Subsection 3.2, in the overall training latency model, some functions including the forward propagation workload function with respect to the cut layer, the backward propagation workload function with respect to the cut layer, the smashed data size function with the respect to the cut layer, the smashed data’s gradient size with the respect to the cut layer, the device-side model’s data size with respect to the cut layer, cannot be expressed in an analytic form. This is because that these functions vary with different DNN mdoels. For example, the specific coefficients in the above these functions are different for Restnet 18 and Restnet 34 two models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenge, referring to the existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, we adopt a data-driven methodology. We first empirically measure the forward/backward propagation workloads, smashed data/smashed data’s gradient sizes, and device-side model’s data size with respect to different cut layers for Restnet 18 and Restnet 34 two models. Then we employ a variety of classic regression models to profile the above relationships. We find that it is optimal to adopt Quadratic Polynomial Regression (QPR) regression models to profile the functions between the forward/backward propagation workloads, the device-side model size and the cut layer. Also, it is optimal to adopt Reciprocal Regression (RR) to profile function between the smashed data/smashed data’s gradient size and the cut layer. The developed regression models for Restnet 18 and Restnet 34 two models are shown in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3.4 Regression-based modeling methodology ‣ 3 System model ‣ Decentralized Proactive Model Offloading and Resource Allocation for Split and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
The root mean square error (RMSE) is applied for calculating the average model-prediction error in the units of the variable of interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In resource-constrained heterogeneous edge environment, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities and their local data samples’ size, it is necessary to split the local DNN model of each IoT device at different cut layers, and then offload different service-side models to the edge server to achieve device-edge synergy learning. In addition, in device-edge synergy learning, the network and computation resources’ limitation of the edge server shared by IoT devices, it is also necessary to efficiently allocate the sharing resource to further reduce the DNN training latency. Here, we formulate a joint model offloading and resource allocation problem as a mixed integers non-linear programming problem. Its main goal is to reduce the total training latency while satisfying data leakage risk rate constraints.

That is because that the centralized algorithms are generally built on the complete knowledge regarding all IoT devices’ multiple dimensional training configurations, including the computation capacity, the mini-batch size, the size of local dataset and the number of epochs, etc. Hence, it may not suitable for many real-world smart applications exploiting SplitFed Learning. It is urgent to design a novel DP-MORA scheme which enables each IoT device to decide its own cut layer and resource requirement according to its own multiple dimensional training configuration without knowing other IoT devices’ multiple dimensional training configurations.</p>

on the training efficiency. In this paper, we jointly consider the problem of cut layer selection and resource allocation. Since there is no related resource allocation policy, we select two typical resource allocation scheme:</p>

That is because that the DP-MORA scheme can identify the optimal model offloading and resource allocation strategy which allocate the powerful IoT device with less local data samples less bandwidth resources and computation resources, and allocate the less capable IoT device with more local data samples more bandwidth resources and computation resources, thereby thereby reducing the waiting latency for less capable IoT device with more local data samples and improving the training efficiency. Otherwise, if the bandwidth resource and computing resource of the edge server are equally divided to each IoT device, the weaker IoT device with more local data samples need to spend more time in training models, inevitably incurring more waiting latency and the total training latency, thereby reducing the training efficiency.</p>

The reason for the DP-MORA scheme with lowest waiting latency is that the DP-MORA scheme can identify the optimal model offloading and resource allocation scheme considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities and their local data samples’ size. The reason for FSAF and FAAF with the highest waiting latency is that they collaborate multiple IoT devices with the edge server to train DNN model in a sequential way, thereby incurring long training latency. The reason for SF3AF, FSAF and FAAF with the medium waiting latency is that they train DNN model in a parallel manner. Specifically, SF3AF adopt the same model offloading strategy as the DP-MORA, but it does not consider the impact of efficient resource allocation on training latency. FSAF offloads the identical server-side sub-model to the edge server for device-edge synergy training in a parallel manner. However, it not only fails to consider the heterogeneity of IoT devices’ resource capacities and their local data samples’ size, but also fails to consider the edge server’s resource allocation. FAAF train the whole DNN model on local IoT devices in parallel. However, it does not fully exploit the resource-adequate edge server to achieve efficient device-edge synergy training.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.2 Performance evaluation of the proposed DP-MORA scheme ‣ 7 Performance evaluation ‣ Decentralized Proactive Model Offloading and Resource Allocation for Split and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we can see that the total training latency of the DP-MORA scheme gradually decreases as the data leakage risk rate constraint increases. That is because different data leakage risk rate constraints correspond to different cut layers requirement. The higher the data leakage risk rate constraint is, the shallower the cut layer is, thereby the solution space of the optimization problem with minimizing training latency while satisfying the data leakage risk rate constraint is larger. The DP-MORA scheme has a higher probability to identify the optimal solution from the larger feasible solution space. The optimal solution is the optimal cut layer and resource requirement for each IoT device. The optimal solution splits the DNN model at an optimal shallow cut layer and offload the server-side sub-model with more layers to the resource-adequate edge server, and allocates optimal bandwidth resource for the transmission data and optimal computation resource for the server-side sub-model, thereby obtaining lower training latency. On the contrary, when the data leakage risk rate constraint is low, it indicates that IoT devices have a low tolerance for data leakage. Based on this, only several deep cut layers of the DNN model can be selected to meet the data leakage risk rate constraint. A deep cut layer means heavy computation workloads on resource-constrained IoT devices and light computational workload on resource-adequate edge server, which incurring a longer training latency.</p>

The main reason is that the edge server with the higher computation capacity can cooperate IoT devices to handle more workloads, and thereby reducing the per-round training latency. The per-round training latency of FAAF over Resnet 18 and Restnet 34 two models are constant with the increase of the edge server’s computation capacity. That is because that FAAF train the whole DNN model on local IoT devices in parallel. Therefore, the increase of the edge server’s computation capacity has no effect on the training latency of FAAF.</p>

In order to examine the impact of edge server’s downlink bandwidth on the per-round training latency, we vary the edge server’s downlink bandwidth from 50Mbps to 200Mbps. The related experimental results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.2 Performance evaluation of the proposed DP-MORA scheme ‣ 7 Performance evaluation ‣ Decentralized Proactive Model Offloading and Resource Allocation for Split and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. We see that when the edge server’s downlink bandwidth increases, the per-round training latency of the DP-MORA scheme and other benchmarks decreases. The main reason is that it takes less time to transmit the same amount of data with the larger uplink bandwidth.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate the training efficiency of split federated (SplitFed) learning while satisfying the data leakage risk rate constraint in resource-constrained IoT-edge environment. To address this problem, we first formulate the latency of DNN model training and measure the data leakage risk rate of DNN model training adopting split federated learning. Then we formulate joint model offloading and resource allocation problem to be a mixed integers non-linear programming. At last, we design a decentralized and privacy-preserving joint model offloading and resource allocation scheme to optimize the per-round training latency while satisfying data leakage risk rate constraint. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance. Extensive experiments show that the DP-MORA scheme can effectively reduce the per-round training latency while satisfying the data leakage risk rate constraint.</p>
