<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a decentralized learning paradigm wherein a central server trains a global model iteratively by utilizing clients who possess a certain amount of private datasets.
The challenge lies in the fact that the client-side private data may not be identically and independently distributed, significantly impacting the accuracy of the global model.
Existing methods commonly address the Non-IID challenge by focusing on optimization, client selection and data complement.
However, most approaches tend to overlook the perspective of the private data itself due to privacy constraints.
Intuitively, statistical distinctions among private data on the client side can help mitigate the Non-IID degree.
Besides, the recent advancements in dataset condensation technology have inspired us to investigate its potential applicability in addressing Non-IID issues while maintaining privacy.
Motivated by this, we propose DCFL which divides clients into groups by using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) method, then uses dataset condensation methods with non-IID awareness to complete clients.
The private data from clients within the same group is complementary and their condensed data is accessible to all clients in the group.
Additionally, CKA-guided client selection strategy, filtering mechanisms, and data enhancement techniques are incorporated to efficiently and precisely utilize the condensed data, enhance model performance, and minimize communication time.
Experimental results demonstrate that DCFL achieves competitive performance on popular federated learning benchmarks including MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 with existing FL protocol.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the proliferation of Internet of Things devices, Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising machine learning paradigm. In FL, many clients collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server, while keeping the training data local <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Due to FL’s great privacy protection, communication reduction for processing voluminous distributed data, high scalability, and other excellent advantages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, it has received extensive attention in academia and industry.
At present, FL has been widely used in Keyboard Word Spotting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, Diver Activity Recognition (DAR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, Speech Recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Health Monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and other domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, Non-Identical and Independently Distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> (note: aka statistical heterogeneous, data heterogeneity or Non-IID), as the distribution of the client’s local data is not representative of the distribution of the overall data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, results in FL tasks to become more complex and meet some challenges.
The Non-IID issue causes the training process of the server model to more fluctuate, leads to more communication rounds between clients and server, and degrades the final model performance drastically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
According to Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the reduction in the test accuracy of FedAvg for Non-IID data up to 11.31% in MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, 51.31% in CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, 54.5% in KWS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, researchers have devised FL methods from diverse perspectives to mitigate the negative effects caused by data heterogeneity:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the perspective of the FL optimization method, Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed FedProx, which is based on FedAvg and introduces an additional L2 regularization penalty term in the local objective function to restrict the disturbance to the global server model aggregation from participated clients whose model trained on the highly Non-IID local dataset.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed FedNova, which adopts a normalized averaging method that eliminated objective inconsistency.
Karimireddy et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed Scaffload which uses control variates or variance reduction to correct for the client-drift caused by data heterogeneous in its local updates.
While those methods outperform FedAvg and contemporary FL methods in Non-IID scenarios, however, these methods have limitations: They don’t consistently outperform other algorithms in all Non-IID data settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and they can’t influence the inherent Non-IID properties of clients. Besides, they adopt the traditional random participant selection strategy to select clients without considering the data distribution complementary of clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">From the perspective of client selection strategies, there are many works that mainly focus on System Heterogeneity, such as computation capacity, communication capacity, or both, in order to get as many clients as possible involved in the training process and reduce communication time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Few of them try to select clients based on analyzing the statistically complementary relationship between clients, like the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> who divides clients into several groups based on Group Earth Mover’s Distance(GEMD), the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> utilizes weight divergence to recognize the data heterogeneity degree of client data.
To some extent, those works take advantage of the heterogeneous information of the client’s private data, but they don’t solve the inherent Non-IID issue.
From the perspective of data completion, Zhao Y et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose only 5% globally shared data can increase the accuracy of the CIFAR-10 dataset up to 30%, Ma J et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposes to share a distribution information version of client private local dataset which alleviate the negative effect of Non-IID data on the training performance in some degree.
Data complementation works directly from the data itself to achieve better performance.
However, the above approaches compromise the fundamental principles of user privacy protection and are thus limited to specific FL scenarios.
In most practical settings, accessing client data or local data distribution information as supplementary data is prohibited.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, while data complementarity is a promising solution to alleviate the Non-IID problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, its communication burden and privacy challenges still hinder its widespread application.

DCFL aims to mitigate the negative impacts of Non-IID data on FL model training, communication, and performance by using condensed data efficiently and precisely.
Instead of the conventional scheme where the server randomly selects a fraction of clients to participate in FL training  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, we take a novel viewpoint on client data complementarity and use that information to guide participant selection.
Measuring the complementarity of client data is a crucial challenge since accessing or transferring client data distribution is prohibited due to privacy and confidentiality concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) is a method that can be used to measure the similarity between representational layers of different clients’ local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, making it an ideal fit for assessing the complementarity of client data.
Specifically, DCFL starts by maintaining a table that records the correlation between each client model and other selected client models.
Further, we endeavor to utilize the table to facilitate the training of the local model by selected clients with relatively less bias and full knowledge, through the utilization of auxiliary data from other clients. The deeper problem is how to get the auxiliary data from complemented clients.
In the traditional FL implementation process, we can only get weights or gradients from participating clients.
Motivated by condensed data obtained by data condensation methods owns informative, representative, small quantity features and no fear of privacy violation, we resort to utilizing condensate data from selected clients as a backbone to be delivered between the server and clients.
Besides, Data filtering and data augmentation are also employed, to utilize the condensed data with Non-IID awareness, further improve the final model performance, and reduce the total communication rounds in the implementation of DCFL.</p>

The CKA method is introduced to obtain the complementarity between clients, which guides client selection and condensed data transfer in DCFL.
Specifically, the server-side calculates complementarity between each client and all other clients utilizing CKA, then the clients are grouped according to the complementarity.
According to that, we can fine-grained select participating clients, further reduce the overall communication cost, and achieve better final model performance.
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DCFL is the first effort to apply CKA to client grouping, client selection, and condensed data utilization.</p>

When the client model is training, real data from the client and the complement condensed data with or without filtering by the server from the same complement group’s clients collaborate.
Additionally, the DSA data augmentation technique, which is popular in data condensation methods, is used throughout the training process and the participating clients’ weight calculation formula on the server side is reorganized according to changes in clients’ local dataset quantity.
The above mechanisms not only further reduce the communication wheel, making the training process more stable but also ultimately achieve a better final model performance.</p>

How to reflect weight divergence efficiently and reasonably, the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> sheds light on this problem, applying CKA as the alternative measure method of weight divergence to expose how the data heterogeneity affects each layer of a deep classification model and find there exists a greater bias in the classifier than other layers.
While they further propose a novel algorithm Classifier Calibration with Virtual Representations(CCVR) and achieve excellent performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10 datasets, they neglect to further infer the distribution relationship between clients and don’t further consider the use of CKA to guide client selection instead of traditional random client selection.
Motivated by the above discovery, we dig deeper to propose using CKA to measure weight divergence and data complementarity between clients which only uses the partial model parameters of the classifier to calculate so that further reduce communication bandwidth and computation time cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To vividly understand and verify our assumption: the data similarity and complementary relationship between different clients can be derived from model weight similarity measurement methods, like CKA.
We perform an experimental study on clients with heterogeneous datasets.
For the sake of simplicity and representativeness, we chose CIFAR-10 with 10 clients and chose a convolutional neural network with four layers.
As for the Non-IID setting, we partition the data according to the Dirichlet distribution, we set the 10 clients into 5 groups, and the group list which each group contains a certain amount of clients is [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]. The detailed data distribution of clients is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A CKA-based client complementarity ‣ II Design details ‣ DCFL: Non-IID awareness Data Condensation aided Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

The lower valuation means more differences between clients’ data distribution. For example, we can see client 0 is similar to client 1 and is highly different from client 5 and client 6.</p>

The server sends requests to clients, and then the clients can choose to send back information that contains condensed data or not according to their availability.
When the server obtains a certain quantity of information after T request rounds,
it can then use those condensed data to train the model instead of traditional random weight model initialization to further reduce communication rounds;
In the stage of client-server communication, selected clients who never take part in training process before will be asked to send condensate data and whole model parameter to the server for extending server’s knowledge (Line 23 – 26 of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II Design details ‣ DCFL: Non-IID awareness Data Condensation aided Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
According to the complementary relationship, the server sends the latest model and condensed data from complementary clients to selected clients who have taken part in the training process before (Line 28 – 30 of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II Design details ‣ DCFL: Non-IID awareness Data Condensation aided Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

Before we adopted this organization method, we tried different methods for using condensed data like mingling synthetic data and local private data as a whole for training or freezing model parameters and using synthetic data or real local data to fine-tune the classifier or more layers.
After comparing the aforementioned methods, we found the currently adopted training method is the most effective and beneficial for model training.
We also find Differentiable Siamese Augmentation method proposed by DSA can also be applied in DCFL to preprocess clients’ local training data and received synthetic data before training (Line 8 and Line 20 of Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ II Design details ‣ DCFL: Non-IID awareness Data Condensation aided Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) which significantly improves the final model performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Datasets</span>. In this paper, we evaluate the image classification performance of the final model which is obtained through the whole process of DCFL. So we conduct experiments on four datasets including MNIST, Fashion MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, SVHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and CIFAR10.
MNIST and Fashion MNIST consist of 28×28 gray-scale training images of 10 classes. SVHN and CIFAR10 contain 30k and 50k 32×32 training images from 10 categories respectively. We adopt the most representative and model-disturbing approach to divide the training data for clients - data partitioning with Dirichlet distribution Dir<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.SS1.p1.3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">k</span></sub>(a) (aka the label distribution skew <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>). In this data split method, K is the number of clients and alpha determines the Non-IID level. A smaller value of alpha means a more unbalanced data distribution. We take two different scenarios of data distribution into consideration, including Dir<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.SS1.p1.3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">20</span></sub>(0.1), Dir<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.SS1.p1.3.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">20</span></sub>(0.5). Besides, we also adopt quantity-based label imbalance data partition method (aka pathological Non-IID), like  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, to extend a highly extreme scenario, where each client only has data samples with two label in our setting.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Experimental Settings</span>.
For CIFAR-10 and SVHN, we adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN),
which is the typical deep neural network and commonly applied in FL.
Specifically, we set two 5 x 5 convolution layers followed by max-pooling layers and two fully connected layers with ReLU activation, same to the structure mentioned by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For MNIST and Fashion MNIST, we adopt a simple multi-layer perceptron network.</p>

Take SVHN as an example, when the distribution of training data is Dir<sub id="S3.SS3.p2.35.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.SS3.p2.35.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">20</span></sub>(0.1), the average number of classes per client (cpc) is 4.6.

Based on the objectives applied to mimic target data or to find a proxy model that learns synthetic datasets by optimizing their features and corresponding decoders, dataset condensation methods can be divided into a Meta-Learning Framework, Data Matching Framework, and Factorized Dataset Distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Some works, like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> use kernel to get synthetic data, while effective but time-consuming;
Some works, like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> directly matched the long-range trajectory between the target dataset and the synthetic dataset instead of single gradient matching, so that the computational overhead of training and storing expert trajectories is quite high.
Due to the comprehensive consideration of computing cost, memory usage, and the specific features of FL, we use DC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, DM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, DSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> as our dataset condensation methods in DCFL.</p>

CKA provides an effective way to measure similarities between deep neural network representations, which takes the complex interaction between the training dynamics and structured data into account. Few pieces of literature that apply CKA to Federated learning, but rarely of they further consider the use of the derived CKA indexes to reflect the complementary of privately owned datasets between different clients. For example, Mi Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> used the CKA to measure the similarity between the representations from the same layer of different clients’ local models and found there exists a greater bias in the classifier than other layers, they didn’t use that information to further deduce the peer-to-peer dataset complementary relationships, while to post-calibrate the classifier after federated training. In this paper, we use CKA from a novel perspective to guide client selection and condensed data utilization.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel implementation framework of federated learning - DCFL to achieve faster convergence, stabilize the model training process, and better model performance. By using the CKA-based client complementarity method to guide group division clients and then condensed data-assisted client model training with Non-IID awareness, we have reduced the communication rounds to reach convergence. However, there is still a need for relatively costly computation time to obtain condensed data locally, and can’t apply complex datasets, like CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, in DCFL due to the limitations of current data condensation methods. How to reduce the computation time to get the synthetic set and apply the framework to more complex datasets can be potential future directions.</p>
