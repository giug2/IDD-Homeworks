<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), as an emerging edge artificial intelligence paradigm, enables many edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data.
To enhance the training efficiency of FL, various algorithms have been proposed, ranging from first-order to second-order methods.
However, these algorithms cannot be applied in scenarios where the gradient information is not available, e.g., federated black-box attack and federated hyperparameter tuning. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a derivative-free federated zeroth-order optimization (FedZO) algorithm featured by performing multiple local updates based on stochastic gradient estimators in each communication round and enabling partial device participation.
Under non-convex settings, we derive the convergence performance of the FedZO algorithm on non-independent and identically distributed data and characterize the impact of the numbers of local iterates and participating edge devices on the convergence.
To enable communication-efficient FedZO over wireless networks, we further propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) assisted FedZO algorithm.
With an appropriate transceiver design, we show that the convergence of AirComp-assisted FedZO can still be preserved under certain signal-to-noise ratio conditions.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedZO algorithm and validate the theoretical observations.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), a massive amount of data is generated and collected by various edge devices (e.g., sensors, smart phones). Because of the limited radio spectrum resource and increasing privacy concerns, gathering geographically distributed data from a large number of edge devices into a cloud server to enable cloud artificial intelligence (AI) may not be practical. To this end, edge AI has recently been envisioned as a promising AI paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Unlike cloud AI that relies on a cloud server to conduct centralized training, edge AI exploits the computing power of multiple edge devices to perform model training with their own local data in a distributed manner.
Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, as a representative edge AI framework, enables multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging their local data, which effectively alleviates the communication burden and privacy concerns. Nowadays, FL has found application in various fields, including autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, healthcare informatics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a result of the popularity of FL, the federated optimization problem for model training has attracted a growing body of attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Various algorithms have been proposed to attain a fast convergence rate and reduce the communication load, including both first- (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, FedPD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>) and second-order algorithms (e.g., FedDANE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>).
Most existing algorithms rely on gradient and/or Hessian information to solve the federated optimization problem.
However, such information cannot be obtained in scenarios where the analytic expressions of the loss functions are unavailable, such as federated hyperparameter tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or distributed black-box attack of deep neural networks (DNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In other words, existing algorithms cannot tackle federated optimization problems when gradient information is not available.
This motivates us to develop a communication-efficient federated zeroth-order optimization algorithm that does not require gradient or Hessian information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Parallel with the research on algorithm design for FL, the implementation of FL over wireless networks is also an emerging research topic. Random channel fading and receiver noise raise unique challenges for the training of FL over wireless networks.
Guaranteeing the learning performance with limited radio resource is a challenging task, which requires the joint design of the learning algorithm and communication strategy. Along this line of research,
the authors in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> studied the joint resource allocation and edge device selection to enhance learning performance.
Both studies adopted the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, where the number of edge devices that can participate in each communication round is restricted by the number of available time/frequency resource blocks.
The limited radio resource turns out to be the main performance bottleneck of wireless FL.
Fortunately, over-the-air computation (AirComp), as a non-orthogonal multiple access scheme, allows concurrent transmissions over the same radio channel to enable low-latency and spectrum-efficient wireless data aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, thereby mitigating the communication bottleneck <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Motivated by this observation, various AirComp-assisted FL algorithms were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to achieve fast model aggregation, wherein all of them adopted first-order optimization algorithm.
There still lacks a thorough investigation on AirComp-assisted FL with zeroth-order optimization.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider a federated optimization problem, where the gradient of the loss function is not available. We propose a derivative-free federated zeroth-order optimization algorithm, named FedZO, whose key features are performing multiple local updates based on a stochastic gradient estimator in each communication round and enabling partial device participation.
We establish a convergence guarantee for the proposed FedZO algorithm and study its implementation over wireless networks with the assistance of AirComp, which is challenging for the following reasons. First, although executing multiple local iterates in each communication round reduces the communication overhead, it also increases the discrepancies among local models due to the data heterogeneity and may even lead to algorithmic divergence. To reduce the communication overhead while preserving the convergence, the relationship between the convergence behavior and the number of local iterates needs to be characterized.
Second, the stochastic gradient estimator adopted in FedZO is not an unbiased estimate of the actual gradient, as demonstrated in<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
These unique features together with multiple local iterates and partial device participation per communication round make the existing convergence analysis framework for FedAvg not applicable to the proposed FedZO algorithm.
Third, to characterize the convergence of the AirComp-assisted FedZO algorithm, the impact of the random channel fading and receiver noise in global model aggregation needs to be further taken into account. This not only complicates the convergence analysis but also poses a new problem for the communication strategy design.
In this paper, we develop a unified convergence analysis framework to address the aforementioned challenges.

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The study of FL started from the seminal work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where the authors proposed a communication-efficient federated optimization algorithm known as FedAvg. Subsequently, various articles established convergence guarantees for the FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Following the FedAvg algorithm, many other first-order methods have been proposed, e.g., FedPD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and FedSplit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
To further reduce the communication overhead, several second-order optimization algorithms were proposed, such as FedDANE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and GIANT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Although the aforementioned first- and second-order algorithms have broad applications, there are still many FL tasks where the gradient and Hessian information are unavailable and thus require zeroth-order optimization.</p>

Based on single-point and Kiefer-Wolfowitz type gradient estimators, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed two distributed zeroth-order algorithms over time-varying graphs.
It is worth noting that the aforementioned works mainly consider the peer-to-peer architecture while the studies on the central-server-based architecture are very limited.
Moreover, most of the existing distributed zeroth-order algorithms focused on full device participation, which may not be practical for FL systems with limited radio resources and a large number of edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">AirComp has recently been adopted to support the implementation of FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, where channel fading and receiver noise inevitably distort the model aggregation, and in turn introduce a detrimental impact on the learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
The convergence behavior of various FL algorithms, e.g., vanilla gradient method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and stochastic gradient method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, showed that the channel fading and noise perturbation typically introduce a non-diminishing optimality gap, which can be mitigated by transmit power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, beamforming design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a joint learning and transmission scheme to ensure global convergence for strongly convex problems. By utilizing the communication strategy in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> developed an AirComp-assisted accelerated gradient descent algorithm.
Despite the above progress, the existing works focused on the first-order method, while there is no relevant literature studying the AirComp-assisted zeroth-order optimization algorithm.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the proposed FedZO algorithm adopts a similar framework as the FedAvg algorithm, the convergence analysis of the latter cannot be directly extended to that of the FedZO algorithm. The key factor hindering the extension is that the gradient estimator does not preserve specific properties of the stochastic gradient. For instance, the gradient estimator (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In 2nd item ‣ II-C FedZO Algorithm ‣ II Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization ‣ Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) is not an unbiased estimate of the true gradient.
Besides, the existing theoretical analysis framework for the distributed zeroth-order optimization method cannot be applied to the FedZO algorithm as existing zeroth-order algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> do not consider multiple steps of local model updates and partial device participation.
A larger number of local iterates reduces the communication overhead, but also increases the local model discrepancies and may even lead to algorithmic divergence.
To preserve convergence for the developed FedZO algorithm, it is necessary to bound these discrepancies by appropriately choosing the number of local updates, i.e., <math id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="H" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">H</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝐻</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">H</annotation></semantics></math>.

However, these schemes may not be spectrum-efficient as the number of required resource blocks or the communication latency linearly increases with the number of participating edge devices.
AirComp, as a new non-orthogonal multiple access scheme for scalable transmission, allows all edge devices to concurrently transmit their local model updates and exploits the waveform superposition property to achieve spectrum-efficient model aggregation. The communication resource needed for model uploading using AirComp is independent of the number of participating edge devices.
Hence, we adopt AirComp for the aggregation of local model updates in this paper.</p>

It is worth noting that the communication overhead introduced by the exchange of these scalars is negligible when compared with the transmission of high-dimensional model parameters.</p>

This ensures that the distortion between the obtained signal and the desired signal, i.e., the scaled receiver noise, is proportional to the maximum of the squared norm of local updates. This distortion diminishes when the local model converges. In other words, with such a transmitter design, the detrimental effect of the noise can be eliminated as the iteration proceeds for a convergent algorithm.</span></p>

Note that the analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> concentrates on the first-order algorithm under the strongly convex setup and relies on the assumption that the second-order moment of the stochastic gradient is bounded by a constant, which is restrictive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and not required in this paper.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The robustness of machine learning (ML) models is an important performance metric for their practical application. For example, in an image classification model, the prediction results of the ML model are expected to be the same as the decision that humans make.
In other words, the same output should be generated by a robust model if the input image is perturbed by a noise imperceptible to human.
To evaluate the robustness of ML models, black-box attacks can be adopted, where the adversary acts as a standard user that does not have access to the inner structure of ML models and can only query the outputs (label or confidence score) for different inputs.
This situation occurs when attacking ML cloud services where the model only serves as an API. Due to the black-box property, the optimization of black-box attacks falls into the category of zeroth-order optimization.</p>

Note that DZOPA was proposed for the peer-to-peer architecture which cannot be directly applied to our considered server-client architecture.
For comparison, we depict the performance of DZOPA under a fully-connected graph.
For fairness, we also upgrade the two-point stochastic gradient estimator of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to a mini-batch-type one as in (<a href="#S2.Ex2" title="II-B Preliminaries on Stochastic Gradient Estimator ‣ II Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization ‣ Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>).

With a larger number of local updates, the attack loss of the FedZO algorithm decreases much faster than that of the baselines.</p>

As can be observed, increasing the number of edge devices gives rise to a better convergence speed.
We can observe the speedup in the number of participating devices, which matches well with our analysis in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Convergence Analysis for FedZO ‣ Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.</p>

As the FedZO algorithm only relies on the zeroth-order information, the slightly decreased performance is reasonable, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the FedZO algorithm.
This also shows that the FedZO algorithm can serve as a satisfactory alternative for the FedAvg algorithm when the first-order information is not available.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a derivative-free FedZO algorithm to handle federated optimization problems without using the gradient or Hessian information. Under non-convex settings, we characterized its convergence rate on non-i.i.d. data, and demonstrated the linear speedup in terms of the number of participating devices and local iterates. Subsequently, we established the convergence guarantee for the AirComp-assisted FedZO algorithm to support the implementation of the proposed algorithm over wireless networks.
Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed FedZO algorithm and showed that the FedZO algorithm could serve as a satisfactory alternative for the FedAvg algorithm. It was also validated that the AirComp-assisted FedZO algorithm could attain a comparable performance with that of the noise-free case under certain SNR conditions.</p>
