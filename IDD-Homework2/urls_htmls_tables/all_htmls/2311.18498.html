<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel, data-agnostic, model poisoning attack on Federated Learning (FL), by designing a new adversarial graph autoencoder (GAE)-based framework. The attack requires no knowledge of FL training data and achieves both effectiveness and undetectability. By listening to the benign local models and the global model, the attacker extracts the graph structural correlations among the benign local models and the training data features substantiating the models. The attacker then adversarially regenerates the graph structural correlations while maximizing the FL training loss, and subsequently generates malicious local models using the adversarial graph structure and the training data features of the benign ones. A new algorithm is designed to iteratively train the malicious local models using GAE and sub-gradient descent. The convergence of FL under attack is rigorously proved, with a considerably large optimality gap. Experiments show that the FL accuracy drops gradually under the proposed attack and existing defense mechanisms fail to detect it. The attack can give rise to an infection across all benign devices, making it a serious threat to FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The use of mobile edge computing is increasingly prevalent, especially in catering to user devices that come with a multitude of sensors. These sensors produce vast amounts of data, like images recording human activities or the real-time locations of vehicles, as seen in smart city scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, transferring this training data from the user’s device to a server can pose a threat to data privacy leakage. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning approach that gains traction as a solution to mitigate data privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. With FL, user devices can jointly train a machine learning model without having to disclose their private data to a server.
The user devices, acting as clients, iteratively train their local models on their private data and send the local model updates to a server.
At the server, a global model is updated without collecting private data from the user devices. The global model is then sent back to the user devices, allowing them to continue training their local models based on the global model and their local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This process helps to support data privacy and allows for real-time processing capabilities at the edge of networks, making FL a significant aspect of mobile edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the fact that FL can help prevent attackers from accessing the private data of user devices, an attacker (in most cases, a malicious user device) can potentially launch model poisoning or data poisoning attacks to manipulate FL and propagate the attacks into benign user devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, resulting in a failure of FL training. Specifically, model poisoning aims to send malicious local model updates to the server during an aggregation process. The malicious update can introduce specific vulnerabilities in the global model or simply degrade FL performance. By contrast, data poisoning attempts to inject malicious data or modify existing data on user devices to misguide local model training, thus compromising local model updates. Existing data poisoning attacks generally require an attacker to have some knowledge of the datasets used for FL training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, so that it can extract and manipulate the features of the datasets for effective attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. By launching model poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, an attacker could manipulate either the hyperparameters of the local models or the training datasets of benign users to compromise learning accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Much less constrained and potentially more threatening model poisoning attacks on FL would result if they could be based solely on the benign local models overheard by an attacker and the global models broadcast by the aggregator; i.e., when the attacker has no access to the training data. However, without training data, it is challenging for the malicious local models to strike a balance between effectiveness and undetectability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, such attacks are new and have not been reported in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new, data-agnostic, model poisoning attack on FL systems, where an adversarial graph autoencoder (GAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is designed to generate malicious local models solely based on the benign local models overheard and capturing the correlation features of the benign local and global models. Specifically, an attacker overhears the benign local models uploaded by the user devices, and the global model broadcast by the server. It extracts the graph structure capturing the correlations between the benign local models, and decouples the graph structure from underlying data features substantiating the local models.
The attacker first regenerates manipulatively the graph structure to retain the structural features of the local models and maximize the FL training loss by using the GAE, and then generates malicious local models by applying the regenerated graph structure to the data features of the benign local models. As a result, the malicious local models can effectively compromise the global model, while remaining compatible with the benign models and hence reasonably undetectable.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed GAE-based attack on FL involves attackers intentionally poisoning malicious local models, aiming to degrade or manipulate the performance of the global model. The attack challenges the security, privacy, and robustness of FL. While security is threatened by unauthorized access or malicious insiders tampering with local models, privacy concerns arise when the attackers try to reverse-engineer or glean information about the benign devices’ data. Moreover, robustness, which is the ability of FL to consistently produce reliable and accurate results, can be directly undermined, as poisoned local models compromise the integrity and efficacy of FL. To this end, the proposed GAE-based attack poses a comprehensive threat to the security, privacy, and robustness of FL.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section reviews the literature on adversarial attacks against wireless systems as well as FL, including model and data poisoning attacks.
On the one hand, because of their broadcast nature, wireless channels are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. An attacker is likely to overhear the local model updates transmitted by the other benign users in wireless FL. On the other hand, the model poisoning attack considered in this paper has not been studied in the literature. Instead, existing attacks on wireless FL have focused primarily on building an adversarial data classification/label model for attackers, according to the data packets and features overheard, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

Smart meter data could inform residents of which appliances consumed the most electricity and adjust energy production. The attacker employed deep learning to train a power usage pattern classification model and generated malicious data that was indistinguishable from the true data.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, machine learning was used to generate an adversarial attack for targeting data fusion or aggregation.

They also evaluated non-targeted adversarial attacks against convolutional NN-based device identification. To evaluate these attacks, the authors used combined indicators of logits to increase the perturbation levels and iterative steps, resulting in a high success rate of adversarial attacks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, researchers used deep learning to recognize COVID-19 symptoms by training on medical data from user devices.

The attack began by building a shadow graph based on overheard data packets and features. A random walk algorithm was then used to evaluate each node in the attacker’s graph, selecting the node with the largest weight to attack. The attack would perturb data features and alter classification labels. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, an adversarial attack was developed to utilize graph embedding and augmentation to misclassify system malware samples as benign.

The malicious server discriminated the devices’ identities and data representatives to supervise the training of GANs and generate malicious data for each specific device. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors focused on a device-level privacy leakage attack launched by a malicious server. A GAN-based framework was presented to discriminate the data category and device’s identity and recover the private data of the device.
The attack could associate the data features from different devices to re-identify the local models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a new data-agnostic model poisoning attack, where malicious local models are generated solely based on the benign local models overheard and the correlation features of the benign local and global models. This attack could be particularly severe in FL systems under wireless settings, due to the broadcast nature of radio. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-B Threat Model ‣ III System Model ‣ Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph Autoencoder Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, an attacker within the vicinity of benign user devices and equipped with radio transceivers can passively eavesdrop on the transmitted local models of some (if not all) of the benign user devices, extracting their features and generating its own malicious local model. Although cryptography can prevent eavesdropping attacks to some extent, existing techniques, such as those developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, have demonstrated the possibility of deciphering encrypted information with limited initial data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In response to the prevalent threat of model poisoning in FL, an attacker detection model residing on the server can be applied, which leverages the Euclidean distance metric to discern malicious local models, for instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. By measuring the straight-line distance between each incoming local model and the aggregated global model, this model aims to identify anomalous deviations indicative of malicious intent. The underlying rationale is that genuine local models from benign devices are expected to cluster within a certain proximity in the model space, while malicious local models, designed to sabotage the global model’s integrity, would exhibit more pronounced deviations. By setting a distance threshold, local models that exceed this threshold can be flagged or discarded, effectively isolating and mitigating the impact of malicious local models on the global model’s integrity. This server-side defense mechanism underscores the potential of geometric measures, like Euclidean distance, as powerful tools in safeguarding FL systems from adversarial attacks.</p>

Specifically, we propose to decompose the local model parameters of the benign devices into a graph capturing the correlations (or similarity) between the benign local models, and the underlying spectral-domain data features that the local models capture. Then, we regenerate the graph with the GAE in a manipulative manner and subsequently compose malicious local models with the regenerated graph and the original, genuine data features. The rationale of this design is provided as follows.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the implementation of the proposed GAE-based, data-agnostic, model poisoning attack in PyTorch. We evaluate the testing accuracy of the local and global models of FL under attack, using the MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, fashionMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, and CIFAR-10 datasets.
We also report the detection rate of the attack, where the detection is based on the Euclidean distances of the malicious local models and the benign local models to the global models, as typically done in the latest literature, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we compare the proposed attack with the existent data-agnostic model poisoning (MP) attack that produces malicious local models by mimicking other benign devices’ training samples to degrade the learning accuracy. As discussed earlier in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Proposed Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning Attack on FL ‣ Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph Autoencoder Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, our GAE-based attack represents a novel type of attack, which only depends on the benign local models overheard and the global models, has no access to any of the training data, and attempts to compromise FL training processes.
Few existing techniques can produce malicious models in such a way, i.e., based solely on the overheard benign models, as most existing techniques would require the knowledge of (part of) the dataset used in the FL training processes, e.g., for a different purpose, such as inserting a backdoor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> or injecting malicious traffic into the benign training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. The MP attack mechanism considered for comparisons with our proposed new attack has been implemented in several existing studies, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, in which the attacker manipulates the training process by injecting a fake device and sending fake local models to the server.</p>

We note that, regardless of the specific model architecture (NNs or SVMs) employed for model training at benign user devices, the fundamental premise of the data-agnostic, model poisoning attack remains valid. Specifically, it involves the creation of malicious local models, which, when aggregated, compromise the global model by increasing the FL training loss. It also involves a new adversarial GAE crafted to generate these malicious local models based on the benign local models overheard, and captures the correlation features intrinsic to the benign local models and the global model, where the benign local models can be either NN or SVM models.</p>

We compare the proposed attack with a model poisoning (MP) attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, in which the attacker manipulates the training process by injecting a fake device and sending fake local models to the server.
Since the MP attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> shares the same objective as our proposed data-agnostic model poisoning approach, i.e., reducing the accuracy of FL, a comparison with this reference showcases the efficacy of our proposed method in the context of prevailing model poisoning attacks.
For comparison purposes, Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph Autoencoder Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> plots the accuracy of the benign local models without any attacks.

The performance of devices 1 and 2 drops from 75% to 55% and from 92% to 59%, respectively. The accuracy of the model drops from 91% to 80% when exposed to the MP attack in which the performance of the five devices follows a similar pattern. This is because the new GAE-based attack reconstructs the adversarial adjacency matrix according to the individual features of the user devices. As a result, the attacker falsifies the local models to maximize the FL loss; see (<a href="#S4.E9" title="In IV-A GAE Model for Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning ‣ IV Proposed Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning Attack on FL ‣ Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph Autoencoder Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>).</p>

In contrast, the accuracy of all five devices under the MP attack is above 50%, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph Autoencoder Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(f).
Furthermore, it can be observed that the accuracy with the CIFAR-10 dataset is generally lower than the performance with the MNIST and fashionMNIST datasets. This is because the CIFAR-10 dataset contains a more diverse set of images, which makes it more challenging to differentiate and label, leading to lower overall accuracy.</p>

One way to detect these malicious attacks is to compare the distances (or differences) between the local models and the global model. A larger distance can be considered as an indication of a malicious local model, and the server can detect it accordingly. Both the Euclidean distance and cosine distance are commonly used metrics to assess the similarities between two vectors. Particularly, the Euclidean distance can assess the conformity between two vectors by capturing both the magnitude and direction of two local models. For this reason, the Euclidean distance is considered in this paper, which is consistent with many recent studies, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

It can be observed that, in general, the local models with the MNIST dataset have the smallest distance compared to the other two datasets. This is expected as the handwritten digits in MNIST are relatively simple to recognize or falsify.</p>

This makes it difficult for the aggregator to identify the attacker and defend against the attack.
In contrast, the MP attack results in a significantly larger Euclidean distance between the malicious local model and the global model, making it easier to detect.
This highlights the key advantage of the proposed GAE-based attack, which is designed to generate malicious local models based on the feature correlation between the benign local and global models, making the differences between the malicious local model and the benign local models indistinguishable.</p>

In general, the average accuracy of the local models falls with the growth of the eavesdropped benign user devices. The reason is that overhearing a greater number of benign local models results in capturing more correlation features of the models, leading to the generation of a malicious model for more effective poisoning.

A striking observation is that the malicious local model (from device 1) constructed via the VAE-based attack possesses a significantly larger Euclidean distance than the benign local models. This suggests that detecting the VAE-based attacks on the server side is feasible by assessing the Euclidean distance. The underlying reason is that the VAEs are general autoencoders and can handle high-dimensional and continuous data, such as images and audio. They do not capture graph structures inside data, as opposed to GAEs.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have investigated a new, data-agnostic, model poisoning attack to FL, where the proposed adversarial GAE gives rise to an infection of benign user devices and the FL training accuracy gradually drops. The adversarial GAE allows the attacker to extract the common underlying data features of the benign local models as well as their correlations to generate the malicious model with which the FL training loss is maximized. Since the malicious and benign local models are indistinguishable, it is difficult to identify the GAE-based attack at the server. We implemented the GAE-based attack against the FL on SVM models using PyTorch. Performances were evaluated based on the MNIST, fashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>
