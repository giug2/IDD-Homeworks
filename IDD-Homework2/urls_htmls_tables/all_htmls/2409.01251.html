<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Split Federated Learning (SFL) splits and collaboratively trains a shared model between clients and server, where clients transmit activations and client-side models to server for updates. Recent SFL studies assume synchronous transmission of activations and client-side models from clients to server. However, due to significant variations in computational and communication capabilities among clients, activations and client-side models arrive at server asynchronously. The delay caused by asynchrony significantly degrades the performance of SFL.
To address this issue, we consider an asynchronous SFL framework, where an activation buffer and a model buffer are embedded on the server to manage the asynchronously transmitted activations and client-side models, respectively. Furthermore, as asynchronous activation transmissions cause the buffer to frequently receive activations from resource-rich clients, leading to biased updates of the server-side model, we propose Generative activations-aided Asynchronous SFL (GAS). In GAS, the server maintains an activation distribution for each label based on received activations and generates activations from these distributions according to the degree of bias. These generative activations are then used to assist in updating the server-side model, ensuring more accurate updates. We derive a tighter convergence bound, and our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Split Federated Learning (SFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jeon and Kim <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Thapa et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> emerges as a promising solution for efficient resource-constrained distributed learning by combining the benefits of both Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Singh et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> and Split Learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gupta and Raskar <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Specifically, in SFL, the model is split into two parts: the initial layers are processed in parallel by the participating clients, and the intermediate activations are sent to the server, which completes the remaining layers. The server then sends the backpropagated gradients back to the clients, who use these gradients to update their client-side models. After several iterations, the server aggregates the client-side models to form the globally updated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional SFL always assumes synchronous model exchange, where the server waits to receive all client-side models for aggregation. However, since clients have different communication and computational capabilities, client-side models are uploaded at the server asynchronously. The slow clients are referred to as stragglers, delaying the overall training process.
Previous works in FL such as FedAsync <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xie, Koyejo, and Gupta <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and FedBuff <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nguyen et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> are proposed to tackle the stragglers issue by allowing clients to update the global model asynchronously. Additionally, CA<sup id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> addresses convergence degradation by caching and reusing previous updates for global calibration, ensuring more consistent model updates despite asynchronous conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the existing works on stragglers issue in SFL still have limitations. On one hand, the adaptive model splitting methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yan et al. <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Shen et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> for addressing this issue in SFL are constrained by the model structure. Specifically, these methods attempt to balance the arrival time of activations by selecting appropriate split layers of the model.
Nevertheless, when the sizes of activations output by different model layers are similar or the computational and communication capabilities of clients are highly different, it is impossible to ensure simultaneous arrival of activations, regardless of the chosen split layers.
On the other hand, the stragglers issue is more serious in SFL. Specifically, recent SFL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Huang, Tian, and Tang <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Yang and Liu <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> assume synchronous activation transmissions with heterogeneous client data, where the uploaded activations are concatenated to update the server-side model centrally, reducing the bias in the deep layers of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Luo et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
However, these methods require the server to wait for stragglers to send their activations at the end of each local iteration, and the frequent transmissions of activations exacerbate the stragglers issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above issues, we propose the asynchronous learning framework for SFL, where an activation buffer and a model buffer are embedded on the server to handle asynchronous updates. Specifically, the activation buffer stores the activations uploaded asynchronously. When the buffer is full, the server concatenates these activations and uses them to update the server-side model. Similarly, the model buffer stores the client-side models uploaded asynchronously. When the buffer is full, the server aggregates the stored client-side models. By introducing the two buffers, we ensure efficient model updates and reduce delays caused by stragglers. However, due to the heterogeneous communication and computational capabilities of clients, the activation buffer may frequently receive activations from resource-rich clients, leading to biased updates in the server-side model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Leconte et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>. To solve this issue, we propose Generative activation-aided Asynchronous SFL (GAS). Specifically, the server maintains a distribution of activations for each label, dynamically updated based on the uploaded activations. When updating the server-side model, we generate the activations from the distributions according to the degree of bias. Then these generative activations are concatenated with the stored activations to update the server-side model, thereby mitigating the model update bias introduced by stragglers.
We summarize our contributions in this paper as follows:</p>

After finishing local iterations, clients send the updated client-side models to the server; ⑥ The server stores these models in the model buffer and, when full, aggregates them to complete a global iteration.

Since the server-side model and the client-side model are updated independently, where the parameters of one model remain fixed while the other is updated, we separately analyze the convergence rates of the server-side model and the client-side model.

We first compare our method with baseline asynchronous FL algorithms. Each experiment is run with three random seeds, and the average accuracy and standard deviation are reported in Table <a href="#Sx5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Performance Evaluation ‣ Experiments ‣ GAS: Generative Activation-Aided Asynchronous Split Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods, particularly under conditions of extreme data heterogeneity. This improvement in model accuracy can be attributed to two key factors. First, the proposed method allows for centralized updates of the server-side model, significantly mitigating the issue of deep model drift caused by data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Luo et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Second, by introducing generative activations, the proposed method alleviates the server-side model update bias introduced by stragglers, further enhancing model performance.
Additionally, we compare our method with baseline synchronous SFL algorithms in a real-world communication environment, with results shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Performance Evaluation ‣ Experiments ‣ GAS: Generative Activation-Aided Asynchronous Split Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits better convergence performance compared to baseline methods. This improvement is due to the asynchronous transmissions of activations and client-side models, which substantially reduce training time and achieves faster convergence speeds.</p>

As shown in Table <a href="#Sx5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Performance Evaluation ‣ Experiments ‣ GAS: Generative Activation-Aided Asynchronous Split Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the accuracy of GAS increases with the number of local iterations initially but decreases thereafter. This indicates that the number of local iterations must be carefully chosen to balance model accuracy and communication load. On one hand, a higher number of local iterations is necessary for sufficient local training. On the other hand, setting the number of local iterations too high can lead to local optima and increased communication load. Additionally, we observe that the accuracy of the baseline methods increase with the number of local iterations. This suggests that the baseline methods do not achieve sufficient training within the given local iteration settings.

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed GAS (Generative activation-aided Asynchronous SFL), a distributed asynchronous learning framework designed to address the stragglers issue in SFL. By employing an activation buffer and a model buffer, along with generative activation-aided updates, GAS effectively mitigated the impact of stragglers and improved model convergence. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrated that GAS achieved higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to baseline FL and SFL methods.</p>

Therefore, the split layer should be carefully chosen. On one hand, selecting shallower split layers can leverage the performance benefits of centralized updates. On the other hand, it is essential to avoid split layers with large output dimensions to mitigate the complexity of activation distribution estimation and its adverse effects on model performance.</p>

<div id="A1.SSx8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.SSx8.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In all SL and SFL methods, including the proposed GAS, there exists a risk of privacy leakage due to the exchange of intermediate activations between clients and the server. Specifically, these activations may contain sensitive information about the original data and an attacker can leverage the Model Inversion (MI) attack to repeatedly access and analyze the activations, gradually reconstructing the original data during the training phase. To address this issue, our proposed GAS can integrate with existing privacy-preserving mechanisms of SFL, such as NoPeek <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vepakomma et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and ResSFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which implement attacker-aware training to counteract MI attacks.
Specifically, we introduce an inversion score regularization term as</p>
