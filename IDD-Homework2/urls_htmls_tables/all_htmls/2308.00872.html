<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation is a powerful tool for privacy protection when considering public release of record-level data files. Initially proposed about three decades ago, it has generated significant research and application interest. To meet the pressing demand of data privacy protection in a variety of contexts, the field needs more researchers and practitioners. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to synthetic data, including technical details of their generation and evaluation. Our review also addresses the challenges and limitations of synthetic data, discusses practical applications, and provides thoughts for future work.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation is an unreal reality. As the phrase suggests, the data are not real but is a popular method for protecting confidential data.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We distinguish two types of data: original data (uncleaned data) and confidential data (cleaned data) containing sensitive information.</span></span></span> For instance, in the summer of 2023, America’s Datahub Consortium announced many requests for solutions and several involved generating synthetic data for privacy protections.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>“Opportunities,” Accessed on July 15, 2023. https://www.americasdatahub.org/opportunities/</span></span></span> One such request for solution<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>“Creation of Synthetic Data for the Survey of Earned Doctorates and Development and Use of Verification Metrics,” Request for Solicitation from the National Science Foundation National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.</span></span></span> states that “the anonymity of the original dataset is not compromised since synthetic records do not correspond with real ones.” This is the appeal of synthetic data for privacy protection. It lies in the concept of generating pseudo or fake records that maintain statistical representation of the confidential data. In other words, data users gain access to data that have similar structure and features as the confidential data without accessing sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Published synthetic data are one of two ways data users access confidential data. The first approach is direct access, but such access is challenging to obtain due to limited availability for external users, strict eligibility requirements, and background checks. For example, to gain access to some federal data in the United States, a data user must be a U.S. citizen, submit a research proposal, complete an extensive background check, and use a secure enclave or environment to analyze the confidential data. The second approach involves using publicly released record-level data (e.g., synthetic data) and statistics (e.g., summary tables), which are more accessible through online repositories or web-based interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the synthetic data method has existed for over thirty years, the increase in computational power and methodological advancement to generate synthetic data and the rise of disclosure threats makes synthetic data very appealing.

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With synthetic data generation surging in popularity within both research and practical applications, an increasing number of government and private entities are turning to this approach as a means to protect confidential information. However, newcomers to the field may encounter a daunting amount of information, where some challenges and limitations of synthetic data not readily disclosed. This review will address these concerns by offering readers a comprehensive introduction to synthetic data for privacy protection. We provide an overview of the synthetic data along with the technical details of how to generate and evaluate synthetic data for privacy protection.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Overview of synthetic data</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide a concise overview of synthetic data. Additionally, we review and discuss important aspects of synthetic data, including the technical details of their generation and evaluation as well as use cases in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Technical details of generating and evaluating synthetic data ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Applications and Use Cases ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The synthetic data approach to privacy protection largely originated from multiple imputation for missing data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rubin,, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>. In missing data problems, Bayesian models can be designed and estimated on the available data according to different missing mechanisms. Some examples include missing completely at random, MCAR; missing at random, MAR; and missing not at random, MNAR. Researchers and practitioners can impute the missing values from the posterior distributions estimated from these Bayesian models. Multiple imputed datasets are created to account for the uncertainty from model estimation and data generation. In contrast, for data protection problems, privacy experts and researchers can design and estimate the Bayesian models on the confidential data and then they generate the synthetic values from the posterior distributions estimated from the Bayesian models. Variables of observations that require privacy protection can then be replaced with synthetic values instead of their confidential variables in the public release.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to multiple imputation for missing data problems, privacy experts and researchers create multiple synthetic datasets to account for the uncertainty in the model estimation and data generation process. Different combining rules for obtaining valid inferences from multiple synthetic datasets need to be used, which we will review in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Evaluation of data utility ‣ 3 Technical details of generating and evaluating synthetic data ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a> in detail. Moreover, synthesis models for synthetic data generation do not need to be Bayesian as we will discuss in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Synthetic data generation ‣ 3 Technical details of generating and evaluating synthetic data ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. It is worth mentioning that the majority of the synthetic data literature deals with confidential data free of missing values. A few works, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kim et al., (<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Jiang et al., (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Yu et al., (<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, propose different approaches to simultaneously dealing with missing data imputation and synthetic data generation. Finally, the choice of the number of synthetic datasets to generate should be made specific to the application. Common choices include three, five, ten, and twenty synthetic datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the beginning, two flavors of synthetic data exist: partially synthetic data and fully synthetic data. The main distinction between the two can be thought of as whether or not we need to protect all variables of all observations in the confidential dataset. If not, the data curator can choose the partially synthetic data approach, otherwise, the fully synthetic data approach. In both cases, multiple synthetic datasets should be generated to account for variability in the model estimation and data generation process. Different combining rules are required for partially and fully synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For partially synthetic data, a synthetic dataset contains the same set of observations as in the confidential dataset, i.e., the two datasets have the same number of observations and there exists a one-to-one correspondence between observations in the two datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Little,, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. The data curator replaces the sensitive variables with synthetic values either for all observations or for only a subset of observations, depending on the protection goals of the data curator. The remaining variables are left unchanged, or un-synthesized.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Generating fully synthetic data can be thought of as all variables of all observations in the confidential dataset being replaced with synthetic values. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Rubin, (<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> originally proposes that the generation process of fully synthetic data consists of two steps. The data curator first creates a fully synthetic population from the confidential dataset (treated as a sample), where all variables contain values generated from the synthesis model that is built and estimated on the confidential dataset. Second, the data curator takes a sample from the generated synthetic population to be released as a fully synthetic dataset. In this approach, the resulting fully synthetic dataset could have more or less observations compared to the confidential dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, a fully synthetic dataset is often regarded as synthesizing all variables in the confidential dataset. The generation process would be similar to how a partially synthetic dataset is created, except that all the variables are synthesized from the synthesis model, whereas in a partially synthetic dataset, not all variables would be synthesized. We highlight the distinction early on given many misunderstandings of fully synthetic data in research and in practice. Moreover, as we will present and discuss in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Evaluation of data utility ‣ 3 Technical details of generating and evaluating synthetic data ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a> for utility evaluation of synthetic data, different combining rules have been developed and are needed for obtaining valid inference for partially synthetic data and for fully synthetic data. If a fully synthetic dataset is generated using the partial synthesis approach (i.e., no synthetic population is generated), then combining rules for obtaining valid inference for partially synthetic data should be applied.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Overview of synthetic data ‣ Advancing Microdata Privacy Protection: A Review of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the synthetic data approach mostly stemmed from multiple imputation for missing data problems. Although not all synthesis models need to be Bayesian, Bayesian models have played a large role in developing synthesis models since the beginning. In light of this, we focus on reviewing Bayesian synthesis models versus non-Bayesian synthesis models for synthetic data generation. There are other ways to categorize synthesis models. For example, parametric versus non-parametric.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Without loss of generality and due to popularity in practice and research, we focus on describing synthesis models for the purpose of generating partially synthetic data and fully synthetic data using the partial synthesis approach. Privacy experts and researchers create and estimate synthesis models using the confidential dataset. The partially synthetic datasets generated from these models contain the same observations in the confidential dataset. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between records in the confidential dataset and in each synthetic dataset. On the other hand, the fully synthetic datasets generated from the partial synthesis approach are typically considered containing records that do not correspond to the same observations in the confidential dataset. In this case, the partial synthesis approach simply replaces all variables with synthetic values. More details about generating fully synthetic data according to the original proposal in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Rubin, (<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Raghunathan et al., (<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>); Reiter and Raghunathan, (<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>); Drechsler, (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Synthesizing geographical information using Bayesian spatial models has been another well-studied topic in recent literature. This line of work focuses on utilizing features of areal level spatial models, also known as disease mapping models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Clayton and Kaldor,, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>. It relies on dividing the area of interest into a grid consisting of multiple cells and creating multiple distinct attribute patterns through cross-tabulation of observations’ non-spatial (and typically categorical) attributes. We can use Poisson regression models to estimate the number of observations in a given cell with a given attribute pattern. After MCMC estimation, we then make posterior predictions the numbers of observations, and synthetic geographical information, such as individual locations, can be generated according to the normalized probability vectors of the given attribute pattern within the grid cell.</p>

One straightforward parametric method for generating synthetic data is selecting an appropriate probability distribution. This approach involves making random draws from the chosen distribution based on the parameters or sufficient statistics from the confidential data. For instance, if the confidential data follows a Gaussian distribution, we can generate the synthetic data by drawing random samples from a normal distribution, utilizing the mean and variance obtained from the confidential data.</p>

The latter approach captures more of the multivariate relationships (or joint distributions) without being too computationally expensive, as compared to estimating a complicated joint distribution of all predictors to be synthesized. We can select the synthesis order based on the priority of the variables or the relationships between them. Typically, the earlier in the order a variable is synthesized, the better the confidential information is preserved in the synthetic data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Bowen et al., (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposes a method that ranks variable importance by either practical or statistical utility and sequentially synthesizes the data accordingly.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most common ways to evaluate the synthetic data is assessing the univariate and multivariate distributional similarities between the confidential data and the synthetic data. Privacy experts and researchers refer to these measures as global utility (also known as general utility).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the univarate case, we could calculate the frequencies and relative frequencies of the categorical variables in the synthetic and confidential data. When the variables are numeric, we could compute the means, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis, percentiles, and number of zero/non-zero values. We can also visually compare the the results of the univariate distributions from the synthetic and confidential data using a histogram, density plots, or empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) plots. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Woo et al., (<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> proposes the use of the eCDF as a global utility metric, which is particularly useful for univariate numeric variables. While the metric can be easily extended to multivariate distributions, implementing the eCDF estimation itself in multivariate cases is not straightforward. Therefore, the eCDF global utility metric is rarely used beyond univariate cases.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The eCDF approach that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Woo et al., (<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> proposes belongs to a group of methods called discriminant based methods that measure how well a predictive model can distinguish or discriminate between the records from the confidential and synthetic data, assessing the relationships among multiple variables. In other words, these methods combine the synthetic and confidential datasets and see how well a predictive model can discriminate between synthetic observations and confidential observations in the combined dataset. The inability to distinguish between the records suggests a high utility synthesis, because the synthetic observations closely resemble the confidential observations. Any predictive model can be used, such as logistic regression and CART.</p>

Essentially, pMSE normalizes the MSE statistic by its expected null value and standard deviation, helping with its interpretability and differentiating the synthetic dataset apart from the confidential dataset. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Snoke et al., (<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> also develops the pMSE ratio, which is one of the most popular discriminant based methods. The pMSE ratio is the average pMSE score across all records, divided by the null model, where the null model is the the expected value of the pMSE score under the best case scenario when the model used to generate the data reflects the confidential data perfectly. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sakshaug and Raghunathan, (<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> discretizes the propensity scores based on how the Chi-squared test is formulated. Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Bowen et al., (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> calculates the eCDFs of the propensity scores of the synthetic and confidential data and then computes the the KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) distance, a method called SPECKS. In other words, the SPECKS method considers the worst-case separation between the synthetic dataset and the confidential dataset.</p>

The authors find that the utility metric algorithms produce mixed results in ranking the best performing differentially private synthetic data method.

ROE is the ratio of the confidential and synthetic data estimates such that the smaller of the two estimates is divided by the larger one. If the ROE value is 1, then the confidential and synthetic estimates are the same. For univariate estimands, such as regression coefficients and means, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Karr et al., (<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> creates the confidence interval overlap (CIO).

This work highlights how global utility metrics can be too broad and miss aspects of the synthetic dataset that do not align with the confidential dataset. On the other hand, analysis-specific metrics may perform well for the selected analyses on the synthetic data but not for others. This is why it is critical to determine the proper analysis, but it is difficult to anticipate all downstream data uses.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data should be considered for public release based on the amount of disclosure risks they carry in addition to the level of utility preservation. In other words, synthetic data with a high level of utility and also a high level of disclosure risks might not be an ideal candidate for public release. It is therefore paramount to define disclosure risks, and, subsequently, design metrics and develop evaluation methods that are relatively easy to implement computationally. Data curators should evaluate and compare the disclosure risks of the confidential data and of the synthetic data. This process demonstrates the amount of reduction of disclosure risks the synthetic data can offer and can serve as a criterion for public release. As such, disclosure risks can be defined and evaluated on the microdata, including the confidential and the synthetic.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We focus on two types of disclosure risks that are commonly considered for synthetic data research and applications. The first type is called identity disclosure, which is sometimes known as identification disclosure or re-identification disclosure. Identity disclosure risk considers the scenario where a malicious intruder attempts to identify record(s) of interest in the confidential data. The second type is called attribute disclosure, which refers to the scenario where an intruder seeks to infer the confidential values of variable(s) of interest for targeted record(s).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In both cases, the data intruder would use available information or knowledge from other sources, combined with the published microdata (the confidential or the synthetic, depending on which are being evaluated) to figure out the identity or the confidential value(s) of the targeted record(s). Often times, an identity disclosure could lead to an attribute disclosure, whereas an attribute disclosure can happen without an identify disclosure in the first place. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu, (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> provides a review of Bayesian estimation of these two types of disclosure risks for synthetic data.

Identity disclosure is only considered for partially synthetic data, because the synthetic records correspond to the same set of records in the confidential data, resulting in a one-to-one mapping between the datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hu,, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.

In this framework, we assume an intruder will attempt to identify a target record in the confidential dataset with available information from other sources. Within this subset of variables, some variables might be synthesized in the synthetic dataset. This means those values will be different from those in the confidential dataset, while others stay un-synthesized. Even for the un-synthesized values, the intruder’s information about the target record might not be accurate. Considering the intruder’s behavior becomes vitally important, such as what information they have access to and how they would use it to identify the target record. We can easily see this framework assumes the knowledge and behavior of the data intruder when attempting identification of target record(s). As a result, identity disclosure risk results of the same synthetic data can vary depending on what assumptions are made.</p>

Recall that an identity disclosure could lead to an attribute disclosure, but an attribute disclosure can happen without an identity disclosure. Therefore, privacy researchers considers attribute disclosure for both partially synthetic and fully synthetic data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The majority of the literature focuses on the evaluation of the attribute disclosure risk without a prior identity disclosure for partially synthetic data. One main line of work uses statistical models based on available variable(s) to predict the value(s) of other variable(s) to infer the attribute(s) of interest. We will call the available variable(s) used in this process as the key variables, while the other variable(s) of attribute interest as the target variable(s). The main difference between different approaches in this area of work is what types of statistical models are used in the prediction task. Without loss of generality, we next describe the approaches for predicting one categorical target variable with categorical key variables. The extension to continuous key variables could be achieved through a similar approach, starting from exact matching and moving to a radius-based matching, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hornby and Hu, 2021a </a></cite> for identity disclosure risk evaluation.</p>

Among these matched synthetic records, we next calculate percentage of synthetic records who share the same value of the target variable as the confidential record. The resulting percentage can be thought of a probability of attribute disclosure, which is called the individual correct attribution probability (CAP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Elliot,, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Taub et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Baillargeon and Charest,, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. We can perform the evaluation process for each confidential record of interest and take the sum and the average as the file-level CAP summaries. While easy to implement in most settings, the empirical distribution based CAP statistics are not leveraging more advanced statistical modeling techniques, which can potentially help the intruder for better predictions. Consequently, the CAP statistics might be overly conservative and underestimate the attribute disclosure risks given their simple prediction process.</p>

One line of work considers the worst case scenario, where the intruder knows about every other record in the confidential dataset except for the record of interest, and then attempts to infer the confidential values of its synthesized variables <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reiter et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Hu et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. We can consider such a worst-case-scenario approach providing the most conservative evaluation of the attribute disclosure risk. In other words, any less information about the rest of the confidential dataset, the evaluation would result in a lower level of attribute disclosure risk. However, this worst-case-scenario approach has limitations to its sophisticated implementation procedure, especially when less information is assumed to be known, making it less computationally feasible. Typically, this approach requires either re-estimation of the posterior distribution without the last and unavailable record of interest or some approximation solution that avoids rounds of re-estimation.

Once the R-U (risk-utility) confidential map concept is proposed, privacy experts and data curators have since picked it up in the synthetic data literature. We can use a R-U confidential map to determine which one (or several ones) exhibit the most optimal risk-utility trade-off when it comes to determining the public release.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, if we are tasked with protecting a given confidential dataset, we can propose a few synthetic data generation methods and perform utility and disclosure risk evaluation. We can then pick the one with the most optimal balance for public release. Some research attempt to tune the risk-utility trade-off directly in the synthesis model. This approach eliminates the need to develop one or more brand new synthesis models when the existing synthesis model produces synthetic data with high utility but also high disclosure risks. We can instead tune this existing synthesis model to a version that produces synthetic data with a lower level of disclosure risk at the price of a reduced level of utility.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu and Hoshino, (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> uses the Quasi-Multinomial distribution, which includes an additional parameter compared to the multinomial distribution. This parameter can effectively tune the risk-utility trade-off of the resulting synthetic multivariate categorical data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Jiang et al., (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> incorporates a tuning parameter in their mask component that can balance the amount of utility preservation and disclosure risk of the resulting synthetic data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jackson et al., 2022b </a></cite> also integrates tuning parameters in their saturated models to generate categorical synthetic data that can balance between utility and disclosure risks. Extensions to their work can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">Jackson et al., 2022a </a></cite>. Another example is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hu et al., 2022b </a></cite>, where a record-index risk probability (between 0 and 1) is calculated based on the confidential data. This probability is then subsequently used in the likelihood expression through the exponents, such that high-risk records will be downweighted in posterior estimation. This results in the records receiving a higher level of protection in the resulting synthetic data. Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Schneider et al., (<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposes a Bayesian generalized linear model synthesis model with a shrinkage prior that allows the tuning of risk-utility trade-off for user-generated content data. The CART synthesis models are also investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Schneider et al., (<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, where the complexity parameter of the CART models is experimented to tune risk-utility trade-off of the resulting synthetic data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our first example is a partially synthetic data application for a sample of Airbnb listings in New York City with Bayesian models. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Guo and Hu, (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> investigates the use of synthetic data to protect two sensitive variables in the sample. The first variable is the number of available days of an Airbnb listing, a count variable which has a large amount of zero-valued records. This variable is also truncated at the two ends at 0 and 365. The other variable is the price, which is numeric. Bayesian models are selected for a sequential synthesis of these two sensitive variables, with a zero-inflated truncated Poisson regression model for the number of available days first and a linear regression model for price next. Predictors including neighborhood (categorical), room type (categorical), and review count (count) are used in both models. MCMC estimation software JAGS is used in model estimation. The authors then use several utility metrics. For global utility, they use pMSE, eCDF, and another cluster analysis based metric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Woo et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>, whereas for analysis-specific utility, they evaluate the mean, extreme quantiles, and several regression coefficients with CIOs.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our next example involves generating a fully synthetic dataset for U.S. taxpayer data using sequential CART. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">Bowen et al., 2022b </a></cite> develops a methodology to synthesize a 207-variable dataset, which contains both categorical and continuous variables that are considered sensitive. At a high level, they first synthesize the categorical variables before applying a sequential CART model to synthesize the continuous variables. They also apply several mid-synthesis constraints, such as net capital losses may only take the values of $0 to -$3,000, for values that fall outside the bounds of the data. Some noise is added to the final nodes of the fitted CART model if the nodes contain very few observations.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thirty years of synthetic data research and applications have demonstrated huge potential of the synthetic data approach for privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Drechsler and Haensch,, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Reiter,, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Nevertheless, as we have discussed in this article, there are still many opportunities for more researchers to take an active part. For instance, tuning risk-utility trade-off is a much under-researched area that holds promise for creating more effective and efficient synthesis. We also have not developed good synthetic data methods that handle survey weights, longitudinal, and texts well despite the great demand and abundance of such data types requiring privacy protection. Additionally, we need more computationally-feasible synthetic data approaches for spatial information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Turning to the synthetic data tools, we recognize the pressing need for open-source packages for synthetic data generation and evaluation. As valuable as some of the sophisticated synthetic data generation models and evaluation methods proposed in the literature may be, data curators typically will not adopt them unless they can access readily available open-source packages. This emphasizes the need for collaborative teams, including researchers, practitioners, and programmers, to develop and disseminate new synthetic data methods for their generation and evaluation in a user-friendly manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to tools development, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu and Bowen, (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> calls for education and training opportunities for students and workforce in synthetic data (or statistical data privacy in general), which is worth restating. There have been successes in educating and training undergraduate students in synthetic data generation and evaluation for a wide range of applications (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ros et al., (<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Cao and Hu, (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>); Guo and Hu, (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> are all undergraduate student projects) and engaging undergraduates in synthetic data tools development <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hornby and Hu, 2021a, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">Hornby and Hu, 2021b, </a>)</cite>. We strongly advocate for more courses and training for students and workforce. By doing so, the next generation of statisticians and data scientists will be equipped with the essential knowledge, skills, and tools for using synthetic data for privacy protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">High profile use cases, like the 2020 Census data products in the United States, have improved communication about synthetic data and other data privacy concepts, such as differential privacy. However, the available materials are limited compared to what is needed. For instance, while many data users can likely recommend several different types of machine learning materials (e.g., books, blogs, and videos), few have recommendations for synthetic data resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Snoke and Bowen,, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. A similar situation exists for other arguably more popular data privacy methods, such as differential privacy and differentially private synthetic data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Williams et al., (<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> surveys economists from the American Economic Association membership list who opted to receive research survey emails to assess their knowledge and attitudes regarding differential/formal privacy. One question asks if participants knew anyone within their professional circles discussed the U.S. Census Bureau’s adoption of DP/formal privacy for the 2020 Decennial Census. 68.3% report no such awareness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">These examples emphasize the need for greater involvement of statisticians and data scientists in the synthetic data and broader statistical data privacy community. As of now, most meetings and conferences tend to focus on theoretical aspects within the computer science field.
