<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a promising machine learning technique that enables multiple clients to collaboratively build a model without revealing the raw data to each other. Among various types of federated learning methods, horizontal federated learning (HFL) is the best-studied category and handles homogeneous feature spaces. However, in the case of heterogeneous feature spaces, HFL uses only common features and leaves client-specific features unutilized. In this paper, we propose a HFL method using neural networks named continual horizontal federated learning (CHFL), a continual learning approach to improve the performance of HFL by taking advantage of unique features of each client. CHFL splits the network into two columns corresponding to common features and unique features, respectively. It jointly trains the first column by using common features through vanilla HFL and locally trains the second column by using unique features and leveraging the knowledge of the first one via lateral connections without interfering with the federated training of it. We conduct experiments on various real world datasets and show that CHFL greatly outperforms vanilla HFL that only uses common features and local learning that uses all features that each client has.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing concerns for data privacy in machine learning, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has received a lot of attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning framework to enable multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. Existing FL approaches mainly focus on the scenario where each client has homogeneous data, i.e., the data with the same feature space. This setting is called <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">horizontal federated learning</span> (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, in many real world applications, the feature spaces of the data owned by different clients may not be completely the same. Their data may differ in the feature space except for some common features. Consider the following example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A hospital may share common features of patients such as age, blood pressure, etc. with nursing homes and physical examination centers. However, each medical institution also holds additional unique features such as prescription and diet information, as well. <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Applying existing HFL approaches to this setting is not efficient in terms of the performance because they can only use the common features and leaves the unique features unutilized. We need more efficient approaches to address this problem.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">There are some methods to handle heterogeneous data, i.e., to utilize all features for each client such as <span id="S1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vertical federated learning</span> (VFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and <span id="S1.p2.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated transfer learning</span> (FTL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</span> VFL assumes that each client has the same samples of data with unique feature space and jointly trains a model by fully utilizing distributed features of the overlapping samples. However, the overlapping samples are usually limited, and identifying their IDs among all clients can violate privacy problem in some cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in VFL, clients need to collaborate even during the inference phase because a VFL model takes all features as input. <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">From these perspectives, VFL connot be an efficient method to solve the problem we consider. On the other hand, FTL can handle all samples as well as all features and conduct inference locally, but most FTL methods need the overlapping samples as with VFL.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proposed a new technique, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneous federated transfer learning</span> (HFTL), which addresses the heterogeneous feature space problem with feature co-occurrence only. In HFTL, each client mutually reconstructs the missing features by using exchanged feature mapping models. Then, using all features, the clients conduct HFL to obtain a label prediction model and merge the feature mapping model and the label prediction model into a final model that can be used locally during the inference phase. <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, HFTL is applied only to a logistic regression model, and is difficult to apply to more complex models such as <span id="S1.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">neural network</span> (NN)</span> because HFTL needs to apply multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to exchanging the feature mapping model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">continual horizontal federated learning</span> (CHFL), a NN-based HFL method to relax the same feature space assumption using <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">continual learning</span> (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. To solve the problem of different input features for different clients, we divide the features into common features and unique features for each client. Then, we jointly train a common network that takes common features as input by using vanilla HFL and locally train a unique network that takes unique features as input. We utilize an effective model architecture used in a CL method, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">progressive neural network</span> (PNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, for training global and local networks, to combine each of their layer outputs and transfer the knowledge of the global network into each local network without obstructing the training of the global network. <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In CHFL, clients do not need overlapping samples and can conduct inference locally using all of their own features.</span> Through extensive experiments using five real world datasets, we show that our method outperforms two baselines: a HFL approach based on common features only and a local learning approach.</p>

On the basis of the distribution characteristics of the data, FL approaches can be categorized into three types as first introduced by Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>: horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">HFL assumes the homogeneous data scenario, which implies the feature spaces of data in different
clients are the same. If the data samples owned by different clients greatly differ, their collaborative training becomes advantageous to the machine learning model because of the increased number of the dataset samples. There are well-known HFL methods such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In FedAvg, each client locally trains a deep learning model with their local data and uploads their trained model parameters to the server. The server updates the global model by averaging the parameters of the local models and sends it to all clients. This process is one iteration and is repeated until the convergence. Since the parameters shared with the server are only the gradients, the data privacy is preserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedProx is a FL method to address the problem of lacking an independent and identically distributed (IID) data assumption across clients, i.e., non-IID data problem. It adds the proximal term to the learning objective to reduce the potential weight divergence defined by Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. To address non-IID setting, there are studies in different directions: <span id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized federated learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These approaches aim to train optimal personalized models for each client, not a single model. From this perspective, our method that utilizes unique features of each client can be considered as a kind of personalized FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">VFL is in the heterogeneous data scenario where data owned by different clients have the same sample IDs but disjoint feature spaces. In the process of VFL, each client locally computes their model intermediate outputs that will be aggregated in a privacy-preserving way at a server or certain client to obtain the loss. Then, each client downloads the updated information obtained by minimizing the loss and updates their local model. In this way, a VFL model using all features is built.

We aim to jointly train the parameters of the common column by HFL and locally train the parameters of the unique column without interfering with the training of the parameters of the common column. We can consider this issue as learning a unique task (inferring with unique features) without forgetting the knowledge of a common task (inferring with common features). Inspired by this observation, we apply the CL method, especially PNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> architecture, to this setting. <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Utilizing PNN architecture enables a common column to be built collaboratively without being affected by the unique features of each client, and an unique column to leverage the federated knowledge of the common column via lateral connections, which leads to the CHFL being able to utilize both common features and unique features. In the following, we present more specific model architecture and detailed algorithm of CHFL.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed CHFL, a continual learning approach to address the heterogeneous data problem in HFL. CHFL prepares two neural networks corresponding to common features and unique features, respectively and laterally connect them while training the common network with HFL and locally training the unique network. Through the experiments on various datasets, CHFL was shown to improve vanilla HFL method that only uses common features and outperform local learning that uses all features of the corresponding client.</p>
