<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been a promising paradigm for communicating and edge processing of data on the move. We aim to employ Federated Learning (FL) and prominent features of blockchain into MEC architecture such as connected autonomous vehicles to enable complete decentralization, immutability, and rewarding mechanisms simultaneously. FL is advantageous for mobile devices with constrained connectivity since it requires model updates to be delivered to a central point instead of substantial amounts of data communication. For instance, FL in autonomous, connected vehicles can increase data diversity and allow model customization, and predictions are possible even when the vehicles are not connected (by exploiting their local models) for short times. However, existing synchronous FL and Blockchain incur extremely high communication costs due to mobility-induced impairments and do not apply directly to MEC networks. We propose a fully asynchronous Blockchained Federated Learning (BFL) framework referred to as BFL-MEC, in which the mobile clients and their models evolve independently yet guarantee stability in the global learning process. More importantly, we employ <span id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-quantum secure</span> features over BFL-MEC to verify the client’s identity and defend against malicious attacks. All of our design assumptions and results are evaluated with extensive simulations.</p>

</div>
<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
promising approach to tackle the limitations of traditional centralized machine learning (ML) methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,
which are unable to handle the challenges posed by big data and complex models.
By keeping the raw data on the end devices,
also known as <span id="p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
FL ensures data privacy and ownership.
The system uses a centralized global server to aggregate updates from clients,
and iteratively distributes the new global models back to the clients.
However, the traditional FL setup based on a centralized server has several drawbacks,
including <em id="p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">single point of failure</em> and instability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore,
FL is vulnerable to attacks by malicious or compromised clients,
who can modify local gradients and launch inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
These attacks can lead to model poisoning,
which undermines the integrity and reliability of the whole system.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p2.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain and FL are two distributed technologies
that can complement each other to create a secure, transparent,
and incentive-compatible system for decentralized learning and distributed computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The inherent properties of blockchain,
such as immutability and traceability,
offer several benefits to FL,
making it an attractive solution for decentralized machine learning.
By incorporating blockchain into FL,
it is possible to create a robust, intelligent,
and privacy-preserving framework.
<em id="p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Blockchain-based Federated Learning</em> (BFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>
is one such solution that leverages
the benefits of both blockchain and FL to enable decentralized learning.
In BFL, local updates and global models recorded on the blockchain
to ensure security and promote traceability,
and clients can seamlessly acquire new global parameters
through a consensus mechanism.
This approach enables the system to provide an incentive mechanism for
clients and creates a transparent and trustworthy environment
for distributed machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">More importantly,
recent advances in edge computing ensure good communication
and data transmission by enabling offloading of computing tasks to
edge nodes with close proximity to the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Applying BFL to mobile edge computing (MEC) networks can shape
stunning future paradigms for the 6G era.
Examples include autonomous vehicle networks,
mobile crowdsensing and metaverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, with the advent of quantum computing,
security has become a significant concern.
Even the most secure encryption methods currently
in use can be broken by quantum computers,
which makes the confidentiality of data transmission in BFL vulnerable.
For instance,
BFL typically uses the RSA algorithm to sign and encrypt the uploaded local gradients,
which is aimed at protecting data from being tampered with or forged in transmission.
Nevertheless,
a malicious attacker equipped with a quantum computer
could undermine the security of BFL by attacking the RSA algorithm
to gain access to plaintext or even forge signatures,
thereby launching severe privacy and model attacks.
Therefore,
to counter the increasing quantum threat,
we are committed to developing new BFL-MEC systems
that employ post-quantum secure design to ensure
that quantum computing algorithms such as
Shor’s cannot efficiently solve the
cryptographic problems used in our system.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition,
MEC systems require a completely asynchronous design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>
because it is not realistic for a constantly moving client to maintain
a long communication with the edge nodes,
in contrast to FL’s synchronization assumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Additionally,
while blockchain rewards miners that successfully mined the block,
this approach does not incentivize clients to make significant contributions
to global updates in BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
As a result,
a unique incentive mechanism is necessary to attract potential participants
and retain clients who make substantial contributions.
However,
current works have not fully explored the design
and implementation of an incentive mechanism in BFL,
particularly in an asynchronous setting,
also known as vanilla BFL,
which has limited its practical applications in MEC networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Specifically,
we summarize the challenges of applying vanilla BFL
to MEC networks as follows.</p>
<ul id="S0.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S0.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S0.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S0.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fully asynchronous design.</span>
FL has a periodic
learning-updating-waiting process
while the blockchain keeps running.
In vanilla BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
the blockchain is included in the scope of the synchronicity assumption,
which means the working state of the blockchain will
exactly match the learning process of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
For example,
the blockchain will not run until the learning process starts.
Such an assumption is clearly unrealistic and also undermines
the security basis of the blockchain,
that is,
the competition between computing nodes.
At the same time,
the nature of MEC leads to the possibility that clients may
quickly lose communication with an edge node.
Overcoming this issue is a challenging undertaking
because discarding some of the local updates can
have a negative impact on global learning.
This problem can become even more complex when
the local updates recorded in the blockchain
fail to reflect the actual FL stage,
resulting in empty blocks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Therefore,
it is crucial to rethink BFL for a greenfield asynchronous design,
especially given the loss of communication in the MEC network.
As a result, redeveloping the BFL to harness fully asynchronous aspects is a non-trivial task,
especially given the problem of communication loss in the MEC network.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S0.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S0.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S0.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contribution-based incentive.</span>
One of the benefits of blockchain in FL is its ability to provide incentives,
as it rewards nodes that successfully mine blocks.
However, BFL requires a different incentive mechanism to reward clients
who contribute more to the global aggregation,
especially in data-intensive tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The challenge is to differentiate client contributions
without relying on self-reported contributions,
as this could lead to cheating by clients.
BFL cannot easily verify clients’ dishonesty due to
limitations in checking raw data.
Vanilla BFL mainly relies on self-reported contributions
or raw data checks to determine rewards,
which is insufficient for a secure and
reliable incentive mechanism.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S0.I1.i3" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S0.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S0.I1.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy-Transparency trade-off.</span>
To ensure privacy,
it is crucial to avoid making any data that might reveal
sensitive information public to all nodes in the blockchain network.
In the case of vanilla BFL,
recording all data to complete the same round of learning can
lead to the generation of more blocks. However,
since the block size is limited, it is not feasible to record
all data in the block,
as this can lead to large blocks and increase transfer time.
As a result,
the delay of vanilla BFL can be significantly high.
Therefore,
careful consideration should be given to the data
recorded in the block to reduce the delay of BFL.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S0.I1.i4" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S0.I1.i4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.I1.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S0.I1.i4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Malicious attack.</span>
In real-world scenarios, malicious attacks are everywhere.
There are various kinds of malicious attacks against BFL.
For example,
nodes curious about the data of other participants may send
carefully modified local gradients and then observe changes
in global gradients to launch membership inference attacks.
Attackers may send fake local gradients by controlling clients
or intercepting their communication to cause global model poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
While it is possible to detect data that has been tampered
with during transmission through digital signature schemes,
existing schemes are no longer secure under the threat of quantum computers.
Therefore,
it is crucial to employ a quantum-secure signature scheme
while developing a mechanism that minimizes the impact of attacks
that cannot be verified by the signature scheme
(eg, the behavior of the participants themselves).</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p">Hence,
in order to implement BFL in a practical way,
we need to consider the asynchronous design and efficient incentive mechanism.
To this end,
we improve the vanilla BFL framework by
introducing a loosely coupled architecture, mobility tolerance,
contribution-based incentive mechanism, and quantum-secure signature scheme.
These challenges have inspired us to develop <em id="p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">BFL-MEC</em>,

nodes in a blockchain network maintain a distributed ledger

When a new block is generated,

and reap the advantages of aggregate modeling.
In the FL process,
at the beginning of each communication round,
clients update their local models with their own data and compute gradients.
These gradients are then uploaded to the central server,
which aggregates them to compute the global update.
The central server then returns the global update to the clients,
who use it to update their local models independently.
This iterative process allows FL to evolve dynamically from one round to another,
resulting in a more accurate and efficient model.

The distributed nature of both blockchain and FL offers
a strong foundation for their seamless integration.
Moreover,
the decentralization feature of blockchain
empowers FL with better autonomy.
It is worth noting that
blockchain,
as a data encryption and value-driven system,
always guarantees the security of the data exchange process in the BFL.
However,
BFL design consists of non-trivial challenges as shown in <a href="#S1.F1" title="In I-B Blockchained Federated Learning (BFL) ‣ I PRELIMINARIES and Related Work ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
As an illustration,
the asynchronous characteristic of blockchain necessitates a thorough integration
with the communication rounds mechanism of FL.
Also,
there is a huge trade-off
between the transparency of blockchain and the privacy of FL.
We must carefully determine which kind of data should be public to avoid weakening privacy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is essential to avoid using local gradients for
subsequent global updates in a federated learning setting
without proper verification.
The risk of gradient attacks launched by malicious
clients, which can easily forge information,
is significant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
To mitigate the risk of gradient attacks in federated learning,
clients often generate digital signatures for
local gradients using their private keys.
Edge nodes then use clients’ public keys to verify the signatures,
ensuring that the information has not been tampered with.
However,
The great majority of extant signature algorithms rely on classical cryptography,
such as RSA.
However, as aforementioned,
these schemes are no longer robust to quantum computers.
To this end,
we use post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure that
the identities of both parties are verified and quantum security.</p>

Cryptography based on lattices is safe because it is impossible
to break with sufficient force in a reasonable amount of time,
not even with quantum computers.
In addition to multivariate cryptography,
the leading possibilities for post-quantum cryptography
also include hash-based cryptography and code-based encryption.

and replacing the RSA component of the blockchain,
we can ensure that the whole system is post-quantum secure
and can effectively withstand the threat of quantum computers.
In our design,
every client is allocated a unique private key according to their ID,
and the corresponding public key is kept by the edge nodes.
The information is verified using the client’s public key,
and the gradient information is signed with the private key
to ensure that it is not tampered with,

Vanilla BFL records every local gradient in the blockchain.
However, in the design of blockchain,
the transaction information is public to everyone.
In this case,
vanilla BFL is actually a white-box for the attacker,
malicious nodes can use this information to
perform privacy attacks and easily track the changes
in a client’s local gradient to
launch more severe model inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
BFL-MEC alleviates this risk by not storing the
original local gradients on the blockchain.
Edge nodes, in particular,
temporarily hold all unaggregated local gradients in their local cache pools,
while globally aggregated local gradients are removed to free up space.
When a new block is created,
the edge nodes construct a transaction for each unaggregated local gradient
that includes the sender’s ID, the receiver’s ID,
and the local gradient’s signature.
After that,
they group every transaction into a transaction set and include it in the block.
The created global gradient and the reward list will be the first transaction in the set
if a global update happens, in particular.
This reduces the cost of search for the clients.

The central server samples a subset of the existing clients
and sends instructions to these clients, which then start local updates.
However, in an edge computing network,
the central server cannot know precisely the current number of clients,
nor can it guarantee that the selected clients are always in a communicable state,
as they are constantly moving.
In the real world,
a fully asynchronous design is more reasonable.
To this end,
we design independent working strategies for clients
and edge nodes, respectively,

To avoid duplicate searches,
they employ an anchor to identify the block containing the last global gradient

each cluster representing a different contribution.
It is important to note that any clustering algorithm
that meets the requirements can be employed here;
nonetheless, we have chosen <em id="S2.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DBSCAN</em> as the default
algorithm in our experiments due to its efficiency and simplicity.
Clients belonging to the same cluster as the global gradient
are regarded as having made a significant contribution
and will be rewarded accordingly,
whereas those who are further from the global gradient
are considered to have made a minor contribution
and will follow a predetermined strategy.</p>

When an edge node generates a new block,
the rewards are distributed according to the reward list
and appended to the block as transactions.
Once blockchain consensus is achieved,
clients receive their rewards.

In the vanilla BFL approach,
clients need to provide information about their
data dimensions to determine the rewards they will receive.
This incentivizes clients to cheat in order to obtain more rewards,
and there is no way to verify the actual data set without violating FL’s guidelines.
In contrast,
the gradients can provide an intermediate representation that reflects
both the data size and quality.
By using them to perform <a href="#alg4" title="In II-D Accounting Client’s Contribution ‣ II BFL-MEC Design ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>,

One potential threat to the security of the global model is the possibility
of malicious clients uploading fake local gradients.
However,
the clustering algorithm employed in <a href="#alg4" title="In II-D Accounting Client’s Contribution ‣ II BFL-MEC Design ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>
can detect these spurious gradients since they differ
from the genuine ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
By adopting the discarding strategy,
we can prevent these fake gradients from skewing the global model,

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the fully asynchronous design,
the edge nodes and clients are fully autonomous according to the defined policies
so that the system latency depends mainly on
data arrival, cryptographic processes, and data transmission.
Here,
we assume that the data transmission is sound,
which is one of the advantages of edge computing.
Also,
to simplify the problem, data arrives continuously on each client.
Therefore,
only the additional delay due to the cryptographic process needs to be compared.
The baseline is the vanilla scheme RSA (adopted by the mainstream blockchain)
and the PQC candidates FALCON and Rainbow from NIST.

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be seen that RSA,
as a widely used vanilla solution,
can sign and verify digital signatures at a good speed,
but it takes more time to sign the local gradient.
In post-quantum safe schemes,
compared with RSA,
Falcon has a similar signature verification speed
while generating a key pair and digital signature faster.
Rainbow is only faster than RSA in signing,
and it takes much time to initialize the key pair.
Because Rainbow pursues the best signature size.
BFL-MEC is leading in all comparisons.
For generating key pairs,
BFL-MEC is <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">8x</span> faster than RSA and <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2x</span> faster than Falcon.
For the signature local gradient,
our method is <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">3x</span> faster than RSA,
<span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">1.5x</span> faster than Falcon and Rainbow.
For verification signatures,
BFL-MEC also outperforms all baselines.
In conclusion,
with the well-designed cryptographic approach,
BFL-MEC can achieve lower latency while guaranteeing post-quantum safety.
Hence,
BFL-MEC is more competitive for latency-sensitive computing scenarios
such as mobile edge computing.</p>

The reason could be that in the case of continuous arrivals,
the clients have to take more time to collect new data from the environment.
Meanwhile,
the slower federated model aggregation hinders local models
from learning global knowledge in time.</p>

In this case,
the federated model has the lowest accuracy and the slowest convergence speed.
The intuition behind that is a small <math id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.11.m11.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math>,
although it enables more local gradients to be uploaded simultaneously,
impairs the learning effect due to the small training data size used by the client.
That is,
the negative effect of insufficient data suppresses the

We would like to emphasize that any appropriate clustering algorithm could be applied here,

However,
while <em id="S4.SS2.p1.2.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedProx</em> removes stragglers to prevent global model skewness,
our approach excludes low-contributing clients based on the results of the clustering algorithm.

In this section, we evaluate the security of the proposed

We simulate an attack scenario where some clients intentionally
modify their local gradients to skew the global model.
Specifically,
during each upload of the local gradient,
the malicious clients significantly increase or
decrease the value of the actual gradient in some direction,
expecting to perform membership inference attack by
analyzing the resulting change in the federated model.
It is a typical privacy attack technique proposed in the study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

we can see that when the data distribution of clients satisfies IID,
the detection rate of malicious attacks is at a high level from
the very beginning (about 67%) and eventually stabilizes at close to 80%.
This implies that, given that the vast majority of clients are honest,
the impact of malicious clients can be clearly detected
as their modified local gradients are significantly
different from the normal ones.
In the case of IID,
such differences are more easily identified.
On the contrary,
if the data distribution of clients is heterogeneous,
the attacker’s forged local gradients may successfully escape detection
by the mechanism at the beginning of the learning process.
Nevertheless,
with a few global aggregations,
the detection rate will boost quickly and
eventually reach the optimal level (about 66%).
To put it differently,
the detection rate of malicious nodes is observed
to increase with the convergence of the model.
This is because,
as the model converges,
the local gradients become more similar to each other,
and the modified gradients used by malicious clients are more distant from the normal ones.
Thus,
the clustering algorithm can more effectively detect the anomalies.
In the case of IID,
the distribution of data is good,
and normal gradients are more spatially concentrated,
making it easier to detect anomalies from the beginning.
However,
in the case of non-IID,
the detection rate can also be achieved gradually as the model
converges.
These results indicate that <em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">BFL-MEC</em> can resist malicious attacks effectively,
whether in the case of IID or non-IID data distributions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From <a href="#S4.F9.sf2" title="In Figure 9 ‣ IV-C Security by Design ‣ IV Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a>,
clients identified by the discard strategy as low contributing will not be rewarded,
so that the cumulative reward curve will appear as a straight line.
We can see that many local gradients of honest clients are also discarded at the beginning,
and only a few honest clients are rewarded.
However,
as long as they remain honest,
all of them will be rewarded after a few global aggregations and
will end up with a significantly higher reward than malicious clients.
Such a result is caused by Non-IID,
which coincides with <a href="#S4.F9.sf1" title="In Figure 9 ‣ IV-C Security by Design ‣ IV Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a>.
Thus the effectiveness of the discard strategy is proved.
Although some malicious clients survive the discarding strategy,
the fair aggregation will still play a role as the second guarantee.
In such a case,
the rewards earned by malicious clients will be minimal,
and the entire cumulative reward curve barely rises.
In addition,
the final rewards obtained are different for honest clients,
thus capturing the differences in contributions.
This means that <a href="#alg4" title="In II-D Accounting Client’s Contribution ‣ II BFL-MEC Design ‣ Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> achieves the goal of

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper,
we develop a blockchain-based federated learning framework
for mobile edge computing, called BFL-MEC,
which aims to provide the foundation for future paradigms
in this field such as autonomous vehicles,
mobile crowd sensing, and metaverse.
We propose several mechanisms to address the performance,
motivational, and security challenges faced by vanilla BFL.
First, we propose a fully asynchronous design in which the
client and edge nodes have independent working policies
that can tolerate connection loss due to mobility in the MEC network.
Second, we use a signature scheme based on post-quantum cryptography,
which makes the proposed framework resilient to threats from quantum
computers and reduces the latency of the signature-verification process.
Third,
we propose a contribution-based incentive mechanism that
allows the use of multiple clustering algorithms to discover
differences in client contributions and then assign personalized rewards.
Finally,
we developed a fair aggregation mechanism that computing
the global model based on the weight of the client’s contribution
minimizes the impact of attacks from the clients themselves.</p>
