<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple machines to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing of private training data.
Yet, especially for heterogeneous models, a key bottleneck remains the transfer of knowledge gained from each client model with the server.
One popular method, FedDF, uses distillation to tackle this task with the use of a common, shared dataset on which predictions are exchanged.
However, in many contexts such a dataset might be difficult to acquire due to privacy and the clients might not allow for storage of a large shared dataset.
To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new method that improves this knowledge distillation method to only rely on a single shared image between clients and server.
In particular, we propose a novel adaptive dataset pruning algorithm that selects the most informative crops generated from only a single image.
With this, we show that federated learning with distillation under a limited shared dataset budget works better by using a single image compared to multiple individual ones.
Finally, we extend our approach to allow for training heterogeneous client architectures by incorporating a non-uniform distillation schedule and client-model mirroring on the server side.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful predictive models without the need to centralize the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. It comes with its own set of key challenges in terms of skewed non-IID distribution of data between the participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and communication efficiency during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> among others. These challenges are not directly answered with the classical approaches such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which rely primarily on a naive client network parameter sharing approach. Since the inclusion of clients with different data distributions has a factor of heterogeneity involved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, another well-known work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> counteracts this heterogeneity directly during the client training. This tries to solve one challenge related to non-iidness in private data distribution, but other key challenges related to network parameter sharing remain including concerns with privacy leakage during parameter sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, heterogeneity of client architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and high bandwidth cost of parameter sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To this end, along a second line of thought implementing a server-side training regime, approaches suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> make use of the process of knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to overcome these challenges without the exclusive need of network parameter sharing. To facilitate central network training with the help of KD, the sharing of public data is needed between the clients and the server.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel approach of making use of a single datum source to act as the shared distillation dataset in ensembled distillation-based federated learning strategies. Our approach makes use of a novel adaptive dataset pruning algorithm on top of generating the distillation data from a single source image during the training. This combination of shared data generation and instance selection process not only allows us to train the central model effectively but also outperforms the other approaches which make use of multiple small-sized images in place of a single image under a limited shared dataset budget. The use of a single datum source has added benefits in domains, where publicly available data and client resources (e.g., network bandwidth and connectivity) are limited in nature. The use of a single datum source has been explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> under the settings of self-supervised learning and understanding extrapolation capabilities of neural networks with knowledge distillation, but it has not yet been explored in federated setting for facilitating model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We perform a series of experiments to examine the viability of our proposed algorithm under varying conditions of heterogeneity in private client data, client-server model architectures, rate of pre-training network initializations before distillation, shared dataset storage budget, and real-world domain of the single images. We also extend our experiments to a use case of heterogeneous client architectures involved during a single federated training with the help of client-model mirroring on the server side. To facilitate this, we keep one copy of the client model of each type on the server end, which acts as a global model for the clients that have the same network architecture. The global models are improved with knowledge distillation after each round of local client training with the help of shared logits over the single image dataset. The results we obtain during the aforementioned experiments demonstrate positive reinforcement towards reaching our goal of efficient federated training using Knowledge Distillation under a limited shared dataset budget.</p>

Knowledge Distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has been shown to successfully transfer the knowledge of an ensemble of neural networks into a single network with the means of output logits over a shared dataset. KD has also been leveraged in federated settings, such as Federated Distillation Fusion (FedDF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and Federated Ensemble Distillation (FedED) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where the respective authors make use of KD to allow robust and faster convergence on top of using other ensembling methods such as the ones suggested in Federated Averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for initializing the central network before the distillation training of the global model. On the other hand, authors of works such as Federated Model Distillation (FedMD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have also successfully shown that KD can be used for knowledge transfer in a federated setting for the purpose of client model personalization. However, the application of algorithms such as FedMD is targetted for personalization by client-side knowledge distillation rather than improvement of a central model, hence we have not delved into it in the scope of our research. In the case of ensembling methods, it has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> that in the absence of an ensemble of local parameters before distillation training, the final test performance of the central network tends to suffer. As a result, these methods have been shown by the authors to significantly rely on parameter exchange every round similar to naive parameter exchange-based algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for robust performance on top of KD. Since the aforementioned KD-based federated algorithms also require significant regular ensembling using network parameter exchange, our approach focuses on improving this aspect by relying significantly on knowledge distillation with the help of data pruning and augmentations on the shared public dataset, which has not yet been explored in these works.</p>

To solve the high bandwidth costs related to parameter sharing, authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have shown that quantization of network parameters before the transfer can significantly reduce the bandwidth costs incurred during their transfer. However, with the application of the same low-bit quantization methods with the KD-based federated learning methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors have also shown a significant decrease in the overall test performance of models compared to their non-quantized counterparts. On the other hand to not rely on public data sources, authors of the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have successfully shown that data-free approaches using a centrally trained generative network for producing the public shared dataset work robustly. However, this also requires an additional exchange of the generative network parameters before each round, which leads to an increase in the network bandwidth usage itself. In pursuit of reducing the bandwidth costs pertaining to network parameter exchanges as well as shared dataset sharing, these works have not yet made an attempt to make use of a storage-efficient single data source, which can simultaneously generate a public distillation dataset alongside being used for dynamic selection without added bandwidth costs. We explore this in our work.</p>

Asano et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have successfully made use of a single image to produce augmented patches for facilitating self-supervised learning of useful representations required for solving various downstream tasks. However, the focus of our work is not on the process of solving tasks with the help of self-supervised learning, but on the implications of making use of the single image patches in a federated setting as a medium of knowledge transfer for training robust classifiers. To this end, in a closely resembling work to our target task, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> have shown to be able to successfully use KD with single image patches to transfer the knowledge between a pre-trained network and an untrained network to solve the classification task of ImageNet-1k. However, the experiments by the authors were all based in a non-federated setting. In our work, we explore the usage of single image patches in a federated setting as the shared public distillation dataset and its implications in limited shared dataset budget settings.</p>

If we also lower the network budget and the rate of exchange of initialization parameters, it is able to hold at par with individual training samples 10 times its size. This shows a promising future for our work in the scenario where there is limited availability of publicly shared datasets as well as storage budget would be low on participating clients.</p>

To test the impact of high data distribution heterogeneity on our FL strategy against an existing SOTA federated learning strategy based on knowledge distillation, we show the performance gains in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Network and Storage Conditions ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We also vary the network initialization rate to test our method in high and low-bandwidth situations. We notice that with the help of patch subset selection, our methods outperform the fed strategy which doesn’t make use of this process. This trend is constant across all bandwidth scenarios and local client training expenditures. We have also extended our approach to incorporate FedProx local client training regime, which shows better results than naive local client training. This extendability makes our method unique and viable to more approaches than just one kind of local training which can have added performance benefits with our algorithm.</p>

We perform all the experiments in the earlier sections using ResNet-8 as the client and server models. To make sure our federated strategy works equally well among other homogeneous network distributions, we put it to the test against FedDF using ResNet-20 as well as W-ResNet-16-4 in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3 Client-Server Neural Network Architectures ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. We see that under the same distillation set storage budget, our method works better under all the tested network architectures. As per nominal expectations, network architectures with more parameters show better results than the ones with less number of parameters which enables us to achieve better test performance with more complex networks. Irrespective of the network architecture, the trend is constant when it comes to our FL strategy outperforming other strategies making use of a labelled distillation dataset in a limited storage budget scenario.</p>

It also exhibits the importance of constant distillation training for the success of our methods, as our non-uniform approach gives subpar results with less training time. However, when going from 15k to 11k steps, we also save about 1/3 of the training time and computation resources used on the server side. It can be an interesting point of extension to our work to improve upon this non-uniform scheduling to allow for more robust training of heterogeneous models with less computation time.</p>

On their own, both KMeans Balancing (<a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Distillation Dataset Pruning - Subset Selection ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>) and Entropy Selection (<a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Distillation Dataset Pruning - Subset Selection ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>) strategy works better than employing no selection for the same number of patches. Together, they perform best across all the datasets we have tested which is what we use in our other experiments in this work. Both of the selection strategies and their combination significantly impact the final performance. We have done our primitive analysis with them in light of this work to find an optimal setting (Appendix C, but there might be a correlation between their settings which we have not delved into. We can propose this detailed analysis of their combinative work as future work for improving the test performance of our federated strategy with the means of better data pruning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct cross-dataset single-image testing using our algorithm across 3 private training datasets and 3 images, with two of them corresponding to one of the dataset domains and the third one being a random noise.

In the case of using a single random noise image as the distillation proxy, we get the lowest test performance as it is hard for random augmentations to convert random noise patches into a knowledge transfer medium. Hence, care must be taken in choosing a single image with similar patch representations as the target task for optimal learning with our algorithm. There can be an interesting area to explore with more augmentation experiments and generative algorithms if it is possible to use a random noise image viably as a single image with our method. We leave this as future work.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Through this work, we present a novel approach for federated learning using ensembled knowledge distillation with the use of augmented image patches from a single image with patch subset selection. We successfully exhibit the performance gains with our approach in a limited shared dataset budget scenario as well as low network bandwidth requiring scenarios with less exchange of network parameters. Alongside low resource usage, the use of a single image also enables our federated strategy to be applicable to scenarios where we have a lack of public datasets required during federated training of multiple clients.

Its implications have been discussed in the main paper in brief detail. To add to the earlier analysis, by looking at the difference between Fig. <a href="#S3.F2.sf1" title="Figure 2(a) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Distillation Dataset Pruning - Subset Selection ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S3.F2.sf2" title="Figure 2(b) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Distillation Dataset Pruning - Subset Selection ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>, one can see how the embedding layer in the neural network starts forming particular regions belonging to certain classes with the increase in classification accuracy. Even though the image representations do not contain many of the classes in the classifier as is prevalent from visual inspection of Fig. <a href="#A2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ B.1 Visualisation of Single Images ‣ Appendix B Image and Patch Visualisations ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the pseudo labels are powerful enough to enable the learning through knowledge distillation in a federated setting.</p>

<div id="A3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To examine the impact of KMeans Balancing and its corresponding settings on the federated training, we conduct experiments while varying their values on multiple datasets having different numbers of prediction labels. The results have been presented in Table <a href="#A3.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ C.1 KMeans Balancing ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. Although values do not differ by a large margin for CIFAR10, CIFAR100 results provide us more assurance for the optimal values. We find that the KMeans selection strategy works best with a high number of clusters (K) compared to the number of classes in the corresponding classification problem (Table <a href="#A3.T8.st1" title="Table 8(a) ‣ Table 8 ‣ C.1 KMeans Balancing ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(a)</span></a>), while forcing maximum class balancing while pruning (Table <a href="#A3.T8.st2" title="Table 8(b) ‣ Table 8 ‣ C.1 KMeans Balancing ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(b)</span></a>) as well as selecting the hard examples (Table <a href="#A3.T8.st3" title="Table 8(c) ‣ Table 8 ‣ C.1 KMeans Balancing ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(c)</span></a>) for distillation. Since the KMeans model is an independent model working on giving the pseudo-labels to the distillation training examples, there could be a play of correlation between the 3 hyper-parameters for this mechanism. It can be an interesting point for future research on this.</p>

<p id="A3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the entropy selection mechanism, we only have 2 settings to vary: Removal Percentage and Heuristics (Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Distillation Dataset Pruning - Subset Selection ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>). The results obtained during ablation studies with these settings have been presented in Table <a href="#A3.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ C.2 Entropy Selection ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.

Removing a high percentage of training examples from a large initial set using this mechanism also provided us with more robust training, compared to removing a smaller number of training examples from a small initial set (Table <a href="#A3.T9.st2" title="Table 9(b) ‣ Table 9 ‣ C.2 Entropy Selection ‣ Appendix C Finding Optimal Hyper-Parameters for Selection Algorithms ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image Appendix ‣ Federated Learning with a Single Shared Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a>). Similar to our last experiments with the KMeans mechanism, the results are more clearly pronounced in the presence of a more difficult dataset (100 classes compared to 10 in the case of CIFAR100 and CIFAR10).</p>
