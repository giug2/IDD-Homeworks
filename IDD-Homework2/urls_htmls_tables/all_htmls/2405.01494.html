<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train models collectively while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges in terms of communication cost and data heterogeneity. One-shot federated learning has emerged as a solution by reducing communication rounds, improving efficiency, and providing better security against eavesdropping attacks. Nevertheless, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge, impacting performance. This work explores the effectiveness of diffusion models in one-shot FL, demonstrating their applicability in addressing data heterogeneity and improving FL performance. Additionally, we investigate the utility of our diffusion model approach, FedDiff, compared to other one-shot FL methods under differential privacy (DP). Furthermore, to improve generated sample quality under DP settings, we propose a pragmatic Fourier Magnitude Filtering (FMF) method, enhancing the effectiveness of generated data for global model training.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple clients to participate in the training process in a privacy-preserving manner. In FL, each client trains a local model on its own data and sends the model to a central server. The server combines these updates to improve the global model, which is then sent back to the clients. This approach ensures that the clients’ data is kept private while enabling the central server to learn from the collective knowledge of all participating users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL poses significant challenges in terms of communication cost and data heterogeneity across clients. Communication cost is a major bottleneck in FL systems, as clients need to communicate frequently with the server over multiple rounds during the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This leads to a high communication overhead, making the process slow or simply infeasible. To overcome this challenge, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">one-shot federated learning</span> has recently gained traction in the research community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In this setting, clients only communicate once with the server during the training process, significantly reducing the communication requirements.
This approach not only improves the efficiency of the training process but also provides a better framework for privacy and application.
Specifically, one-shot FL provides better security against eavesdropping attacks, where adversaries attempt to steal or tamper with the information being sent between clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. By only requiring one round of communication, one-shot FL significantly reduces the likelihood of such attacks.
Furthermore, traditional multi-round training may not be a practical option in some cases, such as that of model markets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In these scenarios, models are trained to convergence by a participating user, and simply made available as a pretrained model to potential buyers, without any option for iterative communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, another significant challenge in federated learning still remains, and that is, the data heterogeneity problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
In FL, clients often have very different data distributions, making optimization particularly challenging across the federated system.
In the one-shot setting, this is especially detrimental to performance. Without the luxury of multiple communication rounds, the resulting models will be significantly biased towards their narrow data distribution and difficult to reconcile into a global model.
Knowledge distillation-based approaches have been studied in the literature in an attempt to address these problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
Nonetheless, these methods still struggle immensely under high heterogeneity, resulting in large drops in performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Yet, another class of model is potentially well-suited for such heterogeneous distributions at the clients. Rather than simply employing discriminative models to train on the clients, one could instead leverage generative models. These generative models can then be gathered from the clients and inferenced on the server to form a dataset for global model training, eliminating the need for the challenging reconciliation process required for discriminative models. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> conducted a preliminary study of such a framework with conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> for one-shot FL, but there is still much to investigate in this paradigm. <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Specifically, we consider two primary research questions (RQ) in this work.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">RQ1</span>. First, we explore the utility of diffusion models in federated learning and their potential for improving the performance of the one-shot FL process.
Diffusion models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have recently emerged as prominent approaches for image generation, inspiring our investigation.
We suggest that specific traits of diffusion models could provide advantages for one-shot FL, as discussed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Diffusion Models for Federated Learning ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. We then validate this hypothesis through comprehensive experiments with our approach, FedDiff, across various settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">RQ2</span>. Second, we investigate one-shot FL methods under provable privacy budgets with differential privacy (DP),
as this aspect is not addressed by existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) one-shot FL works.
Safeguarding model privacy is critical in this setting, as the client models obtained in one-shot FL can be reused multiple times or even traded in a model market.
Furthermore, in light of recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, we examine the potential memorization of diffusion models within our FedDiff approach and the effectiveness of DP as a mitigation strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">After studying these research questions, we further explore a simple technique for improving the performance of our FedDiff method under DP settings.
We observe that the quality of generated samples may deteriorate under DP constraints, rendering some samples counterproductive to the training of the global model. To improve the quality and consistency of the synthetic data, we propose a straightforward filtering approach, termed Fourier Magnitude Filtering (FMF). FMF leverages sample magnitudes derived from the Fourier transform to guide the selection of valuable samples. The resulting filtered dataset substantially improves the utility of the generated data, particularly in challenging conditions, as detailed in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Fourier Magnitude Filtering ‣ 5 RQ2: Privacy Considerations ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. The seminal work by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> introduced the concept of FL, where model updates are computed locally on user devices and aggregated on a central server.
However, in the standard FL process, many iterative communication rounds are required for convergence. One-shot FL, therefore, studies how to effectively learn in this distributed setting in a single round, thereby mitigating the need for many communication rounds. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle the unique characteristics of one-shot FL.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> introduce the one-shot federated learning framework and study several baseline approaches. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, distillation approaches are studied using the ensemble of client models to the global model, and assume a public dataset for this purpose. However, such an assumption is limited, as public data related to the domain of interest is often not available. A data-free method within the distillation methodology was proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, where a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained at the server level to generate the data for distillation, and iteratively optimized between distilling to the server model and training the GAN with the ensemble of client models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, these methods still struggle with heterogeneous environments, as we find in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Diffusion Models for Federated Learning ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Generative models on the client are well-suited for better undertaking in such settings, as they can focus on the narrow client distributions and simply generate data at the central location. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> introduce the use of CVAEs in highly heterogeneous one-shot FL. <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">However, CVAEs exhibit suboptimal sample quality, a limitation that becomes markedly exacerbated with more complex datasets and when subjected to the constraints of DP, which are not explicitly addressed in the study by</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

Simply put, DMs aim to learn the backward process that can iteratively denoise an image corrupted with Gaussian noise back to the original. Specifically, as detailed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, noise is introduced to a given sample via a Markovian chain forward process</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train deep learning models with such guarantees, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) is typically employed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In DPSGD, two main mechanisms are used to protect the privacy of individual data points: per-sample gradient clipping and the addition of random noise to the clipped gradients. Per-sample gradient clipping involves setting a maximum threshold on the norm of the gradient computed for each data point, so that if the norm of a gradient exceeds the threshold, it is rescaled. This step is necessary to limit the sensitivity of the loss function, which measures how much the loss function changes when a single data point is removed from the training dataset. After the gradients have been clipped, random noise is added to them before they are used to update the model parameters. The amount of noise added is calibrated based on privacy budget parameters <math id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\epsilon,\delta)" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><mo id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">δ</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.3" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.3.2"><ci id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci><ci id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2">𝛿</ci></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.p2.1.m1.2c">(\epsilon,\delta)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before delving into the underlying motivation for our research questions <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">RQ1</span> and <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">RQ2</span>, it is essential to provide a brief exposition of the one-shot FL process when integrating generative models. The core premise of this approach departs from the traditional method of client-side discriminative model training. Instead, it advocates for the training of generative models on the client devices.
These client-side generative models are aggregated and used offline on the server side to synthesize data, which, in turn, facilitates the training of a global discriminative model. Within the scope of our study, we undertake an investigation into the viability of leveraging diffusion models in this paradigm.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Why diffusion models?</span> In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, a generative learning trilemma is shown with model types, trading off sample quality, diversity, and fast sampling. CVAEs (as employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>) are typically identified to excel in diversity and fast sampling, but lacking in sample quality. However, for one-shot federated learning, fast sampling is not a concern, as the sampling can be done offline at the server (Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 One-shot Federated Learning ‣ 2 Background and Preliminaries ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Therefore, <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">high sample quality and diversity are more valuable properties in one-shot FL</span>, as these will positively impact the performance of the trained global model with the synthetic data.

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, while CVAEs and diffusion models share a common origin in terms of their objective, they differ in their approach to achieving this objective.
The optimization task of the diffusion model is simplified to learning a Markov process to reverse a fixed forward process. The training is structured such that the model only needs to learn how to denoise a small step in the generation process, breaking down the problem.
In contrast, CVAEs must simultaneously learn both the forward process to encode the image to a latent space, and the decoding process from that latent vector. We reason that the simplified objective of DMs helps achieve superior performance when dealing with complex data within the challenging FL environment (data heterogeneity, class imbalance, and limited sample sizes). Moreover, in the FL setting, privacy is of critical importance. To ensure privacy, training is done with DP, which introduces noise to the training process and increases the difficulty of optimization. In these settings, the simpler training paradigm of diffusion models is potentially advantageous.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity is a critical challenge in FL, particularly with one-shot settings. Even in the standard FL scenario of multiple communication rounds, client models often fit to very different distributions, and effectively reconciling their learnings is daunting. This is exacerbated in the one-shot setting, as we no longer have the luxury of getting many iterations to progressively steer the learning process towards an ideal encompassing representation.</p>

In the case of CIFAR-10, which is the most complex of the datasets, we find that FedDiff provides the most improvement. As discussed in our initial motivations (Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Diffusion Models for Federated Learning ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), we reason that the focus on sample quality and diversity that is provided by the DM objective enables much improved performance. Intuitively, this becomes increasingly evident in more complex settings. To verify this observation, we conduct a comparative analysis of generated samples produced by FedCVAE and our FedDiff approach, illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Data Heterogeneity ‣ 4 RQ1: FedDiff for One-Shot FL ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The discernible disparity is evident, with the samples generated by our method exhibiting significantly enhanced sharpness and overall quality.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One question arising from the adoption of generative models in FL settings pertains to their ability to maintain satisfactory performance when trained on a limited number of samples.
Interestingly, when analyzing the results, we find that FedDiff is capable of handling a much smaller number of client training samples with little to no performance degradation. On the other hand, the discriminative model approaches quickly experience a collapse in performance when expanding to 20 clients. In the heterogeneous environment of federated learning, the local optimization of a discriminative model on a highly-imbalanced and small dataset proves challenging. Rather than being an overwelming burden, such a situation is handled well by FedDiff, as its sole focus is to capture the subsequently smaller distribution. Furthermore, we again find that FedDiff outperforms FedCVAE in all settings, further illustrating the potential for diffusion models in one-shot FL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is pertinent to emphasize that training diffusion models within the FedDiff framework is <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">no more intricate than conventional methodologies and remains highly viable for FL</span>. The computational complexity aligns with training a conventional CNN model with a modest number of parameters, and we employ the same number of local epochs as previous work with CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Importantly, the training process entails selecting random steps in the diffusion process at any given training iteration, eliminating the necessity for sequential steps during training. During inference, the generation process involves sequential denoising steps; however, this poses no issue for the clients, as generation occurs at the server in FedDiff.
Therefore, FedDiff is an effective and practical approach for providing strong performance.</p>

DP training introduces noise into the training process, exacerbating the complexity of optimization. In such scenarios, the simplicity of the training paradigm employed by diffusion models becomes notably advantageous. Overall, we show that FedDiff is a strong approach even when DP is employed.</p>

Specifically, from each DP-trained diffusion model, we generate a vast number of samples (five times the size of the training set). Subsequently, for each generated image, we assess potential memorization compared to the original training samples using the adaptive distance metric introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While FedDiff performs comparatively well against other SOTA one-shot FL methods under DP constraints, we further investigate a simple approach to improve our method,
particularly for complex data most affected by DP.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Addressing Memorization ‣ 5 RQ2: Privacy Considerations ‣ Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we note that the generated samples under DP can lack details, exhibiting reduced structure.
Therefore, it may be advantageous to sort out and remove such poor quality samples from the final synthetic dataset prior to conducting the training of the global model.

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to understand the impact of prioritizing data quality on performance, we conducted an initial experiment. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, we leverage a centralized pretrained classifier as an oracle to discern high and low quality samples. Specifically, we selectively retain samples for which the oracle accurately classifies and discarded those it misclassifies. This provides a way to filter out samples that are likely irrelevant or misleading for training a model. We then train the global model exclusively on the curated dataset of accurate samples and evaluate. This investigation yields a discernible improvement ranging from approximately 2% to 4% in final global model accuracy compared to training with all generated data, verifying an importance for data quality. Therefore, a critical question arises from this observation: how can we conduct sample filtration in the absence of an oracle?</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To do so, we look to the Fourier domain for a potential source of information. As inspiration, we note that the use of the magnitude of local client images has been utilized in FL to assist in domain generalization across clients by providing low-level “style" information without the high-level semantics encoded in the phase <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In our case, we propose to leverage the Fourier magnitude information as a potential referenceable indicator to guide the sample filtering process. Furthermore, we are able to do so under very tight DP guarantees.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our work addresses two valuable research questions in one-shot FL. Firstly, we investigate the potential of diffusion models for one-shot FL, and present the pioneering effort in this direction.
In our investigation, we unveil the unique advantages that DMs offer, showcasing their potential to enhance the overall performance and tackle heterogeneity across diverse settings with our proposed approach, FedDiff.
Secondly, we study privacy in SOTA one-shot FL and contribute a thorough investigation under provable privacy budgets, as well as address memorization concerns.
Furthermore, to enhance performance under harsh DP conditions, we propose a novel and pragmatic solution, Fourier Magnitude Filtering, to boost the efficacy of generated data for global model training by eliminating low-quality samples. More discussions, including limitations and broader impact, are included in the <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Supplementary Material</span>. We hope our work will inspire the community and foster further research in this direction to improve one-shot FL with generative models.</p>

Our findings indicate that, in general, data filtering within the 1% to 10% range yields favorable results and leads to performance enhancements, with around 5% being a great default. Interestingly, the the degree of improvement provided by FMF becomes more pronounced and consistent as the dataset becomes more challenging. This phenomenon aligns with the anticipated trends, as more intricate datasets inherently pose a greater challenge, making it less likely for the generators to consistently produce high-quality samples. Consequently, the need for data filtering becomes more pronounced in such scenarios to enhance sample quality.
This trend is also favorable since it addresses the specific need for improvement, especially in cases where performance is suboptimal and the challenges are more pronounced.</p>

<p id="S7.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Model Heterogeneity</span>. In real FL systems, model heterogeneity may often occur <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. For instance, some clients may have architecture variations in their models or have smaller or larger models depending on their computing capabilities. Therefore, clients may have different architectures of similar generation capability, or even differing capabilities depending on the requirements of each client. Our approach allows for flexibility to accommodate such system diversity across clients. In FedDiff, we generate data from the client models and employ that synthetic data for global training, and therefore can leverage varying models without the worry of reconciling the weights themselves.</p>

<p id="S7.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations and Broader Impact</span>.
One downside of our method is that the generated data, particularly under DP constraints, still lacks in quality and effectiveness for global model training versus using true data. For instance, with DP on CIFAR-10 as shown in Figure 4 in the main paper, the data loses a substantial amount of structure. An interesting direction for future work would be to study how to further improve the quality of the generated data and its usefulness for global model training while maintaining privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Looking at the broader impact of our work, FL depends on the diversity of data contributed by different participants. If biases exist in the local datasets, they can be propagated and amplified during the model training process. This could lead to unintended algorithmic biases and discrimination in the resulting models. Ensuring diversity and fairness in the data used for FL is an important research direction to mitigate this risk and promote equitable outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, particularly in the highly data heterogeneous environments explored in this work.
Furthermore, as we have discussed throughout our paper, the privacy of client data is important in FL. To mitigate risks in this regard, we take many precautions to preserve privacy of the clients participated in the FL process though the use of DP, and operating within the one-shot setting to reduce the chance of eavesdropping.</p>
