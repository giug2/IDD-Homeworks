<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a bridge member damage cause estimation framework is proposed by calculating the image position using Structure from Motion (SfM) and acquiring its information via Visual Question Answering (VQA). For this, a VQA model was developed that uses bridge images for dataset creation and outputs the damage or member name and its existence based on the images and questions. In the developed model, the correct answer rate for questions requiring the member’s name and the damage’s name were 67.4% and 68.9%, respectively. The correct answer rate for questions requiring a yes/no answer was 99.1%. Based on the developed model, a damage cause estimation method was proposed. In the proposed method, the damage causes are narrowed down by inputting new questions to the VQA model, which are determined based on the surrounding images obtained via SfM and the results of the VQA model. Subsequently, the proposed method was then applied to an actual bridge and shown to be capable of determining damage and estimating its cause. The proposed method could be used to prevent damage causes from being overlooked, and practitioners could determine inspection focus areas, which could contribute to the improvement of maintenance techniques. In the future, it is expected to contribute to infrastructure diagnosis automation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Aging infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels can cause serious accidents if left unattended. According to the ASCE’s 2021 Infrastructure Report Card <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, there are more than 617,000 bridges in the United States, 42% of which are more than 50 years old, and 7.5%, or 46,154 bridges, are structurally deficient or in ‘poor’ condition. Owning to this pressing issue of aging infrastructure, there has been increased research interest in proper infrastructure safety assessment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. In addition, regular condition assessment and monitoring are important to properly assess infrastructure safety <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. However, currently, infrastructure condition assessment is performed visually, which requires extensive effort and cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Various studies have been conducted to address this problem and realize efficient maintenance management. In recent years, research on damage detection from images using machine learning techniques has been conducted. Cha et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a crack detection method from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> conducted a study on pixel-level crack detection using fully convolutional networks. Chun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> developed a pixel-level crack detection method for concrete walls using a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine. Wang &amp; Hu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, and Chun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a deep-learning-based crack detection method for pavements. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposed a damage detection framework based on restricted Boltzmann machines to detect cracks in box girders. Besides crack and fissure detection studies, various studies have been conducted on other types of damage detection. Liang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> conducted pixel-level concrete delamination detection research. Fondevik et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Rahman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a pixel-level corrosion damage detection method from images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Research is also actively being conducted to record the detected damage in a three-dimensional (3D) bridge model. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a method to record cracks detected from images in a 3D pier model. In addition, Yamane et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> proposed a damage location recording method using an object detection model in a 3D bridge model. Other studies have been conducted on methods to record damage and non-damage areas detected from images in a 3D bridge model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned, many studies have been conducted on damage detection from images. Damage detection from images using the aforementioned methods is expected to reduce labour during inspections and contribute to a more efficient infrastructure maintenance. These studies contribute to damage detection automation; however, little attention is paid to how to utilize the information obtained from such images. Hence, it would be of great help to infrastructure maintenance engineers if machines could not only detect damage from images, but also estimate its cause. As an example of estimating the cause of damage, one can imagine a case where corrosion is detected, and it is estimated that it is caused by a leak from a nearby drainage pipe. As mentioned above, if the cause of damage can be estimated, it is believed that not only automated inspection, but also automated diagnosis and labour savings will be possible. Furthermore, damage cause estimation automation is useful in and of itself. For example, for inexperienced engineers, this may lead to careful confirmation of the damage cause presented to the machine, effectively preventing overlooking it. Moreover, based on suggestions from the machine, it would also contribute to improving the maintenance skills of novice engineers, as they could learn where to focus in each case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For damage cause estimation from images, it is necessary to obtain information not only on the damage but also on related members. If a simple image classification model is used to obtain information, it is possible that the combined information in the image may be mistaken. For example, in the case of an image of the main girder and slab of a steel girder bridge, if the main girder is corroded and the slab is cracked, the model that determines the member’s name may judge that it is the main girder, while the model that determines the damage name may judge that it is cracked. In this case, the individual classification model would be correct; however, it would not correctly determine which damage is occurring in which member.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">An approach to obtain output that takes into account the relationship between member and damage names has been studied using an image captioning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In that study, a model is developed to output sentences regarding the damage and the member in which the damage occurs from bridge images, making it possible to obtain information that includes the relationships between words. However, there are many possible patterns in the text that can be output based on an image. Thus, for example, if multiple damages or members are present in an image simultaneously, there is a possibility that something other than the desired information will be output.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To address this problem and obtain information from images as needed, it is necessary to use a model that can input images and questions into the model and produce output in accordance with the input content. This task is called Visual Question Answering (VQA) and has been actively studied in the field of computer vision. Meanwhile, to estimate the cause of the damage in the image, it is also necessary to acquire the surrounding conditions. However, the damage and the information related to its cause are not necessarily captured in a single image. For example, it is quite possible that an image of a particular corrosion case does not show a leaky drainage pipe that could be the cause of the damage. Therefore, when estimating the cause, it is necessary to analyse not only the image of interest but also multiple images in the surrounding area and make a decision based on the results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Accordingly, we propose a damage cause estimation method by calculating the camera coordinates using Structure from Motion (SfM), a technique to calculate the coordinates at which images were taken, and extracting information from the images via VQA using multiple images taken around the damage based on the calculated camera coordinates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, the acquisition method for images around the image of interest using SfM is explained. Then, the training process of the VQA model using bridge images is explained. Afterward, a damage cause estimation method based on the output of the developed VQA model is explained. Field test results are presented next after applying the proposed method to an actual bridge structure. Finally, the conclusions of this study are summarized.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In damage cause estimation, it is desirable not to use a single image alone; surrounding images are also needed. For this, the coordinates of the camera that captured each image must be calculated to determine the area of the bridge from which each image was taken. SfM is a method that can calculate the shooting coordinates of each image based on multiple images. This is a technique that detects common feature points between images from each image and calculates the camera position based on epipolar geometry. SfM is a well-known method for image-based 3D scene and surface reconstruction, a key challenge in the field of computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The dense point cloud data of an object can be constructed based on the positions of each camera determined via SfM and stereo matching results using multiple images. The dense point cloud data can also be used to construct a polygon mesh model with a triangular mesh.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, SfM is used to calculate the shooting coordinates of each image and to determine the images surrounding the image of interest. SfM is a commonly used technology, and there are various commercially available software packages for SfM-based 3D modelling. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is applicable regardless of the type of SfM software.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In selecting images surrounding the image of interest, it is not appropriate to simply use images whose camera coordinates are close to those of the camera that took the image of interest. This is because if the cameras are facing in different directions, it is possible that they are capturing images of areas that are far from the damage. Even if the camera coordinates are far, it is possible that the camera is capturing a close area from a different direction. Therefore, in this study, we calculate the intersection of the bridge mesh model created based on the SfM results and the camera direction vectors; this intersection is used as the coordinates of the point where the image was taken. Based on these coordinates, the surrounding images are selected.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The mesh model created based on the SfM results consists of a set of triangular meshes. Therefore, the mesh model intersection points can be calculated by computing the triangular meshes that intersect the direction vectors of the camera whose coordinates have already been identified, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Shooting area and surrounding images ‣ 3 Acquisition of images surrounding the image of interest ‣ Bridge Damage Cause Estimation Using Multiple Images Based on Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

Cameras (Cameras B) whose intersection coordinates are inside the ball are treated as the images surrounding the image of interest. The other cameras (Cameras C) are considered to have little relevance to the image of interest and are not used in the subsequent analysis. In this study, for simplicity, the radius of this ball is assumed to be 1 m for determining the surrounding images.

In addition, datasets for VQA generally have multiple questions for a single image; Visual Question Answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is a widely used dataset for VQA, and an improved version of this dataset, Visual Question Answering v2.0 (VQA v2.0) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> with 265016 total images, is also available. Note that these datasets are constructed for general objects; therefore, it is difficult to utilize them directly in civil engineering fields such as bridge diagnostics.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As VQA is a task that has recently attracted attention with the development of deep leaning technology, deep-learning-based models have been mainly proposed. Most deep-learning-based models for VQA use CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> for processing images, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> for processing time series data, and Word2Vec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> for word embeddings. In practice, not simple RNNs but their derivatives long short-term memory (LSTM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and gated recurrent units (GRUs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> are often used.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are several models that do not use RNNs. Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> proposed a VQA model called iBOWIMG, which uses trained GoogLeNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> for image feature extraction and inputs questions as simple one-hot vectors to the model for feature extraction for each word. Ma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a VQA model composed entirely of CNNs. Their proposed model consists of an Image CNN for processing images, a Sentence CNN for processing vectorized questions, and a multimodal convolution layer for combining the output from both CNNs.</p>

In their model, the CNN-processed features on the image are first input to the LSTM, and then the words that make up the question are sequentially input to the LSTM. Malinowski et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> also proposed a VQA model consisting of a CNN and LSTM.

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">When using neural networks to handle sentences, simple RNN-based methods are limited in that accuracy deteriorates as the sentence length increases. Attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> has been proposed to focus on important parts by probabilistically weighting the input data. Attention mechanism has been extensively used in tasks such as sentence generation from images and machine translation. In recent years, attention mechanism has been widely used in image processing to improve accuracy by focusing on important parts of the input image. Many studies have been conducted in VQA to improve accuracy by focusing on important parts of input images and questions using the attention mechanism.</p>

In their model, features from the input sentence are selectively combined with features from the image in a region selection layer to determine which parts of the image to focus on. Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> proposed a VQA model using attention mechanism and LSTM. In their model, after a word is input to the LSTM, attention to the image is iteratively computed for each word. This attention region is determined by both the current word input to the model and the previous attention-weighted image. Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a co-attention model that performs attention not only to the image but also to the question text. In this model, an image representation is used to determine attention for the question text, and the question text representation is used to determine attention for the image.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As the co-attention model can consider the importance of each word compared to image-only attention, several co-attention-based VQA models have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. However, as attention is determined independently for each modality (image and question), simple co-attention models do not consider the dense interaction between each word in the question and each image region. For example, attention to each word in a question is determined from the entire input image and may focus on areas that are not inherently important. Therefore, a dense co-attention model has been proposed to establish the full interaction between each word in a question and each image region <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Compared to the co-attention model with coarse interaction, the dense co-attention model is more accurate. Another method that more accurately considers the interaction of each word with each image region is called bottom-up attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Bottom-up attention uses a pre-trained object detection model to detect each object in the image and uses the results to calculate attention, which can consider the dense interaction of each word with each image region. Yu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> proposed the bottom-up-attention-based Deep Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN). MCAN consists of multiple modular co-attention (MCA) layers consisting of self- and guided-attention units. The self- and guided-attention units are constructed using the multi-head attention proposed by Vaswani et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Models with bottom-up attention are known to be significantly more accurate than non-bottom-up attention models.</p>

Therefore, in this study, a VQA model for bridge images was constructed using MCAN. It is worth noting that, as new VQA models are proposed, if a more accurate model is available, it can be easily adopted in the proposed framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the images in the created dataset were extracted from actual bridge inspection reports at the Kanto Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism of Japan. However, bridge inspection reports are mainly composed of images taken of damaged areas; therefore, very few of these images do not show damage. By contrast, when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to capture images of actual bridges, it is expected that many undamaged images will be acquired. Therefore, in this study, in addition to the images extracted from bridge inspection reports, images extracted from videos of bridges taken by UAVs were added to the dataset. The number of images used to create the dataset was 442,035, consisting of 421,956 bridge inspection report images and 20,079 UAV-taken images.</p>

Therefore, in this study, for images extracted from bridge inspection reports, questions and answers were mechanically generated based on the names of members and damages described in the inspection reports along with the images. For the UAV-extracted images, the names of the members in the images and the presence or absence of damage in the members were determined manually, and the questions and answers were generated mechanically based on the results.</p>

The detection results show that ‘wall’, ‘rain’, and ‘graffiti’ were detected. As shown in the figure, the Faster R-CNN trained on the Visual Genome dataset does not directly correctly recognize objects in its object detection task. However, similar detection results in our dataset indicate the presence of similar members or damage. For example, if another image with water leaking or free lime is input, the same ‘rain’ or ‘graffiti’ detection results are expected. Therefore, by using the features obtained here as input for MCAN, VQA based on the features in each image region can be performed without creating a separate object detection dataset for bridge inspection.</p>

Then, based on the output damage name, a judgment is made regarding which member the damage is occurring in. Subsequently, based on the determined damage and member names, an analysis is performed to determine the damage cause that can be assumed in advance (Step 2). In this case, the surrounding images calculated via SfM are also used for analysis, as analysing the image of interest alone may miss information necessary for damage cause estimation. First, for the image to be analysed, it is determined if there are any members related to the assumed damage cause. If so, the system checks if there is an event that may have caused the damage to the member. In this way, the number of possible damage causes is analysed for each image. The above analysis is performed for all surrounding images, including the image of interest.</p>

<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Then, VQA was used to analyse the image of interest and the surrounding images to estimate the cause of damage. In this study, four causes of corrosion damage were assumed and estimated: 1. leaking from cracking on the slab, 2. leaking from the expansion joint, 3. leaking from the drainage pipe, and 4. leaking from cracking on the wheel guard.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In determining water leaking through cracking on the slab, ‘slab’ was set as a member related to the damage cause. The analysis was conducted assuming ‘cracking’ and ‘leaking’ as possible damage-causing events when a ‘slab’ exists. In determining leaking from the expansion joint, ‘abutment’ was set instead of expansion joint as the member related to the damage cause because the UAV could not approach the expansion joint in the range where the images were taken. This is valid because it is presumed that if there is leaking from the expansion joint, leaking can also be confirmed in the abutment directly below it. The analysis was conducted assuming ‘leaking’ as a possible damage-causing event when an ‘abutment’ exists. This allows the indirect determination of leaking from the expansion joint, despite the expansion joint not being photographed directly. In determining water leaking through the drainage pipe, ‘drainage pipe’ was set as a member related to the damage cause. The analysis was conducted assuming ‘corrosion’, ‘fissure’, ‘fracture’, and ‘leaking’ as possible damage-causing events when a ‘drainage pipe’ exists. Finally, in determining water leaking through cracking on the wheel guard, ‘wheel guard’ was set as a member related to the damage cause. The analysis was conducted assuming ‘leaking’ as a possible damage-causing event when a ‘wheel guard’ exists.</p>

The drainage pipe and wheel guard were not detected in any of the 64 images analysed in this study. Therefore, these were not considered to be the cause of damage in this case.

Therefore, by using the proposed method to analyse multiple images for damage cause estimation, it is possible to obtain results that cannot be obtained by analysing the image of interest alone. Moreover, as the VQA model accuracy is not perfect, diagnosis based on a single image alone may yield erroneous results. However, as demonstrated here, diagnosis based on the analysis results of multiple images can provide a more accurate diagnosis. In addition, when practicing engineers use the proposed method, it is expected to contribute to preventing overlooking the cause of damage by checking the related members that are estimated to have a high damage cause probability by referring to the analysis results.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a damage cause estimation method is proposed by calculating camera coordinates via SfM and extracting information from the images via VQA using multiple images taken around the damage region based on the calculated camera coordinates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In damage cause estimation, it is desirable to utilize not only a single image but also images of the surrounding conditions. Therefore, we first described a method for acquiring the image of interest and its surrounding images using SfM. Next, a VQA model was constructed using MCAN with a dataset specific to bridge members and damage information. The correct answer rate for questions requiring the member’s name and the damage’s name were 67.4% and 68.9%, respectively. The correct answer rate for questions requiring a yes/no answer was 99.1%. The overall correct answer rate for the test data was 81.2%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, a damage cause estimation method is proposed using the SfM results and VQA model. Based on the VQA model output results and the pre-assumed damage causes, we proposed an approach to narrow the damage causes by inputting new questions into the VQA model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed method was used to determine the damage and estimate its cause on a real bridge. In this study, corrosion in bridge members was taken as the damage to be determined and estimate its causes. As a result, it was concluded that corrosion was most likely caused by cracks on the slab or leakage from the expansion joint.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">When the proposed method is used by practicing engineers, it is expected to contribute to preventing overlooking the cause of damage by focusing on the related members that are estimated to have a high damage cause probability. In addition, for inexperienced engineers, it could also contribute to improve their maintenance skills, as they can learn where to focus in case of damage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the damage cause estimation accuracy, we could consider the severity of the damage, the relationship between the upper and lower positions of the damage, and weight the damage according to the distance between them. Further VQA model accuracy improvement is also important to improve the overall damage cause estimation accuracy.</p>
