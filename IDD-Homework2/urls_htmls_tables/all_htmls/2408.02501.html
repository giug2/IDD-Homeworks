<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has become a crucial research direction in future wireless communications due to its ubiquitous coverage, rapid and flexible deployment, and multi-layer cooperation capabilities. However, integrating hierarchical federated learning (HFL) with edge computing and SAGINs remains a complex open issue to be resolved. This paper proposes a novel framework for applying HFL in SAGINs, utilizing aerial platforms and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as edge servers and cloud servers, respectively, to provide multi-layer aggregation capabilities for HFL. The proposed system also considers the presence of inter-satellite links (ISLs), enabling satellites to exchange federated learning models with each other. Furthermore, we consider multiple different computational tasks that need to be completed within a limited satellite service time. To maximize the convergence performance of all tasks while ensuring fairness, we propose the use of the distributional soft-actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm to optimize resource allocation in the SAGIN and aggregation weights in HFL. Moreover, we address the efficiency issue of hybrid action spaces in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) through a decoupling and recoupling approach, and design a new dynamic adjusting reward function to ensure fairness among multiple tasks in federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm, consistently outperforming baseline approaches and offering a promising solution for addressing highly complex optimization problems in SAGINs.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advancement of wireless communications and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there has been a rapid increase in the demand for intelligent wireless networks in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Many intelligent applications in wireless networks are trained based on local data from wireless nodes, which are stored in a distributed manner across these nodes. In traditional centralized machine learning methods, it is necessary to transfer vast amounts of data to the cloud or data centers for processing, this approach not only consumes a significant amount of wireless bandwidth but also leads to considerable latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Moreover, data privacy and information security issues have become a major concern in the current digital era, because many applications involve the processing of sensitive personal information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To address the above issues, federated learning has emerged as a very popular machine learning framework in wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Within the federated learning framework, local devices in wireless networks train their models using their own local data, and only share their model parameters rather than their training data to protect data privacy. Furthermore, federated learning significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over wireless communications, thus saving wireless communication resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, satellite networks have attracted much attention in wireless communications due to their capability to provide global coverage and seamless connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In recent years, satellite network projects like Starlink <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, OneWeb <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and O3b <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have been rapidly advanced to provide global communication services, especially offering connections to remote areas. Thus, satellite communication has become an important component of future wireless communications. Furthermore, considering the strong demand for communication latency and rates in sixth-generation (6G) communications, the integration of satellite networks with terrestrial communication networks has emerged as a very promising design paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In particular, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) seamlessly integrate satellites, aerial platforms, and terrestrial communication nodes, where satellites provide ubiquitous communication connections globally, aerial platforms offer rapid and flexible edge access capabilities for terrestrial networks, and terrestrial networks provide localized communication connections as the communication backbone. This integrated Space-Air-Ground framework design offers unprecedented prospects for future communications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, edge computing was emerged to meet the growing demand for low-latency and high-bandwidth services by leveraging the computational and storage capabilities of terminal devices and edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In edge computing, computing tasks are transferred from terminals to edge servers to reduce service latency in the wireless network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, traditional edge computing requires the exchange of local data, occupying a large amount of communication bandwidth and raising issues of personal data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Hence, hierarchical federated learning (HFL) was developed to address these issues via combining federated learning and edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In HFL, models from terminals are aggregated multiple times at edge servers before being aggregated in the cloud server to efficiently utilize edge network resource while protecting data privacy. Furthermore, the hierarchical training process in HFL naturally aligns with the multi-level communication architecture of SAGINs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The global coverage capability and flexible aerial deployment of SAGINs enable more ground users to participate in HFL to significantly increase the diversity and performance of task training.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is emerging as a paradigm for providing artificial intelligence services in wireless communications, and numerous current studies have investigated its performance within wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

A distributed resource allocation method was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to minimize the energy consumption and latency of federated learning in transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the delay performance was analyzed to improve the federated learning performance and the energy efficiency in wireless vehicular networks. To reduce the convergence time of federated learning in wireless communications, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> analyzed the effect of quantization errors and limited wireless resources in federated learning and proposed a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the local model quantization and the number of local users in federate learning.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the outage performance of the relaying scenario was analyzed with a closed form for SAGIN. To strike the balance between computational resource consumption and communication resource consumption, a heuristic greedy algorithm was proposed to design the virtual network functions and data routing in SAGINs. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a queuing game model based method was introduced to enhance the network throughput and reduce the service delay in SAGINs. To minimize the energy consumption and latency for cloud and edge computing in SAGINs, a decision-assisted reinforcement learning algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to optimize the resource allocation. Considering a SAGIN’s global coverage capability and rapid dynamic deployment, it enables a more flexible participation of ground users in federated learning tasks, thus federated learning within SAGIN has been extensively researched in recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, a novel topology-aware framework was designed to speed up the convergence for federated learning in SAGINs. To jointly consider the requirements of adaptivity, communication efficiency and model security in federated learning, a tensor-empowered federated learning framework was proposed to meet these three requirements in SAGINs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The existing research on federated learning within SAGINs has focused on two-layer federated learning architectures, failing to fully leverage the potential performance capabilities of nodes within the SAGIN framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the conventional two-layer federated learning framework design often fails to meet the demands in scenarios with dispersed user locations and unstable communication channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the integration of federated learning with network edges in recent years enables low-latency edge intelligence at the data generation source. Therefore, multi-layer HFL with network edges has emerged as a highly promising research direction in wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a semi-decentralized framework was proposed to utilize the edge servers to enhance the convergence performance of federated learning. To improve the convergence performance and reduce the round delay in federated learning, a hierarchical aggregation strategy was proposed to optimize the edge server scheduling and bandwidth allocation in wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm was utilized to optimize the resource allocation strategy for fast convergence of federated learning in wireless communications. However, two significant challenges remain in the existing works: Firstly, the deployment of HFL utilizing space, air, and ground nodes within SAGINs as edge and cloud servers remains an area that has not been investigated. Secondly, while existing federated learning research has explored personalized multi-task learning with non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, achieving balance in the convergence performance of multiple completely unrelated tasks which are repeatedly distributed in multiple users within constrained timeframes, such as the service times of SAGIN environments, continues to be an unaddressed issue.</p>

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the integration of HFL in SAGINs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, we address a research gap as the existing works have not considered the utilization of the HFL framework in SAGIN to leverage the performance of various nodes and balance the convergence performance of different tasks within a limited satellite service time. Our study also encompasses the investigation of the impact of dynamic deployment and user association within SAGIN on HFL. To optimize the communication rounds within HFL and balance the final convergence performance of different tasks, dynamic planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), user association, access between satellites and UAVs, the numbers of local convergence iterations and the weights of models in aggregations are crucial for HFL in SAGINs. However, traditional algorithms struggle to adapt to dynamically changing communication environments. Thus, we propose a hybrid action space DRL-based algorithm to address this challenge. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p>

However, due to the potential long distances between ground users, direct communication between them may not be feasible. Similarly, UAVs which provide services for ground users might not be able to communicate directly with each other. Furthermore, we consider that satellites are constantly in high-speed motion, thus the communication window between UAVs and LEO satellites is limited in time.</p>

In this work, considering the spacing between LEO satellites, there are differences in the remaining service time between each LEO satellite and the same UAV at the beginning. Moreover, due to the negligible altitude of the UAV compared to the altitude of LEO satellites and the radius of the Earth, we assume the altitude of the UAVs can be disregarded in the computation of LEO coverage time window.</p>

Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple tasks in federated learning, the number of training iterations experienced by the models uploaded by each ground user during each edge aggregation stage may vary. Moreover, considering the non-i.i.d. distribution of local datasets in a specific task, ground user’s local datasets have different impact on the aggregated model. Therefore, the weight of local models in the aggregation is crucial to the result, and relying on traditional federated learning aggregation algorithms such as FedAvg’s weighted average aggregation method can not fully optimize the model in SAGIN.</p>

Similar to the edge aggregation phase, the transmission rate between the air and space layer also varies due to the high-speed motion of satellites. Moreover, the model upload between UAVs and LEO satellites presents similar challenges as the previous phase, such as non-i.i.d. data distribution from ground users, different training iterations among different ground users, and differing aggregation iterations among different edge servers (UAVs).</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After an LEO satellite has aggregated all the models as the global model for a given task, it needs to broadcast the global model back to ground users. Considering the service time constraints of LEO satellites, an LEO with the global model may not be able to access all UAVs directly. In such cases, the global model may need to be transmitted to other satellites via ISLs and then relayed to corresponding UAVs. Subsequently, the UAVs transmit the global models to ground users within their coverage areas. Ground users continue to repeat the above steps after updating their local models by using the received global model until final convergence.</p>

<div id="S2.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our objective is to maximize the average performance (e.g. minimizing the loss in classification tasks) of all tasks while ensuring fairness among different tasks, i.e., reducing the discrepancy in performance across tasks. In the proposed SAGIN, each ground user is allocated in a cluster and may participate in one or more or even all tasks, while the service time of satellites is limited. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the wireless communication environment such as channel fading, affects the speed of model uploads and downloads. Therefore, it is necessary to plan the UAV trajectories to counteract the effects of channel fading and to optimize the clustering between ground users and UAVs. This strategy aims to enhance the communication efficiency between the ground layer and the aerial layer for the proposed HFL system.</p>

<div id="S2.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, UAVs can select whether all users within their cluster area participate in ground-aerial communications based on the progress of task training (fewer users can reduce interference). For example, if considerable progress is made in training a task, UAVs can prioritize communication with users associated with other tasks. Similarly, satellites can choose whether to access UAVs within their coverage area based on the progress of task training, considering that the data distribution of user groups served by different UAVs is uneven.</p>

<div id="S2.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the ISLs between satellites create a collaborative network for SAGINs. However, the selection of the LEO satellite for uploading models from UAVs and the selection of the final aggregation node between satellites also affects the total training rounds. Besides, within the limited satellite service time, multiple rounds of global aggregation need to be performed for each task, inevitably resulting in some satellites being unable to cover UAVs in the later stages. Therefore, selecting the final aggregation satellite node and utilizing ISL to reduce communication time and improve aggregation efficiency are crucial for HFL in SAGINs.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For the downlink transmission in the global update stage, the pairing issue between LEO satellites and UAVs also exists due to the variations in service time and rate caused by the high mobility of satellites. Furthermore, the trajectory of UAVs affects the efficiency of broadcasting the global model to ground users within their service clusters. Therefore, the pairing issue and the UAV trajectories are also crucial for the communication efficiency during the broadcasting stage.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p5.15" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to fairly maximize the performance of all tasks within the limited service time of the LEO satellites, we need to optimize: 1) the trajectory of each UAV; 2) the pairing between UAVs and users (uplink); 3) the pairing between UAVs and satellites (uplink); 4) the selection of the final aggregation satellite, 5) the pairing between satellites and UAVs (downlink); 6) the weights for edge aggregation on UAVs; 7) the weights for cloud aggregation on satellites; and 8) the weights for final aggregation.

<p id="S2.SS5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The above optimization problem includes eight variables, comprising both continuous and discrete variables, and some optimization variables are interdependent (e.g., the UAV’s trajectory and the UAV-ground user pairing). Thus, it is clear that this is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem and is highly complex. Considering that our proposed system involves multi-round hierarchical aggregation in federated learning, it also represents a long-term planning problem. Traditional algorithms wouldn’t be efficient in addressing this problem, and real-time computational complexity is a critical concern in dynamic wireless communication scenarios. To tackle this issue we employ a DRL algorithm which is well-suited for this kind of optimization problem and exhibits low computational complexity after deployment. Moreover, we explore a hybrid action space framework to enhance the DRL performance and consider the fairness among different tasks in reward design.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed problem in this work is a long-term optimization problem which can be effectively addressed by using DRL. However, the presence of several continuous and discrete optimization variables in the optimization problem makes DRL optimization difficult to converge. Some existing approaches tried to tackle this issue of DRL by discretizing or continuousizing all optimization variables. However, these methods sacrifice a portion of the optimization space, reducing the system’s controllability, and may lead to challenges in exploring the huge action space when exploring different possibilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we employ a decoupling approach to separate the hybrid optimization variables and assign them to different agents within DRL for learning. Subsequently, to efficiently combine the optimization results from different agents, we utilize a maximum posteriori policy based algorithm to mix the discretized and continuous variables after optimization, providing an effective solution to the proposed optimization problem. Furthermore, considering the fairness among different tasks, we design a fair and effective reward scheme to ensure that each task achieves satisfactory training results.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The designed reward function can be divided into two parts. At the beginning of the federated learning training process, it’s not feasible to achieve balance among all tasks when the proposed system starts operating. Therefore, the focus is more on optimizing the performance of all tasks. As time progresses, the emphasis of rewards gradually shifts towards the second part of the reward function. The designed reward bias ensures that tasks deviating too much from the performance mean receive certain penalties, while those approaching the performance mean contribute significantly to rewards. Thus, the designed reward function dynamically adjusts the reward values based on task performance and runtime, ensuring fairness among tasks while optimizing the performance of all tasks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS2.p1.34" class="ltx_p">Existing research in reinforcement learning has started to shift towards distributional algorithm studies because distributional DRL can estimate the entire distribution of total returns rather than just the expected distribution. This is highly beneficial for the convergence of long-term rewards. However, the relationship between learning the return distribution and predicting values has not been discussed in traditional distributional DRL. Therefore, we introduce the DSAC algorithm which reduces the impact of overestimation by learning the distribution function of state–action returns. Firstly, the algorithm introduces the distributional idea into SAC, the return for state-action pairs in SAC can be represented as:</p>

Whether discretize or make all actions continuous, it leads to a decrease in system control capability and loss of optimization performance. Therefore, we introduce a decoupling strategy to decompose discrete and continuous actions in the optimization variables. Actions and policies are re-expressed as</p>

Therefore, we employed a decoupling strategy to allocate the coupled optimization variables to different agents, and then coupled the optimized action spaces to form a hybrid solution. The proposed decoupling algorithm re-couples the variables after decoupling, providing DRL with stronger capabilities to explore the relationship between actions and states. Moreover, it is noticed that the prediction complexity in DRL is substantially lower than the training complexity. Once deployed, the pre-trained DRL model can make real-time decisions with very small computational overhead. The structure of the hybrid action space in DSAC method is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ III-3 Hybrid Action Space in DSAC ‣ III Hybrid Action Space DRL Algorithm with Fairness Reward Function ‣ Fair Resource Allocation For Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks via Deep Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid Control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.

As we can see in this figure, the average performance of tasks rises with an increase in the time. As the service time progresses, tasks continue to be trained in HFL which leads to the increase of accuracy. H-DSAC achieves the average test accuracy of 91.4% when the communication time is 100 s, while the others achieve 90.4%, 85.6%, 84.9% and 81.9%, respectively. The proposed algorithm consistently outperforms all other algorithms, thus demonstrating the superiority of the H-DSAC algorithm. The performance of ‘H-DSAC + FedAvg’ consistently ranks the second, indicating that the gain from the hybrid action space method is higher than the gain from aggregation weights in the proposed optimization problem. Compared to other algorithms, the performance of ‘H-DSAC + HoveringUAV’ significantly deteriorates with the absence of UAV trajectory planning. Therefore, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability of ground-air links. In addition, MPPO and PDQN achieve similar performance across various scenarios, this result indicates that while MPPO may offer algorithmic superiority over DQN and DDPG, PDQN also possesses its own advantages in optimizing hybrid spaces.</p>

As the average loss decreases continuously, the average accuracy increases correspondingly. H-DSAC achieves the average loss of 0.32 when the communication time is 40 s, while the others achieve 0.37, 0.88, 0.71 and 0.74, respectively.

Besides, when we utilize the proposed reward function, the average accuracy is higher than that with fixed reward. This result underscores the beneficial role of the proposed reward mechanism for ensuring fairness among multiple tasks. If the satellite cannot guarantee that all tasks converge to a high accuracy threshold due to limited access time, the algorithm’s dynamic design will ensure that all tasks fairly converge to the best possible value within the given time duration.</p>

It can be observed that the average test accuracy of tasks increases as the ground user power rises. This is because higher ground user transmission power can provide higher ground-to-air data rates, thereby reducing model transmission time and accelerating aggregation speed, allowing for more aggregation cycles within the limited satellite service time. Moreover, the proposed H-DSAC algorithm achieves around 97.99% accuracy when the transmit power is 0.2 W for all ground users, while the other three benchmarks only achieve 96.4%, 94.1% and 94.2%, respectively. This result demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the benchmarks.</p>

From this figure, it can be seen that as the number of tasks increases, the average performance tends to deteriorate. This is because different tasks may originate from entirely different datasets, and an increase in the number of tasks inevitably leads to tighter constraints on transmission and computational resources. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms other benchmarks, H-DSAC achieves 96.9% with 8 tasks, while others achieve between 91.7% and 95.2%.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel application of the HFL framework within SAGIN, utilizing aerial platforms and LEO satellites as edge and cloud servers for HFL, respectively. We also considered ISLs as communication channels between satellites to further provide training resources for federated learning tasks. To maximize the average performance of multiple distinct tasks and ensure fairness among them during training, we employed a decoupling-coupling approach in the DSAC algorithm and designed a novel dynamically changing reward function to guarantee fairness among multiple tasks. By optimizing ground-to-air pairings in uplink and downlink transmissions, air-to-satellite pairings, aerial UAV trajectory planning, final aggregation selection between satellites, edge aggregation weights, cloud aggregation weights, and final aggregation weights, we balanced the training effects among different tasks to ensure that the performance of any individual task can converge to a high level while maximizing the overall performance. Through simulations, we validated the superiority of the proposed algorithm and emphasized the importance of fairness design during task training. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of user transmit power, UAV trajectory planning and minimum coverage elevation angle on the results and demonstrated the significance of resource allocation in SAGINs for federated learning training performance. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of data distribution in tasks on algorithm convergence, the results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong adaptability to dynamic environments and provides a highly promising optimization tool for future federated learning frameworks and multi-access edge computing systems in SAGINs. In our future work, we will consider the adaptive downlink/uplink bandwidth allocation and full-duplex mode to further enhance the efficiency of federated learning in SAGINs.</p>
