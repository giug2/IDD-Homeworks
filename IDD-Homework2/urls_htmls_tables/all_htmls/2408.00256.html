<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning approach, that protects the privacy of each vehicle by allowing the model to be trained on multiple devices simultaneously without the need to upload all data to a road side unit (RSU). This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or widely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the labeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are not suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular networks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges constantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way for training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity, owing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of the aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper proposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called FLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for self-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of Internet of Things (IoT) makes many practical applications available to people, such as automatic navigation, weather forecast and self-driving systems, which not only reduces the probability of accidents, but also improves the happiness of life <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Training a good model can make the practical application more robust, which requires a lot of data. Moving vehicles can constantly collect new data by their devices, most of which can be captured in the form of images via camera mounted on the roof of the vehicle. Compared with the traditional method of collecting image data with onboard radar, this way greatly reduces the cost and technical requirements, making the shift of image collection paradigm to vision-based measurement (VBM) has broad promising <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">After the acquisition is completed, the vehicle process the image data to realize image recognition and classification. It provides the necessary information for self-driving and driver assistance systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and helps drivers perceive and understand their surroundings. Especially in nighttime or bad weather conditions, image recognition and classification models can be critical valuable in identifying road signs, other vehicles, and obstacles, providing specific object classification, improving driver visibility, and improving driving safety. Therefore, image recognition and classification in self-driving plays a key role in reducing the risk of traffic accidents and improving road safety.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned earlier, training a robust model requires a lot of data. However, the data stored locally on each vehicle may be private and sensitive, and drivers are reluctant to share it with each other in order to protect their privacy. If the vehicles do not share information, they can only train the local model using their own data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Due to the single driving environment, the image categories will be skewed, so that the trained model does not have good transference. Compared to single vehicle training, FL can solve this issue by aggregating different vehicles’ local trained models with local data. This approach can take a large data set into account in the training process without the need for vehicles to share local data, resulting in superior performance and enhanced generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, this approach still faces the following two issues: low image quality and missing or incorrect labels. The first one is due to the motion blur caused by the movement of vehicles, and the other is because of the high cost and incorrectness of labeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In a vehicular network, a high velocity usually leads to insufficient exposure time for the camera sensor, causing motion blur. In this paper, we consider the motion blur caused by different vehicle velocities in the training process, and adjust corresponding weights of the model parameters for FL model aggregation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the emergence of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN), has facilitated significant advances in computer vision benchmarks. Self-supervised learning is a special form of unsupervised learning, and its main feature is that it uses information inherent in the data itself to help machine learning models get a better representation, thereby improving performance across a variety of tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Until now, research on unsupervised learning has focused on mining shared features between pre-trained tasks and downstream tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> introduced noise contrast estimation (NCE) loss as an objective function to distinguish between different instances. Each image was treated as a positive sample and the others as negative samples, effectively treating each image as a category, constituting an instance-level classification task. SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> has maximized the sample characteristics of similarity to study representations. It abandoned the memory library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and generated more negative samples by increasing the batch size. The core idea of these methods is to encourage models to place similar data representations(positive sample pairs) together in the embedding space, while separating dissimilar representations(negative sample pairs) to learn feature extraction.
Since these methods do not consider the fact that the distance between samples of the same category should be smaller than that of different categories’ samples, but treat all pairs equally. In this way, a large number of negative samples are required. It will pose significant challenges to storage and computing power in the vehicle environment, increasing the requirements of hardware configuration levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">MoCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, as a self-supervised learning method for CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, has made an important contribution by introducing queue and momentum updating techniques to create a large and consistent dictionary conducive to contrast learning. It replaced the original memory library with a queue as an additional data structure to store these negative samples. Momentum encoder <math id="S2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> is used to replace the original loss constraint term. The key advantage of the MoCo family is the use of the queue as negative samples and the momentum update of the queue, which greatly reduces the need for vehicle storage capacity and computing power in local training. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> used MoCo for the pre-training model weights on ImageNet and achieves excellent results in downstream fine-tuning tasks. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> employed MoCo for unsupervised learning with large amounts of unlabeled data on remote servers. The local vehicles downloaded the trained model and used it as the initialization model.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These methods are characterized by the presence of a large default datasets that can be used for unsupervised learning, and the recognition accuracy increases with the expansion of the dictionary size<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Simultaneously, as the dictionary size increases, the recognition accuracy gradually improves. However, it is important to note that, larger dictionaries also requires larger memory size, increasing the storage cost and the computing capability of hardness. SimCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> attributed the need for a large dictionary in MoCo to hardness awareness between anchors, and the author believed that the consistency between positive and negative keys was more crucial than that between negative keys. Therefore, it utilized dual temperatures to differentiate inter-anchor samples and intra-anchor samples, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Review of related works ‣ Mobility-Aware Federated Self-supervised Learning in Vehicular Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which eliminates the need for a dictionary of negative samples.</p>

<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we will train the local model on the vehicles side by self-supervised learning with dual temperatures. After the training is completed, only the local models of vehicles are uploaded, and then the received local model is aggregated in RSU by FL, which not only protects the privacy of vehicles, but also produces a model with better transform through distributed training. At the same time, considering that the images collected in the actual vehicle environment may be blur, the blur level is used as the weight during aggregation, which makes the aggregated model more reliable and stable.</p>

Each vehicle driving straightly when cross the intersection. We firstly build a truncated Gaussian distribution model as the mobility model for each vehicle. At the same time, each vehicle is equipped with a large mount of images, called local data, captured by camera mounted in the roof before entering the coverage of the RSU. It is worth noting that vehicles coming from different directions may capture different categories of images from each other.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning requires a large amount of unlabeled data. In the vehicle scene, it is easy for the vehicles to collect enough image data during driving. However, due to the limitations of the environment, storage and camera perspective, the categories of image data of each vehicle are limited, which may not meet the IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> requirement. To be specific, when the vehicle uses the image data stored by itself for local training, a model shewed to its own image categories is obtained, namely a model with poor generation. After the training is completed, the vehicle uploads the parameters of local model, and the RSU aggregates the received local model parameters from different vehicles, making the aggregated model more general and effectively solving the data non-IID problem.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the results of baseline1 and baseline2, it is obvious that it is not beneficial to drop the model trained with motion blurred images(baseline2). Because it drops some models during the aggregation process, baseline2 has the lowest number of models used in the global training. This suggests that the number of models involved in aggregation is more critical than the quality of the models. Finally, our proposed aggregation method assigns smaller weights to models trained by faster vehicles. It can be seen that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the fluctuation of the loss function, while facilitating the loss function and converge to a smaller value faster. This demonstrated that proposed approach can reduce the effect of image blur and also increase the global model training speed.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a FLSimCo algorithm. First, on the basis of self-supervised learning, the advantages of FL are used. The main goal is to solve the problem of data category skew and to train a model with well generation without sharing private data. By integrating self-supervised learning and FL, the algorithm can improve the model’s adaptability to data heterogeneity to achieve a more robust pre-training model. More importantly, considering the data blur caused by vehicle movement, the blur level is used as the weight of federated aggregation, which makes the algorithm more suitable for real scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the FLSimCo algorithm ensures the protection of vehicle privacy, and requires no labeled image data, while addressing the aggregation challenges in vehicular environments characterized by significant data shew and image blurring due to vehicle movement.</p>
