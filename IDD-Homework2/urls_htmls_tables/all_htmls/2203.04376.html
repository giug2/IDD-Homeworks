<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) is a promising distributed learning technique that aims to train a shared global model while reducing communication costs and promoting users’ privacy. However, the training process might significantly occupy a long time due to the nature of the used data for training, which leads to higher energy consumption and therefore impacts the model convergence. To tackle this issue, we propose a data-driven federated edge learning scheme that tends to select suitable participating nodes based on quality data and energy. First, we design an unsupervised data-aware splitting scheme that partitions the node’s local data into diverse samples used for training. We incorporate a similarity index to select quality data that enhances the training performance. Then, we propose a heuristic participating nodes selection scheme to minimize the communication and computation energy consumption, as well as the amount of communication rounds. The obtained results show that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the vanilla FEEL in terms of energy consumption and the number of communication rounds.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, the world is witnessing a substantial development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which is sweeping major fields. This development is made because of the tremendous advances in machine learning (ML) techniques. Novel ML applications emerge every day, ranging from autonomous driving and finance to marketing and healthcare, potential applications are boundless <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In parallel, wireless mobile technologies, such as the fifth-generation (5G), promise to connect billions of heterogeneous devices to the network edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This connection opens various opportunities to verticals toward the rise of new applications and business models under the banner of the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Edge nodes seek to collect a massive amount of data and open new avenues for ML applications. The prevalent approach of ML implementations on edge devices is to amass all the relevant data at cloud/edge servers and train powerful ML models using the available data and processing capacities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, such a centralized fashion is not fitting many use cases’ requirements, which might also violate the latency requirements of the underlying application, scatter communication resources, and infringe user/data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
For example, an autonomous car may generate from 5 to 20 TB of data per day. This large volume of data contains sensitive information and needs to be transmitted over the bottleneck core network to be processed at distant cloud servers. The low-latency requirements, information density, and data privacy become challenging to be addressed in such circumstances.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To fulfill the requirements of most IoT applications and promote data privacy, federated edge learning (FEEL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has been proposed an advanced machine learning technique to train models in a distributed fashion, using mobile edge computing. In FEEL,

</span>
The process is repeated multiple rounds or until the model reaches a pre-defined threshold.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For each training round, the edge node performs local computation for model training as well as communication with the edge server for model updating. Multiple communication and computation rounds significantly drain the energy of devices that are energy-constrained in nature, and hence restrict their ability to conduct more training rounds. This circumstance negatively impacts the training performance and consequently leads to a slower convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
An efficient way to overcome this issue is to reduce the number of training rounds, which reflects to decreasing the computation and communication overhead, and hence, sustain the node’s energy. Using fewer data samples for training can help in reaching less communication overhead. Yet, this is a double-edged problem since the model might not converge with fewer data and the accuracy is controversial.
Notwithstanding, work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> reveals that the model convergence is highly relying on the quality of data used during the training. ML models can be trained with fewer data samples, as long as this data has high quality (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> variety). Determining the data used in the model training can substantially improve the training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, in this paper, we design a data-driven federated edge learning scheme for IoT networks. Instead of using the entire dataset for training, edge nodes split their data into a set of sub-datasets by minimizing the data similarity (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> increase the diversity within each sub-dataset). This approach is motivated by the fact that less yet quality data samples significantly contribute to model learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Thereafter, the edge server selects a subset of nodes to participate in the training based on their similarity score and communication/computation energy.

For instance, edge computing strengthens from the intelligent decisions made by AI mechanisms, while AI models will be further improved by availing the distributed nature of edge computing. Yet, the edge server requires to collect all data generated by users for training and inference purposes, which might violate the user’s privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

In FEEL, multiple edge devices collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data. The process is orchestrated by a centralized edge server that sends the model to multiple nodes. Each node trains the model locally using its own data and sends the model parameters to the server for aggregation. The model is refined and updated for multiple rounds until its convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
There have been various efforts in the literature that tend to enhance network resources while ensuring fast model convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For instance,
authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose a client selection scheme for federated learning, taking into account the nature of heterogeneous mobile devices. The edge server sets a deadline to be met by clients, which includes model download, train, update, and upload. The edge server, based on the clients’ resources, selects which nodes can participate in the learning phase and hence lower the training time.
Mohammed <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> tend to minimize the number of IoT candidates contributing to the training process. Inspired by the solution of the secretary problem, the authors design an online heuristic scheme to find the best candidate clients. The objective is to overcome communication and computation constraints while ensuring a predefined accuracy.
Albaseer <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> propose a client selection approach that leverages devices’ heterogeneity. The approach aims to accelerate the convergence rate by using clients’ round latency and exploiting the bandwidth reuse for clients that consume more time to update the model. The server performs model averaging and then clusters the clients based on a predefined threshold. Clients with less latency are selected to update the model.
Works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> propose a data exclusion approach to minimize energy consumption during federated learning rounds. Toward this, the authors design a customized local training algorithm that selects only the samples that improve the model’s quality based on a predefined threshold probability.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the aforementioned solutions have contributed to enhancing federated learning architecture, some of them did not consider the data in their studies. Indeed, data is a pillar component when selecting participating clients since it has a direct impact on model accuracy.

Constraint (<a href="#S3.E15.1" title="In 15 ‣ III-B Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model &amp; Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Data Splitting Scheme for Federated Edge Learning in IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15a</span></a>) imposes that the computation and computation should be accomplished before the fixed deadline by the edge server.
Similarly, constraint (<a href="#S3.E15.2" title="In 15 ‣ III-B Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model &amp; Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Data Splitting Scheme for Federated Edge Learning in IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15b</span></a>) enforces that computation and transmission energy should not exceed the node available energy. This constraint helps in ensuring that the selected node is able to provide training and successfully send the update to the edge service without its power running off.
Finally, constraint (<a href="#S3.E15.3" title="In 15 ‣ III-B Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model &amp; Problem Formulation ‣ Unsupervised Data Splitting Scheme for Federated Edge Learning in IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15c</span></a>) expresses the non-negativity.</p>

The unsupervised data-aware splitting scheme runs at the edge device and enables the node to split its local dataset into a set of sub-dataset that include quality samples by maximizing the data diversity. The node selection scheme, on the other hand, is executed at the edge server to select participating nodes, that own quality data, in the training phase with minimum energy consumption. The joint goal is to significantly enhance the global model training and improve the overall network performance.</p>

The loss function used is Mean Squared Error. We can see that the proposed scheme is not affected by reducing the number of participating nodes or the number of samples used in the learning. Indeed, the obtained accuracy and loss are better than the vanilla FEEL and the random scheme. With a fewer number of participating nodes and a small size of data, the proposed scheme was able to converge quickly.</p>

We can observe that the proposed scheme shows a significant reduction in energy consumption compared with vanilla FEEL and random node selection scheme. The reduction gain is proportional to the number of training rounds. This is due to the fact that the proposed scheme selects a minimum number of nodes to participate in the training with diverse and quality data samples. The diversity helps in fast model convergence with fewer data and training rounds. Both vanilla FEEL and random schemes need to incorporate the entire dataset that requires more time for training, computation, and communication and by consequence more energy consumption.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we designed a data-driven federated edge learning scheme for IoT networks. Our design goal is to enhance the model convergence with the minimum energy consumption. In doing so, we proposed an unsupervised data-splitting scheme that partitions the node’s local data into diverse and quality sub-datasets to be used in the training. We applied the Jaccard index to ensure the diversity of data samples. We also proposed a heuristic node selection scheme to select participating nodes with minimum energy consumption. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of model convergence and energy consumption. As a future step, we will focus on designing a distributed data-aware exclusion and node scheduling architecture for federated learning.</p>
