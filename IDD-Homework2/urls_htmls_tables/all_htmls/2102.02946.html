<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) as a promising edge-learning framework can effectively address the latency and privacy issues by featuring distributed learning at the devices and model aggregation in the central server. In order to enable efficient wireless data aggregation, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently been proposed and attracted immediate attention. However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an AirComp-based FL scheme. To combat this effect, the concept of dynamic learning rate (DLR) is proposed in this work. We begin our discussion by considering multiple-input-single-output (MISO) scenario, since the underlying optimization problem is convex and has closed-form solution. We then extend our studies to more general multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) case and an iterative method is derived. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing the aggregate distortion and guaranteeing the testing accuracy using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. In addition, we present the asymptotic analysis and give a near-optimal receive beamforming design solution in closed form, which is verified by numerical simulations.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Future sixth-generation (6G) communication networks are envisioned to undergo a profound transformation, which evolves from <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">connected

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which allows automatic analysis of a large mass of data generated in wireless networks and subsequent optimization of highly dynamic and complex network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, will shape the landscape of 6G. Conversely, 6G will give renewed impetus to the AI-empowered mobile applications by supplying the advanced wireless communications and mobile computing technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> as supporting infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">AI tasks entail increasingly intensive computation workloads. Hence, they are generally migrated to and trained on the server center with sufficient computation resources and the availability of data that is first collected from the devices/sensors and then uploaded to the center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The data volume can be considerably
large and, thus, imposing heavy transmission traffic burden and increasing
the latency. Another critical problem comes from the serious concern of privacy leakage, since the generated data, e.g., photos,
social-networking records, at the devices are often privacy sensitive.
An intuitive way to counteract the above issues would be to conduct
training and inference process directly at the network edge, such
as devices and sensors, using locally generated real-time data. The
paradigm edge learning has unique advantages
of balanced resource support, proximity to data sources compared with
cloud learning and higher learning accuracy compared to on-device
learning by harnessing the computation and storage capacities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) tackles the aforementioned concerns by collaboratively
training a shared global model with locally stored data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
A typical FL algorithm alternates between two iterative phases: (I) The devices
receive the global model from the edge server and train local models
with locally stored data; (II) These local models are transmitted
to and aggregated at the edge server to yield the global model. Note
that the data volume of the local models (may consist of millions
of parameters) are much smaller than the raw data. Nonetheless, the
local models uploaded by legion of participating devices via wireless
links is resource-demanding, which is the main bottleneck
to implement FL in practice. In this regard, developing communication-efficient
methods are of paramount importance. Some recent works have considered
asynchronous mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>,
sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and aggregate frequency
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to reduce the transmission overhead, which, however,
ignore the aspects of physical and network layers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the second phase of FL, the edge server averages the local model parameters from the distributed devices, which is essentially wireless data aggregation. Conventional multiple-access schemes, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
(OFDM), are based on the separated-communication-and-computing principle.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a time-division multiple access (TDMA) system was
considered, where a joint batchsize selection and communication resource
allocation scheme was developed aiming at accelerating the training
process and improving the learning efficiency. The impact of three
different scheduling policies on the FL performance were analytically
studied in the large-scale wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Such
sub-optimal communication-and-computation approaches could result
in a sharp rise in consumption of wireless resources as well as congesting
the air-interface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Very Recently, the over-the-air computation (AirComp) scheme was proposed by leveraging the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels, which is fundamentally different from the traditional separated-communication-and-computing principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. By aggregating the data simultaneously received from distributed devices in an analog manner, the AirComp technique can further improve communication efficiency
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The AirComp technique has recently been applied to implementing FL. Specifically, a gradient sparsification and random linear projection based approach is proposed and the reduced data was transmitted via AirComp to address the bandwidth and power limitations, which outperformed its digital
counterpart <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. As a matter of fact, the distortions caused
by fading and noisy channels are critical for learning tasks as a
large aggregation error may lead to the degradation of inference accuracy.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the transmission power was designed by truncated
channel inversion, and two scheduling schemes were proposed to guarantee
the identical amplitudes of the received signals among devices in
a single-input-single-output (SISO) system to reduce the aggregate
error. Meanwhile in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, joint device selection and receive beamforming design was investigated in single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) configuration, and a novel unified difference-of-convex (DC) function was proposed. On the other hand, the problem of distortion minimization in an intelligent reflection surface (IRS)-aided cloud radio access network (CRAN) system was addressed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, where a joint optimization scheme of the passive beamforming and linear detection vector was designed. Furthermore, with the aid of multi-IRS, a novel resource and device selection method was developed to minimize the aggregate error as
well as maximize the selected devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The existing
works utilized wireless resources, such as power control, device selection
and beamforming design, as well as channel configuration to align
the received signals from distributed devices. Nevertheless, they did not fully unleash
the potential of hyper-parameters in the perspective of machine learning
(ML).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Learning rate is a key hyper-parameter that determines the convergence
and the convergence rate of the learning tasks. A large learning rate will hinder convergence and cause loss function around the minimum or even to diverge, while
too small a learning rate will lead to slow convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. To select an optimal learning rate is always critical, yet tricky issue for learning algorithms to work properly. One feasible approach is to adopt learning rate schedulers, which is able to adjust the learning rate
training online. However, it has to be designed in advance and is unable
to adapt to the characteristics of the dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Adaptive learning rates such as Adagrad can adapt to the data and change with the gradients, which are most widely used in deep learning community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Later, cyclical learning rate (CLR) was proposed to allow the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values, which incurs less computational cost and can significantly enhance the learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The essence behind CLR originates from the observation that increasing
the learning rate allows more rapid traversal of saddle point plateaus
and thus achieves a longer term beneficial effect. Inspired by this study,
we propose dynamic learning rate (DLR) between the minimum and maximum
boundaries to adapt to the fading channels, in order to further reduce
the aggregate error caused by the fading and noisy channels.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider FL for AI-empowered mobile applications,
such as e-health services, which will be supported by 6G networks.
Instead of adopting conventional separated-communication-and-computation
pattern, we incorporate AirComp to aggregate local models from distributed
devices so as to improve the communication efficiency. In AirComp-based schemes, minimizing the resultant aggregate distortion is of paramount
importance as a large distortion can spawn performance degradation
of AI tasks. To mitigate the wireless distortion measured by mean
square error (MSE), we first propose to utilize a DLR scheme to adapt
to the wireless channels, and receive beamforming
optimization is jointly considered. The technical contributions of this work are summarized below.</p>

Though appears different at first glance, these approaches share a common aim, which is to align the receive signals and minimize the noise-induced error. Whereas in this work, we take a radically different perspective and propose to mitigate the distortions by optimizing the hyper-parameters in the learning process. Concretely, a strategy is designed to let the local learning rate <span id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath"><math id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">μ</mi><mi id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜇</ci><ci id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.m1.1c">\mu_{k}</annotation></semantics></math></span> adapt to the time-varying wireless environment.

The DLR-based scheme is shown to have slight higher test accuracy on both datasets compared to conventional methods using a fixed learning rate, i.e., <math id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="r_{\mathrm{min}}=r_{\mathrm{max}}=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.2.cmml">r</mi><mi id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.3" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.3.cmml">min</mi></msub><mo id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.3" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.3.cmml">=</mo><msub id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.cmml"><mi id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.2" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.2.cmml">r</mi><mi id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.3" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.3.cmml">max</mi></msub><mo id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.5" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.5.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.6" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.6.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1b"><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1"><and id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1a.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1"></and><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1b.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1"><eq id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.3"></eq><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.2">𝑟</ci><ci id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.2.3">min</ci></apply><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.2">𝑟</ci><ci id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.3">max</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1c.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1"><eq id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.5"></eq><share href="#S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.4.cmml" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1d.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1"></share><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1.1.6">1</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p1.10.m10.1c">r_{\mathrm{min}}=r_{\mathrm{max}}=1</annotation></semantics></math>. This is due to the fact that a increased learning rate owing to adaption to the fading channels can help escape the saddle point which is known as the difficulty in minimizing the loss. In addition, a larger range of DLR may result in a bigger variance of the training loss and the test accuracy, which implies that proper boundaries of DLR ratio should be chosen.</p>

More specifically, in the MISO scenario, more antennas
equipped at the devices lead to smaller differences on the channel
gain among devices. Thus the performance gain obtained by DLR is smaller
with respect to fixing learning rate. Both ‘DLR’ and ‘NDLR’ approach
the ‘Analysis’ performance eventually, which verifies the analysis
under the MISO case. In the SIMO and MIMO scenarios, more antennas
at the aggregator provide more freedom to align the received signals,
which leads to the reduced performance gap between ‘DLR’ and ‘DC’.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we incorporated the Aircomp technique in implementing distributed learning tasks to significantly improve the communication efficiency. Minimizing the aggregate error due to the fading and noisy channels is critical as a large error can lead to poor training and inference performance. Different from existing works that mainly optimized the wireless resources to align the received signals, we first proposed to utilize optimizable learning rates and proposed DLR to adapt to the fading channels. The problem was formulated under the MISO and MIMO scenarios. A closed-form solution and an iterative method were proposed respectively for each case. The simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed DLR in terms of both the MSE performance and the testing accuracy on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Asymptotic analyses in the MISO, SIMO and MIMO scenarios were also provided to address the problem of massive antenna deployment as well as to derive the theoretical bounds. On this basis, a near-optimal and closed-form receive beamforming design was proposed by simply summing up the channel vectors. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposal are verified by extensive numerical simulations.</p>
