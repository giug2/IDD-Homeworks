<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has allowed the training of statistical models over remote devices without the transfer of raw client data. In practice, training in heterogeneous and large networks introduce novel challenges in various aspects like network load, quality of client data, security and privacy. Recent works in FL have worked on improving communication efficiency and addressing uneven client data distribution independently, but none have provided a unified solution for both challenges. We introduce a new family of Federated Learning algorithms called CatFedAvg which not only improves the communication efficiency but improves the quality of learning using a category coverage maximization strategy.</p>
<p id="id5.id2" class="ltx_p">We use the FedAvg framework and introduce a simple and efficient step every epoch to collect meta-data about the client’s training data structure which the central server uses to request a subset of weight updates. We explore two distinct variations which allow us to further explore the tradeoffs between communication efficiency and model accuracy. Our experiments based on a vision classification task have shown that an increase of 10% absolute points in accuracy using the MNIST dataset with 70% absolute points lower network transfer over FedAvg. We also run similar experiments with Fashion MNIST, KMNIST-10, KMNIST-49 and EMNIST-47. Further, under extreme data imbalance experiments for both globally and individual clients, we see the model performing better than FedAvg. The ablation study further explores its behaviour under varying data and client parameter conditions showcasing the robustness of the proposed approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this era of computing, we have seen an explosion of connected personal devices and IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lueth <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. We see tremendous progress in Deep Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, which has partially been driven by the growth of data that we collect. This combination has lead to exciting research and applications in the area of distributed model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p2.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional data processing approach has been centralized with all these devices, uploading their data into cloud servers or data centres <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. This data is then processed to provide insights or training various inference models. Recently, consumers and business alike have questioned data centralization. Governments are responding by the enactment of legislation like GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Custers et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> in the EU, and Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gaff, Sussman, and Geetter <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> in the US. These laws focus on limiting data collection and storage to what the consumer has consented for and required for processing. As data collection happens at scale, there are other technical issues like latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mao et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> for real-time use cases and network loads.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">So, we see the emergence of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that use the storage and processing capabilities of the edge servers and edge devices to train models closer to the data generators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shi et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. In this solution, we transmit data to the edge servers for training a few layers, and the cloud servers do more computationally heavy tasks. This approach has shown challenges with managing communication costs and models that require continuous training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Han et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. We see the application of Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abadi et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> for privacy preservation, but many users are unwilling to expose their private data.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, we see the introduction of a decentralized ML approach called Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. It guarantees that the data remains on the personal devices and allows collaborative machine learning of complex models. A high-level view of the approach is that we cooperatively train an ML model on a mobile device using its local data. We send the client trained model’s weight to the FL server for aggregation. We repeat the steps until to reach some target accuracy. This approach is network bandwidth-efficient as only model weights are sent instead of raw data. As the model is on the mobile device, it enables privacy and makes low inference latency.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p5.1" class="ltx_p">We see its successful application in production with like the Federated Averaging Algorithm (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> used in Google’s GBoard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hard et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> to improve next-word predictions. There are other examples like recommendations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and training of health diagnosis models which allows many hospitals and government agencies can collaborate without explicit data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Brisimi et al. <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p">The Federated learning problem has a few challenges; for example, with federated networks comprising of a massive number of devices, the network data transfer costs can be humongous. There is much variability in the device capabilities in the network that leads to uncertain client behaviour. The client also generates data in a non-identically distributed manner across the network. Finally, privacy is a concern even when model weights are shared as they can reveal sensitive information about the client data.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we take on the dual challenge of communication efficiency and model training accuracy under client non-IID conditions. We see the use of two strategies for improving the communication efficiency, current work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> uses the static selection of a fraction of client models, and the other is the compression of the model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Alistarh et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. We further see that FedAvg performs badly when the client datasets are non-IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> in the experiments performed.

<div id="Sx1.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has a few statistical challenges. In traditional distributed ML, the central server has access to the complete dataset. Allowing the server to split it into subsets with similar distributions; we transfer these to the clients for distributed training. However, this approach is impractical for FL, as the dataset is local to the client.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting, the clients may have datasets with variable distributions, i.e. the datasets are non-IID. We have cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> where FedAvg is unable to achieve the desired accuracy in these conditions. When the dataset is highly skewed and non-IID, we have a solution where a common dataset is sent to the clients by the central server. However, this may not be possible in all cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also see the challenge of global imbalance where the collection of data held across all the clients is class imbalanced, which leads to a decrease in model accuracy. We see the Astrea framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Duan <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> trying to solve this problem, where clients initially send their data distribution to the server. Then we have a rebalancing step where each client performs data augmentation on minority classes. There is a mediator that selects the best clients that contribute to the uniform distributions. This approach has shown accuracy improvements.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have proposed an approach that can help tradeoff communication overheads with model accuracy with the usage of a simple and efficient technique. This family of algorithm CatFedAvg has been shown to perform better by 10AP in some cases than existing well-proven methods like FedAvg and VIRTUAL MTL. The communication efficiency has seen a jump of 70AP in some cases. We show a formal analysis that gives a framework to understand how to work with the critical parameters for the tradeoff between communication efficiency and model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We have also shown the robustness of the approach with various statistical heterogeneous conditions like global class imbalance and client distribution variations. We believe that existing techniques that involve data augmentation may not be feasible in production conditions. We would see this approach combined with compression to deliver even more communication efficiency. It would be interesting to use latency to be factored in when the initial larger set of random clients are selected. We offer a technique that can possibly work easily with Differential Privacy due to its inherent simplicity offering privacy as well.</p>
