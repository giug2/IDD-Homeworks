<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">As societal concerns on data privacy recently increase, we have witnessed data silos among multiple parties in various applications. Federated learning emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their raw data. <em id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Vertical federated learning</em>, where each party owns different features of the same set of samples and only a single party has the label, is an important and challenging topic in federated learning. Communication costs among different parties have been a major hurdle for practical vertical learning systems. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm named <span id="id10.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedOnce</span>, which requires only one-shot communication among parties. To improve model accuracy and provide privacy guarantee, FedOnce features unsupervised learning representations in the federated setting and privacy-preserving techniques based on moments accountant. The comprehensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that FedOnce achieves close performance compared to state-of-the-art vertical federated learning algorithms with much lower communication costs. Meanwhile, our privacy-preserving technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under the same privacy budget.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data silos, where physically distributed data cannot be collected on a central server due to privacy concerns and regulations, have been witnessed in many real-world applications. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> <span id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which can be classified as <span id="S1.p1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">horizontal federated learning</span> and <span id="S1.p1.1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vertical federated learning</span> according to the data partitioning among parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, is proposed as an emerging learning paradigm to enable collaborative training without exposing the data of each party. Different from horizontal federated learning where each party shares the same feature space but owns only a subset of samples, vertical federated learning, where each party shares the same sample space but only holds a subset of features, is a common and important scenario in practice.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Privacy by design</span> (PbD), as a key concept in <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, states that personal data from different services/applications under the same company should not be directly shared with each other. This concept motivates our study to develop a collaborative machine learning framework to train a privacy-preserving model from all parties. Particularly, we consider each service/application as a party in federated learning and assume that the party holding labels, named <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">host party</span>, is trusted by other parties without labels, named <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">guest parties</span>. Such trust is practical as all the parties are under the same company. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> presents a concrete example of this setting<span id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">, which is an end-to-end procedure containing model training and model deployment</span>. An e-commerce company provides two major services: 1) an online shopping service managed by the retailing department and 2) an e-banking service managed by the Fintech department. This company aims to train a machine learning model to recommend its users the proper investing amount. Under the principle of privacy by design, although the Fintech department can be trusted by the retailing department, direct data sharing is prohibited. Therefore, these departments have to perform training by transferring intermediate information. After the training, a model can be released to provide recommendation services for the users of this e-commerce company. <span id="S1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Typical applications of federated learning includes Google Keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and nationwide learning health system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Considering the model training, </span>communication issues have limited the practical adoption of vertical federated learning in many real-world applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For example, such limitation becomes non-negligible when parties are 1) mobile devices communicating through Cellular networks, 2) IoT devices communicating through Wi-Fi networks, 3) seagoing ships communicating through satellites. These applications, featuring unstable connections and expensive communication cost, cannot be handled by existing vertical federated learning algorithms for two major reasons, including 1) <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">high stability requirement</span>: existing vertical federated learning approaches require all the parties to stay online or even synchronous during the entire training process, which is unrealistic for parties connected by unstable networks; 2) <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">high communication cost</span>: current studies in vertical federated learning usually incur large communication overhead, leading to the considerable economic cost. For example, in each training iteration, SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, VF<sup id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Boost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and Pivot <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> exchange encrypted intermediate results (e,g, gradients) between the host party and guest parties. Similarly, when training each batch of data, SplitNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> transfers outputs and gradients of a common layer between the host party and guest parties. All these approaches require batch/iteration-level synchronization and high communication cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the practicability of vertical federated learning, designing a learning algorithm with a single communication round (i.e., one-shot), which can highly reduce the stability requirement and the communication cost, becomes increasingly desirable. Although some one-shot approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have been proposed for horizontal federated learning where each party shares the same feature space but owns only a subset of samples, these approaches cannot be directly adopted in vertical federated learning. The key challenge is that the labels only exist in a single party in vertical federated learning. These labels, which cannot be shared among parties due to privacy concerns, are necessary for the training of most models. For example, calculating gradients in neural networks or gradient boosting decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> relies on the labels. To the best of our knowledge, one-shot vertical federated learning algorithms have not been explored yet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedOnce, a novel one-shot vertical federated learning algorithm, the source code<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://github.com/JerryLife/FedOnce</span></span></span> of which is available online. FedOnce is designed for neural networks which are broadly used in many applications. Instead of aggregating the local models in horizontal learning, we propose the idea that the host party trains a model to aggregate the representations collected from guest parties. Specifically, guest parties first extract representative features by <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unsupervised learning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. These representative features, which can effectively boost the performance of federated learning, are sent to the host party. After receiving all the representative features, the host party trains an aggregation model based on these features and its own data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the model deployment after the training, these released models are threatened by membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">which detects the existence of training instances by inference. To protect the trained models in FedOnce from this attack, we exploit differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to theoretically guarantee that the training samples is indistinguishable given the trained model.</span> Despite many studies that apply differential privacy to horizontal federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, their privacy analyses cannot be directly applied to vertical federated learning. The main reason is that vertical federated learning requires analyzing inter-party privacy loss since each data record is distributed to multiple parties, whereas horizontal federated learning only requires analyzing inner-party privacy loss since each data record is held by a single party. Some existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> employ differential privacy in vertical federated learning. Nonetheless, these studies, focusing on inner-party privacy loss, only consider simple composition when analyzing inter-party privacy loss. In FedOnce, by refining the analysis of inter-party privacy loss based on moments accountant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we significantly reduce the privacy loss compared to existing approaches.</p>

Finally, all the parties perform backpropagation on their local models. In each iteration of training, both forward propagation and backpropagation are performed for one time. Therefore, the training incurs two communication rounds between the host party and each guest party every iteration, which is impractical when parties are connected by unstable and expensive networks. This pitfall of SplitNN motivates our design of a one-shot vertical federated learning framework.</p>

FedOnce with no protection on released models is denoted as FedOnce-L0, corresponding to the scenario where the trained model is used inside the company, thus free from privacy attacks. FedOnce ensuring differential privacy of the released model is denoted as FedOnce-L1, corresponding to the scenario where the trained model is released to the public (either as white-box or black-box), thus threatened by the membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

At the end of the training process of FedOnce, each party holds a guest model and the host party additionally holds an aggregation model; the combination of these models can be regarded as a pre-trained model of SplitNN. Therefore, the training process of SplitNN can be directly applied to further boost the performance of FedOnce. Specifically, in each iteration, guest parties perform forward propagation and transfer intermediate outputs to the host party.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, assuming the host party is trusted among all the parties, we enable collaborative training by representation sharing to comply with GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, in some applications, this setting may not be true and the representations are potentially threatened by privacy attacks. Such an attack could be similarly designed as the reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> in horizontal federated learning. This privacy risk indicates merely prohibiting unnecessary data sharing is not sufficient to guarantee privacy. More strict and clear regulations above GDPR are desired to measure the permitted information leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address this privacy issue, some techniques adopted to protect gradients such as local differential privacy (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, homomorphic encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and secure multi-party computation (MPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> can potentially assist. Among these techniques, HE and MPC incur large computational cost, which is a heavy burden for devices with limited computational resources like smart Wi-Fi routers. LDP inserts noise into transferred gradients to guarantee the privacy of each party. Nevertheless, representations in FedOnce, in the format of matrices, cannot be similarly analyzed like gradients. Another approach is to regard the representations as released data and adopt privacy-preserving data release <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> to add noise to the representations. As elaborated in Section <a href="#S5.SS8" title="5.8 Noise on Representations ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.8</span></a>, this method is a possible solution, whereas the noise on representations should be strictly bounded to a small scale; otherwise, FedOnce could suffer considerable performance loss. In conclusion, more advanced methods are desired to protect the privacy representations in this new scenario where the host party cannot be trusted.</p>

First, FedOnce-L0 significantly outperforms Solo, SplitNN-Comm, and SecureBoost-Comm on each party, indicating a huge performance-boosting against SplitNN and SecureBoost under the same communication size.

For example, FedOnce-L0 only incurs 0.3% accuracy loss compared to Combine on <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MNIST</span>, and incurs 0.09% accuracy loss compared to Combine on <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">phishing</span>. Third, except on simple datasets like <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gisette</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">phishing</span>, centralized linear models are significantly outperformed by FedOnce and most other baselines. This indicates that vertical federated learning methods with these linear models, which produce even poorer performance, are not competitive in most cases.</p>

For each dataset, we record the training time of SplitNN and FedOnce-L0 in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 5.2 Performance of Different Host Parties ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. As observed from the table, FedOnce-L0 generally has a lower training time than SplitNN; this is because the local models in FedOnce can be trained in parallel, while all the local models are connected with the aggregation model and trained in each iteration in SplitNN. We also highlight that the communication time is measured in a shared-memory environment of a single machine. In reality, the communication time can also be a huge burden for SplitNN which requires much more communication size as demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Three observations can be made from the results. First, FedOnce-L0 (the first data point of multi-round FedOnce-L0) significantly outperforms SplitNN and SecureBoost at a small communication size. Second, only under considerable communication size, can SplitNN and SecureBoost achieve the same performance as FedOnce-L0. For example, on <span id="S5.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">KMNIST</span> dataset, SplitNN requires a 17x communication size to achieve the same performance as FedOnce-L0. Third, multi-round FedOnce-L0 consistently outperforms SplitNN and SecureBoost as communication size increases.</p>

This is because PCA is incapable to extract useful representations from complex features like images. On the contrary, NAT is a suitable unsupervised learning method for FedOnce that can handle different types of features. <span id="S5.SS6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Generally, more “advanced” unsupervised learning algorithms tend to produce a better performance on FedOnce. The performance of unsupervised learning methods can be evaluated by commonly used metrics in the literature. For example, NAT is evaluated by the performance of a linear classifier on the learned representations.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy in Federated Learning.</span>
Federated learning confronts two major privacy threats. First, during the training, intermediate results (e.g., gradients) could be vulnerable to backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> or reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. This privacy risk can be addressed by multiple methods including homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, secure multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and local differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Second, after the training, the released model could be exposed to the membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which can be defended by ensuring differential privacy of the released model (namely <span id="S6.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global differential privacy</span>). This defense is different from local differential privacy since it protects against outside attackers instead of malicious aggregators.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, existing studies on global differential privacy under vertical federated learning suffer significant performance loss. One study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> achieves differential privacy by <span id="S6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">objective perturbation</span>, which is often intractable in practice compared to <span id="S6.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gradient perturbation</span> according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, in both studies, the simple composition is directly applied in the analysis of privacy loss across parties, leading to excessive noise. In this paper, we apply moments accountant to analyze the inter-party privacy loss, thus effectively reducing the overall privacy loss compared to simple composition.</p>

Though some approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> study the communication efficiency in vertical federated learning, they all require multiple communication rounds and a certain level of synchronization. As observed from Table <a href="#S6.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ 6 Related Work ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>, vertical federated learning with one-shot communication remains unexplored.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedOnce, a novel one-shot algorithm for vertical federated learning. Moreover, we develop a privacy mechanism for FedOnce (FedOnce-L1) under the notion of differential privacy and refine inter-party privacy loss. Our experiments demonstrate that FedOnce-L0 achieves impressive performance compared to state-of-the-art vertical federated learning algorithms with only one-shot communication. Besides, FedOnce-L1 significantly outperforms the baseline in our evaluation.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">To evaluate the performance of FedOnce on complex image datasets, additional experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 which consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. We divide the features both horizontally and vertically into four parties; each party holds a 16x16 partial image with full three channels. Since it is an open problem to fit more advanced deep learning models in unsupervised learning contexts, we use CNN0 in Fig. 4 (the same model we use for other image datasets) as a starting point to demonstrate our proposal on more complex datasets. The experimental setting is similar to that in Section 5.3. We present the performance of each approach as the communication cost increases in Fig. <a href="#A2.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ Appendix B Supplement Experiment on CIFAR-10 ‣ Practical Vertical Federated Learning with Unsupervised Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>.</span></p>

<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">During the distributed machine learning process, some parties may respond slowly due to communication bottlenecks. The existence of these parties, denoted as <span id="A3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">laggy parties</span>, is one of the major hurdles of federated learning. Although FedOnce significantly reduces the effect of laggy parties by communicating for only one round, the impact of laggy parties has not been eliminated. Therefore, in this section, we present an intuitive solution to tackle this issue in FedOnce.</span></p>
