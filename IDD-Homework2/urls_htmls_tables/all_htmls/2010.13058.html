In this paper, we consider a new architecture of digital twin empowered Industrial IoT where digital twins capture the characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning. Noticing that digital twins may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning, to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of Industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed framework is superior to the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), as an extension use of IoT, interconnects numerous industrial devices, analytical sections, and people at work. Through exquisite cooperation of machinery devices, Industrial IoT enables automatic manufacturing applications ranging from automotive to agriculture, and finally realizing Industry 4.0 [1]. The success of Industrial IoT hinges on dynamic perception and intelligent decision, which is difficult to capture due to the heterogeneous Industrial IoT devices and the complex industrial environment [2].</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Digital twin (DT), as an emerging digitalization technology, offers a feasible solution to capture the dynamic and complex industrial environment [3]. It creates virtual objects in the digital space through software definition, accurately mapping entities in the physical space in terms of status, features and evolution. Its excellent state awareness and real-time analysis greatly assist decision-making and execution. However, DTs are data-driven and a decision making in Industrial IoT usually needs to be supported by a large amount of data distributed across a variety of training devices, while “data islands” exist in most data sources due to competition, privacy and security issues [4]. In reality, it is almost impossible to integrate data scattered in various devices. The dual challenges of privacy protection and big data present an opportunity to develop new technologies that aggregate and model the data under strict prerequisites.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning turns out to be a powerful weapon to enable distributed advanced analysis in Industrial IoT [5]. Federated learning is a model training technology that data owners can perform model training locally without sharing their data, which helps ensure privacy and reduce communication costs. There have been works on designing advanced federated learning algorithms to achieve better learning performance including privacy preservation and learning efficiency [6] [7]. To address the limited communication bandwidth, Yang <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> [7] proposed a fast global aggregation scheme by device selection and beamforming design. The problem is solved using an optimization problem with global convergence guarantees. In order to improve the learning effect, Lu <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> [8] introduce a learning framework of asynchronous mode, which accelerated the convergence speed of learning, but the point-to-point communication mode caused a great communication burden.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Existing efforts [6-8] do not take into account the dynamic Industrial environment and the adaptive federated learning architecture accordingly. In fact, the frequency and timing of aggregation should be carefully designed in federated learning, as the gain of global aggregation is non-linear and the network environment, e.g. the channel state, is time-varying during the federated learning process. It is also noted that for heterogeneous Industrial IoT scenario, the straggler effect makes the synchronized federated learning suffer an unbearable learning delay. To address these issues, we study adaptive calibration of the global aggregation frequency based on knowledge from DTs to improve training efficiency under resource constraints. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous federated learning framework based on node clustering. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works of federated learning mainly focuse on update architecture, aggregation strategy and frequency aggregation.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Update architecture.</span>
Most of the current algorithms use synchronous architecture, such as FedAvg [5]. However, the synchronous architecture makes the duration of training limited to slower nodes and not suitable for scenarios where the node resources are heterogeneous, i.e., the straggler effect.
A few studies have also considered asynchronous learning, e.g., <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Lu et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> allow asynchronous updates through a random distributed update scheme, but it does cause out-of-order communication between nodes, which is indeed a huge communication burden. In addition, <em id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Fadlullah et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> studied the asynchronous update of weights, which supports shallow parameters to be updated more frequently in an asynchronous manner but does not eliminate the straggler effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aggregation strategy.</span>
The current research has explored the influence of factors such as data size, computing power, and reputation value on aggregation [10-12], which are closely related to application scenarios. To capture the relationship between non-IID and unbalanced data, FedAvg weighted the data amount of the training nodes. In a resource-constrained scenario, <em id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Nishio et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> comprehensively consider the data resources, computing power, and wireless channel conditions of heterogeneous mobile devices to accelerate convergence. <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Pandey et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduce communication efficiency to measure the reliability of equipment, and establish a probability model to calculate the corresponding aggregation weight.
Obviously, finding out the important factors that affect the training effect under the specific application scenario is the top priority in solving the aggregation challenge of federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aggregation frequency.</span>
The adaptive calibration of the global aggregation frequency is beneficial to improve the scalability and efficiency of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. To better adapt to dynamic resource constraints, <em id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Wang et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed an adaptive global aggregation scheme to change the global aggregation frequency to improve training efficiency under resource constraints. Similarly, <em id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Tran et al.</em> [17] captured the trade-off between computation and communication delay determined by learning accuracy,
and defined an optimization problem about the global optimal learning time which can be decomposed into three convex subproblems to solve.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In general, there are still some issues to be solved in federated learning, i.e., the straggler effect is not completely eliminated, the adaptive aggregation frequency in Industrial IoT. In this paper, we combine DTs and <em id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DQN</em> to adaptively reduce energy consumption and design an asynchronous federated learning framework to eliminate the straggler effect.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Industrial IoT, when resource-constrained industrial devices (excavators, sensors, monitors, industrial robots, etc.) need complete manufacturing tasks, such as defective detection, they typically train a global model collaboratively based on federated learning using the their own data set. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, a machinery device collects a large amount of production data in a real-time monitoring environment and trains its detective model. Then each device would upload their local model (may be different from each other due to heterogeneous data set) to the curator (typically an edge server), which completes the aggregation and update of the model parameters, and returns the updated parameters to each machinery device. Each device repeats the next iteration until the entire training process converges. Through collaboration of machinery devices based on federated learning, intelligent decisions can be made for quality control and predictive maintenance.</p>

on the honesty of most training devices. The difference between the parameters uploaded by a node and the average value of the parameters uploaded by all nodes positively affects the learning quality of a client. From (4), we can see that the higher the learning quality of a client, the higher its reputation value will be. Moreover, the curator will also choose the node with higher reputation value in order to improve the learning accuracy and resist malicious attacks.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Based on the <em id="S4.SS1.p2.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Lyapunov optimization</em>, a dynamic resource deficit queue is established to simplify <span id="S4.SS1.p2.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> by dividing the long-term resource budget into available resource budget for each time slot. Lyapunov optimization has been widely used in control theory, which can make the system stable in different forms. Firstly, we construct a virtual queue that satisfies the constraints of <span id="S4.SS1.p2.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span> for Lyapunov optimization, and then we define the Lyapunov function to represent the backlog of all virtual queues in time slot t. Secondly, we design the difference of the Lyapunov function between two subsequent time slots. Finally, by minimizing the Lyapunov drift of each time slot, and always pushing the backlog to a lower congestion state, we can intuitively maintain the stability of the queue. We define the length of the under-resource queue as the difference between used resources and available resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.I1.i4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">It can be found that the consumed computational energy is a factor affecting the reward function, which is also affected by the DT deviation. Due to the existence of DT deviation, the actual reward value may deviate from the expected reward, resulting in unstable and unreliable decision-making, which is very likely to invalidate the learning process. In order to solve this issue, we add the weight of node reputation value in (4). After that, CPU frequency error can be corrected by the corresponding weighting factor, which reduces the influence of DT deviation on model learning.</p>

According to the previous analysis, function non-convergence will inevitably lead to oscillation, which also leads to continuous improvement of strategic value. However, the strategy space is limited, the fixed point of the strategy value is also limited. One of the fixed points must be the largest, which is the optimal fixed point. Actually in our simulation diagram, the fixed point with the largest value exists, which is contradictory to continuous improvement. That is, our strategy is convergent.</p>

The action space includes the number of training sessions for each node, determined by the curator. The initial state is randomly chosen. The previous state and the model loss value can jointly determine the number of training required by the node in the current state, that is, the action in the current state. Then the action will cause the node resource value and the model loss value to change, that is, the next state.</p>

As shown in Fig. 1, DTs map all aspects of the physical objects of the Industrial IoT environment to the virtual space in real time, forming a digital mirror image. At the same time, the DRL agent interacts with the DTs of the devices to learn the global aggregation frequency decision. The Federated learning module makes frequency decisions based on the trained model and the DT status of the training nodes. Through DTs, the agent achieves the same training effect as the real environment at a lower cost.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In an Industrial IoT scenario where devices are highly heterogeneous in terms of available data sizes and computing resources, single-round training speed is likely to be limited by the slowest nodes, i.e., the straggle effect, and synchronous training is not applicable. Therefore, we propose an asynchronous federated learning framework. The basic idea is to classify nodes with different computing power by clustering and configuring corresponding curators for each cluster to enable each cluster to train autonomously with different local aggregation frequency. Within a cluster, the aggregation frequency is obtained through the DQN-based adaptive frequency calibration algorithm mentioned in Section IV-C. The specific asynchronous federated learning process is as follows.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning is based on reward hypothesis that all goals can be described as maximizing the expected cumulative reward. The reward function is set to guide agent activities, and poorly designed rewards generally cause the network to not converge or the agent simply does not experience what it wants to learn. Fig. 2 depicts the trend of the loss value, from which we can see that agent’s loss has stabilized after about 1200 rounds of training and converged to a better result.

In addition, we can observe that <em id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DQN</em> with DT deviation cannot converge.</p>

<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Adaptive Federated Learning and Digital Twin for Industrial Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the total number of aggregations required to complete federated learning and the number of aggregations in a good channel state as the channel state changes. As the distribution of good channel states increases, the number of aggregations in good channel states increases. It is noted that almost all aggregations are completed within 5 rounds due to the fact that DQN learning finds that the benefits of less aggregation times are greater. Moreover, it can be seen that when the probability of being in a good channel equals 0.2, the total aggregation number is more than other cases. This is because when the channel state is varying and sometimes poor, the agent tends to wait until good channel state to make aggregation. With frequent bad channel state, as shown in the case of 0.2, the agent is prone to generate local optimal strategies, which leads to larger number of average aggregations, i.e. 5.47. There is an exception when the probability of good channel equals 0. Because when the channel state is constant, the agent won’t wait for the good channel state and will make aggregation anyway at higher communication cost, thus the average number of aggregations is also 5, the same as that of 1. In other cases, when the good channel ratio increases (higher than 0.2), it is easier for the agent to make aggregation adaptively at good channel state and make global optimal strategies (the average number of aggregations approaching 5). It shows that through continuous learning, <em id="S5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DQN</em> intelligently avoids performing aggregation in poor channel conditions.</p>

It can be seen that energy consumption decreases with the improvement of channel quality, which is mainly due to the fact that aggregation consumes more communication resources when channel quality is poor. With the training of <em id="S5.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DQN</em>, the energy consumption in all three channel states decreases. This is because <em id="S5.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DQN</em> can adaptively calibrate aggregation timing so that federated learning selects local training instead of long-delay and high-energy-consuming aggregation when the channel quality is relatively poor.</p>

It can be seen that the more clusters, the higher accuracy the training can achieve in the same time, which is because the clustering effectively uses the computing power of heterogeneous nodes through different local aggregation times.
