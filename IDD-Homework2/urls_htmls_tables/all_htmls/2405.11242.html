<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">This study presents an integrated approach for advancing functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging through the synthesis of data and application of machine learning models. By addressing the scarcity of high-quality neuroimaging datasets, this work harnesses Monte Carlo simulations and parametric head models to generate a comprehensive synthetic dataset, reflecting a wide spectrum of conditions. We developed a containerized environment employing Docker and Xarray for standardized and reproducible data analysis, facilitating meaningful comparisons across different signal processing modalities. Additionally, a cloud-based infrastructure is established for scalable data generation and processing, enhancing the accessibility and quality of neuroimaging data. The combination of synthetic data generation with machine learning techniques holds promise for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of fNIRS tomography, potentially revolutionizing diagnostics and treatment strategies for neurological conditions. The methodologies and infrastructure developed herein set new standards in data simulation and analysis, paving the way for future research in neuroimaging and the broader biomedical engineering field.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of optical methods for assessing changes in the optical properties of brain tissue began with Glenn Millikan’s invention of the muscle oximeter in the forties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Frans Jöbsis founded in vivo near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), utilizing the transparency of brain tissue in the NIR range to detect hemoglobin oxygenation noninvasively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Marco Ferrari used prototype NIRS instruments to measure changes in brain oxygenation in experimental animal models and human adults. From 1980 to 1995, several companies collaborated with universities to develop NIRS prototypes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Functional imaging is the assessment of physiological changes associated with brain activity. Functional MRI (fMRI) based on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging was first suggested in 1990 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and was followed by the discovery of human functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in 1992 by by Chance, Kato, Hoshi, and Villringer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. fNIRS detects changes in the optical properties of the cortex and provides maps or images of specific areas. The increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and the decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin reflect an increase in local blood flow and volume due to neurovascular coupling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">fNIRS is based on human tissues being relatively transparent to light in the NIR spectral window (650-1000 nm) and that NIR light can penetrate tissues due to scattering being more probable than absorption. Hemoglobin is the main chromophore that attenuates NIR light in tissue, and its absorption spectrum depends on its level of oxygenation. In the NIR spectral window light absorption increases as a function of frequency for oxygenated hemoglobin and decreases for deoxygenated hemoglobin. The absorption characteristics are equal at approximately 810 nm. This is the isosbestic point. The Beer-Lambert Law relates the attenuation of light to the concentration of absorbing species in a medium, e.g. oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In turbid media such as biological tissues, light scattering is a significant factor that must be considered. The Modified Beer-Lambert Law is a general form of the Beer-Lambert Law that takes into account the effects of light scattering in addition to light absorption by a medium. The Modified Beer-Lambert Law extends the Beer-Lambert Law to include the effects of light scattering by introducing a scattering coefficient in addition to the absorption coefficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The cortical hemodynamic response to brain activity is characterized by hyper oxygenation. This is due to the metabolic demands of neuronal activity. Temporally, the response is characterized by an initial dip on the order of milliseconds followed by an increase in oxygenation which occurs on the order of seconds. Increases typically initiate two seconds after stimulus. A return to resting state concentration levels occurs approximately 16 seconds after stimulus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">fNIRS systems are comprised of a power source connected to a controller, instructions from the controller are relayed through a preamplifier to light sources. The choice of light sources, such as laser diodes (LDs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs), depends on the specific requirements of the study. LDs have narrow spectral peaks, emit coherent light, and are suitable for fiber optic coupling, but pose a potential danger to the eyes. LEDs emit incoherent light, have a wide bandwidth, and can be easily adjusted in intensity. The selection of wavelengths affect the quality of measurement data. Light sources with sharply peaked radiation spectra, such as monochromatic light, are desirable for fNIRS measurements at several discrete wavelengths. Selecting optimal wavelengths depends on several variables, including the number of wavelengths used, the number and type of chromophores considered, the model of the background medium, and the mathematical approach to solve the optimization problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. fNIRS devices can be bifurcated to those who use 2 discrete wavelengths and those who use 3 or more wavelengths. For two-wavelength fNIRS devices, the optimum wavelength in combination with 830 nanometers (nm) should be ¡ 780 nm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the optimal wavelength pair for a two-wavelength fNIRS device appears to be 704 <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pm" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">\pm</annotation></semantics></math> 7 + 887 <math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pm" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">\pm</annotation></semantics></math> 12 nm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. There are two options to transfer light from source to medium of interest, the first by placing sources and detectors directly on the skin, the second by guiding light through optical fibers to probes on the head. Direct placement has minimal light coupling losses but potential hazards, while fiber optic transmission allows for more flexible probe design but has added weight and reduced mobility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The scattered photons which exit the scalp are detected by photodiodes. The two most common types of photo diodes used in fNIRS Systems are photodiodes (PD) and avalanche photodiodes (APD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Charge couple devices (CCD’s) can also be used to detect photons and have an advantage for detecting broadband signals as well as providing spatial information. For optimal performance these detectors should be power stabilized and amplified using little noise amplifiers. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) maybe used as detectors for fNIRS instrumentation, which enables measurements at larger source-detector separations (SDS) while affording small, lightweight, and modular probes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. SiPMs enable measurements at an SDS up to 50 millimeters (mm), which is 67% more than the commonly used SDS of 30 mm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, have large internal amplification, and allow for simple and miniaturizable data readout, thus making SiPMs desirable as photo detectors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">There are three techniques implemented by fNIRS systems; continuous wave (CW), time domain (TD), and frequency domain (FD) fNIRS systems. CW-fNIRS and fd-fNIRS systems emit a constant (non-pulsating) signal whereas td-fNIRS systems emit a high frequency pulsating signal. CW-fNIRS measure attenuation and cannot provide absolute values of hemoglobin concentration. Contrastly, fd-fNIRS measure both attenuation and phase differences. The added information from the modulating light source in the form of a phase shift can provide additional information with higher resolution than that of CW technique. TD-fNIRS measure changes in pulse shape and are extremely fast, on the order of picoseconds, however equipment is very expensive and sensitive to artifacts when compared to the other two techniques.</p>

Docker Compose is a widely used tool in the field of containerization that enables the easy deployment of containers. It allows users to define the required services, dependencies, networks, and volumes in a single file, which can be used to create and start all the required containers with a single command (docker-compose up). Volumes are useful for persisting data between service runs. Docker Compose also provides support for orchestration and deployment in clustered environments.</p>

Some of these disadvantages are limited availability, high financial burden, limited temporal resolution, unnatural testing environment, and susceptibility to motion artifacts. To date, there is no model for transforming from fNIRS space to semantic space.

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Monte Carlo simulations have proven invaluable in modeling photon migration through turbid media such as human tissues. These simulations are conducted by launching a vast number of photons and tracking their paths through the medium, effectively simulating each photon’s random walk. This approach estimates the probability distribution of photon paths and energy deposition without directly solving complex differential equations. This method is particularly advantageous in turbid, low-scattering media, establishing it as the gold standard in bio-optical imaging applications like functional brain imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

MCX enables the simultaneous simulation of millions of photons, offering a significant speed increase compared to traditional CPU-based Monte Carlo methods. It supports both mesh-based and parametric modeling; the former provides high anatomical fidelity suitable for localized studies, while the latter offers a computationally less demanding approach for broader, generalized investigations.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to conduct Monte Carlo simulations for the study of light propagation in biological tissues, particularly the brain, it is necessary to know the optical properties of various brain components. Determining these properties requires defining the spatial domain through which photons will travel. Brain atlases are instrumental in mapping the complex anatomical and functional regions of the brain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Historically, brain atlases were developed based on the post-mortem examination of human brains, exemplified by Brodmann atlas, which demarcated 52 distinct regions of the cerebral cortex based on variations in cytoarchitecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Advancements in medical imaging technologies, such as MRI and CT scans have enhanced the resolution and diversity of brain images available for study. This has facilitated the development of more detailed atlases, based on living subjects, thereby enabling the generation of atlases that better represent the variability found across different populations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Anatomical variations between individuals and among different demographic groups have been observed. These variations provide incentive for generating atlases tailored towards specific populations. Notably, atlases that concentrate on the brain’s vasculature are increasingly relevant in the context of fNIRS, where understanding the intricacies of cerebral blood flow is of prime importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most atlases focus solely on brain tissue, overlooking non-brain structures such as the scalp and skull. These elements are necessary for Monte Carlo simulations of photon migration. There is a growing need for incorporating these non-brain structures in atlases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The creation of brain atlases follows a structured pipeline. The process, inspired by the LONI pipeline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This method begins with MRI data acquisition, providing the raw anatomical information for atlas creation. This data is pre-processed adjusting the raw MRI data for better quality and uniformity. Preprocessing steps include stripping to remove non-relevant tissue and normalizing the intensity of MRI images for consistency. Subsequently, the pre-processed data is segmented into different tissue types e.g., gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, etc. The individual MRI scans are aligned and registered to a common standard space, ensuring consistency across different subjects. By averaging the registered MRI data, a composite image is created that represents the typical anatomy of the study population. This averaged data forms the basis of the brain atlas. The final step involves transforming the averaged MRI data into a three-dimensional mesh.</p>

The complexity involved in setting up these simulations, especially considering the configurations and parameters required, can be daunting. Furthermore, typical brain atlases lack comprehensive inclusion of non-brain tissues such as the scalp and skull, which are integral to bio-fidelic Monte Carlo simulations in fNIRS studies. This omission render many of these atlases inappropriate for simulations of light propagation in biological tissues, without extensive post processing for adding these tissues.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the inherent complexities associated with mesh-based simulations, particularly those that require detailed brain atlases, parametric models serve as a compelling alternative for initial stages of research or for establishing a proof of concept. The motivation for utilizing parametric models stems from their simplicity and flexibility. Unlike mesh-based models that rely on detailed anatomical structures, parametric models use geometric shapes and predefined parameters to approximate the human head and its internal structures. This simplification significantly reduces the setup time and computational resources required, enabling rapid testing and iteration of different scenarios.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The meninges play a crucial role in protecting the brain, serving as a set of three layered membranes that encapsulate it. These layers, from the outermost to the innermost, are the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Particularly of interest is the subarachnoid space, sandwiched between the arachnoid and the pia mater. This space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is responsible for the majority of the meninges’ volume. Due to the significant volume occupied by the CSF in the subarachnoid space, it becomes a rational choice for parameterization in our head model. Such a representation allows for a more streamlined and anatomically representative model that efficiently captures the physiological significance of the meninges. In determining the appropriate thickness for the CSF parameter, we have settled on a value of 2.5 mm. This choice is grounded in the empirical findings presented by Parisa Saboori and Ali Sadegh in their detailed examination of the brain’s subarachnoid trabeculae <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The configuration of sources and detectors, collectively known as optodes, is a yeah another important aspect of simulating light propagation in MCX simulations. Optode placement directly influences the spatial resolution and depth sensitivity of fNIRS measurements. For our MCX simulations, we mirror the optode configuration of our fNIRS device, which comprises 32 sources and 32 detectors arranged in a uniform grid.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The synthesized data aims to closely resemble that obtained from the fNIRS device used to capture Dataset 01 and 02. The device’s optodes are arranged in a 2x16 grid format. In MCX, source and detector locations must be specified outside the scalp to simulate the actual conditions of an fNIRS measurement. These locations are derived from the fNIRS device’s configurations and are adjusted to reside just outside the scalp in our parametric head model, ensuring an accurate representation of the measurement geometry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The sources in our MCX simulations emit light in a ’pencil’ manner, meaning they emit photons in a specific direction, which is typically perpendicular to the scalp surface at the point of emission. The directionality and intensity parameters affect the penetration depth and the area of the brain being illuminated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Detectors in MCX are configured to capture photons exiting the scalp, registering their amount, exit locations and the total weight of the photon packet, which correlates with the amount of light absorbed and scattered through the brain tissue. The detectors, governed by their radius, is set to match the actual fNIRS detectors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For our simulations, we have adapted the source and detector locations from our fNIRS device setup. The resultant model may be biased for the specific geometry. The spherical coordinates are converted to Cartesian coordinates to fit the MCX input requirements, ensuring that the sources and detectors are appropriately placed relative to our parametric head model.

</div>
<div id="S7.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The .jnii files, an abbreviation for ”JSON NIfTI,” encapsulate the spatially resolved flux data. This format provides a comprehensive depiction of the distribution and intensity of light as it propagates through the simulated tissue environment. The .jnii files record the scattering and absorption events, thereby recording the spatial variations attributable to differing tissue properties. This mapping enables visualization of light propagation and interaction with various tissue components. This visualization can provide insight regarding photonic behavior within structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The .jdat files hold time-resolved information regarding photon detection. These files log the count of photons reaching each detector within the model, segmenting the data temporally to reflect the dynamics of photon capture. This temporal resolution is critical for the analysis of the light’s time of flight.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of machine learning applications for fNIRS tomography, the .jdat file’s detector-specific photon counts are particularly valuable. By extracting this data photon counts can be incorporated into a dataset representative of observed physiological conditions. This dataset then acts as the input for machine learning models, which are tasked with predicting the ground truth of the head model, focusing notably on the location and characteristics of simulated blood vessels or anomalies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The potential utility of .jnii files in the context of machine learning, especially for backpropagation algorithms, should not be overlooked. These files could provide a spatial context for the photon counts recorded in .jdat files, offering a detailed background against which the machine learning models can refine their predictions. For instance, by comparing the spatial flux distributions from .jnii files with the photon count data, models may better learn how light propagates through tissue, enabling more accurate reconstructions of the underlying tissue structure. It is important to mention that flux measurements are only available for simulations. Real world recordings of fNIRS experiments yield photon counts at detector locations, thus the motivation to extract this data from the simulated environment.</p>

<p id="S7.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The number of MCX simulations that can run in parallel on a single machine is restricted by the machine’s hardware capabilities, particularly in terms of GPU and CPU resources. Cloud computing addresses this bottleneck by enabling scalable computational resources that can be adjusted according to the workload’s demands. Beyond scalability, cloud computing ensures a standardized computational environment, essential for reproducibility and consistency across simulations.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This article provides an overview of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as an established method for studying neurovascular phenomena. The article proposes a systematic approach for setting up a data environment to enable meaningful comparisons between different signal processing and machine learning modalities. To facilitate this, the authors set up a containerized environment using industry-standard tools for data provenance and consistency, which lays the infrastructure for subsequent research towards blind tomography and semantic-hemodynamic space transformation. The article also provides a brief history of the development of optical methods for assessing changes in the optical properties of brain tissue and discusses the physics of fNIRS, including the Beer-Lambert Law and the Modified Beer-Lambert Law, as well as the cortical hemodynamic response to brain activity. Further, the article briefly describes the components of fNIRS systems and the factors that influence the quality of measurement data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The datasets were stored in the NetCDF file format, which is a binary file format used to store scientific data and metadata in a self-describing form. The Xarray library was used to load the datasets, which provides support for labeled, multi-dimensional arrays and integrates with a range of other scientific Python packages. The Docker platform was used to create a self-contained environment for running the Jupyter notebook with the necessary dependencies for fNIRS. The Dockerfile was used to build an image for a Jupyter notebook with the required dependencies, and the mamba package manager was used to install additional dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. The study’s data analysis environment was thus standardized and reproducible, which enhances data provenance and simplifies the installation and configuration of software and its dependencies.</p>

<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Using a novel fd-fNIRS device two datasets were recorded. Dataset 01 consists of three experiment runs, and provides detailed information on its dimensions, coordinates, and values. The dataset is complex in nature, capturing both the magnitude and phase components of the fd-fNIRS system. Spatial information is provided for each detector and source in three dimensions, and a function is used to estimate the z values based on the subject’s head circumference. The article highlights the importance of SDS and NN values in determining the probability of detecting photons, and how the difference between two-dimensional and three-dimensional distances between the sources and detectors may have a significant impact on DOT calculations. The author found that detecting faulty sources or detectors can be done by comparing the mean of magnitude data across time with the average value for source detector pairs with the same NN value, and visualizing them in a heat map to detect coupling strength.</p>

<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of semantic representation is introduced as the process of capturing the meaning of natural language text in a way that can be used to reason about, understand, and manipulate its content. The use of fMRI imaging for predicting nouns is discussed, along with the advantages of using fNIRS imaging over fMRI. The article then presents Dataset 02, which explores the relationship between semantic representation and neurovascular coupling data obtained using fNIRS, including its dimensions and variables. The article also provides a list of questions that can be used to classify objects into different categories based on their appearance, function, and other characteristics.</p>
