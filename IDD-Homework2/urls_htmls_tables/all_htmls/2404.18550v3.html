<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">The proposed IncidentResponseGPT framework - a novel system that applies generative artificial intelligence (AI) to potentially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic incident response. This model allows for synthesis of region-specific incident response guidelines and generates incident response plans adapted to specific area, aiming to expedite decision-making for traffic management authorities. This approach aims to accelerate incident resolution times by suggesting various recommendations (e.g. optimal rerouting strategies, estimating resource needs) to minimize the overall impact on the urban traffic network. The system suggests specific actions, including dynamic lane closures, optimized rerouting and dispatching appropriate emergency resources. IncidentResponseGPT employs the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank generated response plans based on criteria like impact minimization and resource efficiency based on their proximity to an human-proposed solution.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Traffic congestion caused by road incidents represents a critical challenge in urban environments, leading to a cascade of detrimental impacts. Increased travel times, elevated pollution levels, and significant economic losses due to delays are just a few of the consequences faced by commuters and cities alike. While existing traffic management centers (TMCs) employ a mix of automated and manual processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>, these systems often struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and real-time demands of today’s traffic conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Addressing this critical need, we introduce IncidentResponseGPT, a novel system designed to revolutionize traffic incident response by leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional approaches, IncidentResponseGPT goes beyond simple automation. It analyzes real-time traffic incident reports and integrates region-specific operational guidelines to rapidly generate adaptable response plans. This empowers traffic management authorities with a proactive and intelligent tool to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their incident response strategies. This is achieved by incorporating a Generative AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> with traffic incident reports and area-specific operational guidelines.</p>

However, these models often struggle with real-time data integration and may lack the domain-specific knowledge required for accurate traffic incident management. Similarly, existing AI-based traffic management systems often rely on techniques like Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) or Bayesian Theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>. While these approaches have shown some success, they often struggle with the scalability and adaptability required for real-time incident response. CBR systems are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of historical cases, which can limit their effectiveness in novel situations. Bayesian methods, while powerful, can become computationally expensive in real-time scenarios, especially with large datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">ChatGPT previously has been explored for its capabilities in natural disaster management and demonstrate the applicability of LLM models in simplifying and accelerating the disaster management process through stages such as pre-disaster, during-disaster, and post-disaster scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>. These models prove effective in generating rapid response plans and disseminating crucial information during the event, with inherent limitations concerning real-time data processing and professional accuracy. The model addresses the limitations in real-time data handling and expert-level accuracy in complex disaster management scenarios. Also, a recently proposed DisasterResponseGPT framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> relies on LLMs to generate rapid action plans in disaster situations with limitations in handling visual and real-time data inputs. The discussion on using simulation models like Visual Interactive System for Transport Algorithms (VISTA) for simulating traffic conditions and test incident management strategies further underscores the benefits of dynamic modeling in responding to varying traffic conditions effectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>.

The integration of real-time data, the need for continuous model training, and the development of robust frameworks to handle complex emergency situations are recurrent themes across studies. As indicated by safety analytics in transport and construction sectors, there remains a crucial gap in applying AI to dynamically interpret complex environmental data sets and interact seamlessly across diverse operational platforms.</p>

The authors proposed a transition towards more adaptive models, capable of real-time adjustments in response strategies based on live data inputs. Key challenges identified include the ethical implications which remain paramount as these technologies become more relevant in critical areas affecting public safety of predictive policing and the limitations of current technology in accurately modeling complex urban behaviors. Current study aims to address AI capabilities with a consideration of ethical implications, striving for transparency and reliability of AI-driven methodology in traffic incident management. The application of dynamic resource allocation has been demonstrated in a similar case of response planning: crime response, with strategies like predictive analytics and hotspot policing gaining prominence. The continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) uses real-time crime data to optimize police patrol allocations, significantly improving response times in urban scenarios by minimizing the duration between crime occurrence and police arrival.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p4.1">We use ”Traffic Incident Management Handbook” as incident response guidelines. These guidelines were prepared for the Federal Highway Administration in November 2000, serve as a comprehensive guide for agencies involved in managing traffic incidents on public roadways. It targets two key audiences: 1) Managers responsible for developing and improving incident management programs, 2) Field Practitioners tasked with the day-to-day execution of these programs. The handbook addresses a wide range of topics related to incident management, including: 1) definitions for incident management, outlines its significance, and identifies the key agencies involved, 2) organization, planning, and design of an Incident Management, 3) provides a step-by-step process for establishing or enhancing programs, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, data analysis, goal setting, and evaluation, 4) outlines operational and technical approaches to improving the incident management process with the mention of specific techniques and strategies for each stage of incident management, such as detection, verification, motorist information, response, site management, traffic management, and clearance, 5) combines process-oriented guidance for program development with a toolbox of strategies and techniques applicable to real-world incident response.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p5.1">Within our framework, these guidelines pre-processed using Generative AI models to extract key instructions related to incident severity estimation, responder safety, traffic control, and information dissemination. The page length of these guidelines is 106 pages excluding references. These extracted guidelines are then converted into a structured format. These steps are necessary to allow the AI model to utilize instructions effectively with the consideration for inherent limitation for context window of Generative AI models.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p6.1">In a real-world implementation, IncidentResponseGPT has a property of high adaptability and scalability to available data sources due to its inherent ability to process any information represented as text. This could potentially allow the system to continuously adapt its response plan based on real-time updates from the field, traffic sensors, and other data sources.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p1.1">We use Generative AI (in our case - ChatGPT) within a framework that can generate the response plans based on accident description by learning from incident response guidelines (see Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Methodology and Data flow ‣ IncidentResponseGPT: Generating Traffic Incident Response Plans with Generative Artificial Intelligence"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The model generates informed action plans for traffic incidents using collected incident data and response guidelines, utilizing a comprehensive database of incidents and responsive measures. The system is to be made adaptable and reliable to incorporate various guidelines and verify positive impact on traffic flow using traffic simulation based on generated response plans.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p2.1">The core of the IncidentResponseGPT system is powered by a generative language model like OpenAI ChatGPT / Google Gemini, capable of producing dynamic traffic incident response plans. The response plans can not only be based on incoming incident data adhering to regional-specific incident response guidelines, but also real-time feedback from an operator and the current and progressive state of the traffic incident. This adaptability enhances the flexibility and situational appropriateness of the response plans, leading to improved traffic safety, reduction of congestion, and ultimately, lesser economic and environmental impacts of traffic incidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p3.1">To facilitate transparency of decision-making process, IncidentResponseGPT provides a Chain-of-thought visualization. This visualization highlights which instructions from the handbook were prioritized and how they influenced the specific actions within the response plan. For example, the system might show that the decision to prioritize a nearby tow truck was based on the guideline emphasizing the rapid clearance of blocked lanes.</p>

We call this process as ’Guideline Synthesis’, which result can be ‘plugged-into’ the AI system to generate incident response according to specific guidelines. It may be useful in comparison of response guidelines across various countries, while traffic simulation will provide quantifiable results of each response strategy effectiveness from different countries. The structure of our AI system allows to generate novel rules of incident response, perform various operations of modification of such rules, which can also be employed to enhance traffic systems in the future. Also, we use Countrywise Traffic Accident data set, which contains extensive descriptions of traffic accident variables. Also, Caltrans PeMS provides the incident timeline for each incident description which can be used in the development of real-time incident response system.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">The core operation of guideline synthesis procedure consists of multiple chunk processing and synthesis cycles (S-cycle). This procedure can be used as a component of a larger chain-of-thought schema and allows to process large amounts of text. S-cycle consists of the following steps (see Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4 Guideline synthesis ‣ IncidentResponseGPT: Generating Traffic Incident Response Plans with Generative Artificial Intelligence"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>):</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.I1.i1.p1.1">Text Chunking: The first step involves breaking down the given full text of incident response guidelines (guidelines can be extensive and include up to 300 pages) into manageable segments, or ”chunks,” to facilitate processing. This step acknowledges the limitations in processing capacity of generative models for large texts and ensures that each segment can be individually summarized. For our current research, the size of these chunks is defined at 6000 tokens to address limited token space of various LLM models.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p6.1">OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini were used to generate an incident response plan according to synthesized guideline table and accident description (see Table <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4 Guideline synthesis ‣ IncidentResponseGPT: Generating Traffic Incident Response Plans with Generative Artificial Intelligence"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).
ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot provided a closely aligned response plan with partial ramp closure, speed limit reduction, and deployment of tow trucks and cleanup crews, closely mirroring the guidelines for a “Moderate” severity incident involving a truck. Google Gemini, while suggesting immediate safety measures, seems slightly less detailed in specifying the sequential steps or acknowledging the cleanup process which might be necessary for such incidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p7.1">Both ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot demonstrated a higher level of detail in their response plans, matching the granular approach recommended in the provided traffic incident mitigation strategies. Google Gemini focused on broad strokes, which could be interpreted as a more general approach suited for a quick initial response but less detailed for full incident management.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p8.1">The equipment recommendations from ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were closely aligned with synthesized guidelines for handling an incident involving a stalled or overturned truck, demonstrating a strong adherence to the predefined response planning table.

</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p9">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p9.1">ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot both adhered closely to the provided guidelines, with a comprehensive and detailed approach to incident response, including both immediate safety measures and subsequent actions for traffic management and site clearance. Google Gemini, while adhering to the safety-first principle, could have expanded on the follow-up actions and detailed equipment use, offering a slightly less detailed plan when compared directly with the predefined traffic incident mitigation strategies. No model significantly diverged from the framework; however, the differences is in the level of detail and granularity in the action plans and equipment listings, with ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot providing a more in-depth, scenario-specific response.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p10">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p10.1">In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of the response strategies suggested by three different AI technologies—ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. This evaluation, while insightful, should be noted as a brief human assessment of the responses generated by these systems. There is notable consistency in the actions recommended by ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, both advocating for partial closure, speed limit reduction, and the deployment of tow trucks and cleanup crews. Conversely, Google Gemini’s strategy includes the deployment of an Incident Response Vehicle, temporary lane closure, and the use of Variable Message Signs (VMS), indicative of a more general approach targeted at immediate safety. ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot provide specific actions with clear implementation steps, emphasizing a structured approach to incident management. Google Gemini, while also actionable, presents more general guidelines. All three AIs generally align with predefined guidelines, though nuances exist. ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot closely follow these guidelines, while Google Gemini shows slight divergence, particularly in its omission of detailed cleanup advice, opting instead for more generalized response actions. This qualitative assessment underscores the difference in AI-generated strategies by various LLM models and the importance of this consideration for optimal real-world implementations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">During the incident management, decision-makers are frequently confronted with the need to evaluate and select from a multitude of response actions under conditions of uncertainty and time constraints. The commonly used method is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) which serves as a robust multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool that assists in organizing and analyzing these complex decisions. By breaking down the decision-making problem into a hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub-problems, AHP enables decision-makers to systematically evaluate the relative importance of various criteria and actions. While the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides a structured approach for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), in this study, we leverage the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.18550v3#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite> method to compare incident response strategies. TOPSIS is another robust MCDM technique that ranks alternatives based on their relative closeness to an ideal solution. Unlike AHP, which involves pairwise comparisons and eigenvector calculations, TOPSIS evaluates alternatives based on their geometric distance to a positive ideal solution (PIS) and a negative ideal solution (NIS).</p>

For example, abscence of action ”Deploy IRV” can have a significant impact on efficiency of a plan while its abscence in linguistic metrics will be similar to abscence of any other words (like notifying social media). In other words, linguistic metrics may assign different weights to actions based on linguistic features in regards to impact of these actions.

This allows for plan comparison with consideration of impact and resource engagement. Each plan for evaluation will have a score assigned by human based on incident response guidelines. It will represent a base value of each plan. Further, response plans produced by Generative AI models will be produced and compared to this value. This way we define the method and the metric for comparison of generated incident response plans. Each comparison table contains priority indexes and not actual relevance rate.</p>

Each action in the response plan is assigned a weight, reflecting its importance. The table evaluates four plans: the Ideal Plan, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. Each plan’s effectiveness in implementing various actions is scored as either 0 (action not taken) or 1 (action taken). The total score for each plan is calculated by summing the product of the weights and the respective scores. The Ideal Plan, with a total score of 6.745, represents the optimal set of actions. The obtained value allows to calculate difference in effectivenes of response plans.</p>

The binary arrays indicate whether a specific action (each digit representing an action) was triggered (1) or not (0) by each model for the given accidents. The comparison and observations were derived from larger sample of 10 incident plans.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.p5.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx2.p5.1.1">Observations:</span> 1. Gemini 1.5 Pro Model: Tends to include too many actions in response to the accidents. For many accident IDs, Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently triggers all actions (indicated by arrays filled mostly with 1s), which suggests an over-reaction or lack of discrimination between necessary and unnecessary actions. 2. GPT-4 Model: Responses appear more nuanced and selective. The binary arrays generated by GPT-4 show greater alignment with the ”Ideal Plan” relative to other models. For many accidents, the actions taken by GPT-4 closely match those recommended by the ideal response plan, indicating a higher level of accuracy and potentially more optimal decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.p6.1">GPT-4 Original (GPT-4o) and ChatGPT 3.5 also show a reasonable degree of alignment with the Ideal Plan but are less consistent compared to GPT-4.
Gemini 1.5 Flash displays a tendency to over-respond, albeit not as extensively as Gemini 1.5 Pro. The variations across models suggest differing degrees of precision and over-inclusivity, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate language model for generating optimal response plans in accident scenarios.
Overall, the table illustrates that while the Gemini 1.5 Pro model often triggers excessive actions, GPT-4’s responses are well-calibrated and closely match the ideal response strategies for the given accidents. This makes GPT-4 a potentially more reliable choice for generating effective response plans.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx3.p1.1">This research demonstrates that generative AI, specifically GPT-4, holds significant potential for revolutionizing traffic incident management. Our analysis reveals notable differences in the accuracy and effectiveness of various language models when generating response plans. GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models, generating plans that closely align with human-proposed solutions. For example, in a scenario involving a multi-vehicle collision during peak hours (Incident ID A-4227983), GPT-4 accurately identified the need for temporary lane closures, VMS deployment to warn drivers, and quick clearance protocols. This contrasted with Gemini 1.5 Pro, which, despite recognizing the need for response vehicles, neglected critical actions like VMS deployment, leading to a less effective response strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx3.p2.1">While promising, we acknowledge that deploying AI in traffic management presents challenges such as potential data or guideline bias, the need for continuous model adaptation and validation, and ethical considerations surrounding automated decision-making. Addressing these challenges requires a complex approach that involves collaboration between AI researchers, traffic management authorities, and policymakers.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx3.p3.1">Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI-driven traffic management cannot be overstated. IncidentResponseGPT’s ability to swiftly generate informed, adaptable, and transparent response plans has potential for far-reaching implications for improving traffic flow, safety, and reducing the economic and environmental impact of road incidents. This research serves as a crucial step toward realizing the full potential of AI in creating more efficient and resilient urban environments. We encourage further exploration and development of AI-driven solutions to address complex challenges in transportation and beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx3.p4.1">In the future research, the produced response plans are expected to have a formal structure to facilitate validation using traffic simulation. Also, each response will include references to specific parts of guidelines and Chain-of-Tought process.</p>
