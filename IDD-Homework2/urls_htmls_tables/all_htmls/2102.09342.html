<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Depression is one of the most common mental illness problems, and the symptoms shown by patients are not consistent, making it difficult to diagnose in the process of clinical practice and pathological research.
Although researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning needs to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms clinical application.
To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of patients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and diagnose depression.
First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning framework using multi-source data,which can extend any traditional machine learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or parties.
Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of inconsistent time series of multi-view data.
Finally, we compare the federated framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss the related results.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Depression is a very common disease in real life.
More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At present, the diagnosis of depression depends almost entirely on the subjective judgment of the doctor through communication with the patient and the relevant questionnaires filled out.
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> are commonly used evaluation criteria for doctors when diagnosing depression.
In order to better help doctors diagnose depression, researchers analyze patient data by introducing machine learning technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.But when using machine learning technology, there is a contradiction between the performance of the model and the protection of data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">First, the quality of the model trained by machine learning is closely related to the amount of data.
Deep Neural Network (DNN) has achieved good results in a variety of medical applications, but it highly depends on the amount and diversity of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Although Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a scheme to avoid data privacy leakage under centralized learning, hospitals need to protect the privacy of patients’ diagnosis data, so different medical institutions cannot gather and share data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which greatly affects the accuracy of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
For example, in the work of electrocardiogram, because a single medical institution cannot collect enough high-quality data, the predictive ability of the model cannot achieve the role of clinical assistance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Second, although there are many machine learning algorithms that involve privacy protection, it is difficult to achieve good training results.
There are many machine learning application scenarios for privacy protection, such as recommendation systems and face recognition.
However, the privacy protection machine learning method needs to increase the noise according to the sensitivity of the algorithm’s intermediate product, so under the limited privacy budget, the prediction performance of the privacy algorithm is often poor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Third, due to the huge gap between various medical institutions, the patient data they have varies greatly.
In order to deal with various situations, algorithms and software are required to have a high generalization ability, and it is difficult for the model to obtain sufficient accuracy and specificity without data exchange.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above limitations, in 2016, Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a method called federated learning to break the problem of medical data silos due to patient data privacy.
Each medical institution does not need to centralize patient data to train a machine learning model. Instead, it aggregates the trained model in one place and uses federated averaging technology to continuously optimize the model so that the data can be available to all health care facilities.
However, most of the existing research using the federated learning framework in the medical field is based on the existing data of hospitals.
It mainly includes the diagnosis of the characteristics of patients with specific diseases, reducing the cost of diagnosis and treatment, medical image processing and other issues
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
As mobile devices become more and more popular, smart phones, bracelets and other devices are also recording users’ information all the time.
According to existing researches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, as one of the most important tools for information transmission in patients’ lives, mobile phones can also be an important data source for disease prediction.
We believe that keyboard keystrokes, such as the interval between two keystrokes, can be used as a form of biometric identification to predict depression by analyzing the keystroke habits of patients with depression.
The typing speed of depression patients is usually different from that of normal people, which may be caused by emotional instability during the onset of the disease <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our work uses a virtual keyboard customized for mobile phones to collect metadata (including key letters, special characters, and phone accelerometer values).
Using &gt;1.3 million keypresses from 20 users and each users who additionally completed at least 1 Patient Health Questionnaire.
We regard the user’s keypresses at least five seconds apart as the beginning, and no operation after five seconds of the last keypress as a session carry out.
The duration of the session is usually within 1 minute.
We use federated learning architecture at the session level to model DeepMood <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a deep learning architecture based on late fusion.
However, in real life, the amount of data held by different medical institutions is very different, the number of medical institutions in different regions is also different.
To this end, we divided our work into two parts.
Firstly, we distribute the data to different parties for training according to the IID(Independent and Identically Distributed) method, but the amount of data that each party has during each training is not the same, and the number of parties participating in the training is also different each time.
This setting simulates the real situation in different regions and different medical institutions.
At the same time, in order to verify the influence of federated learning on model training, we simulated a data island environment and set up local training for each party that did not participate in federated learning.
Furthermore, we assign the data to each party according to non-IID, and discuss the influence of non-IID on the prediction results.
The experimental results show that the model prediction accuracy reaches 85.13% in the case of IID and 76.95% in the case of non-IID.</p>

Huang L et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> improved the performance of federated learning for predicting mortality and length of stay by using feature autoencoders and patient clustering.
However, the method of combining federated learning and multi-view data in existing research is still in the development stage.
Adrian Flanagan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed the federated multi-view matrix factorization method and address cold-start problem.
Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed FL-MV-DSSM, which is the first general content-based joint multi-view framework, which successfully extended traditional federated learning to federated multi-view learning.
Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed the FedMVT algorithm for semi-supervised learning, which can improve the performance of vertical federated learning with limited overlapping samples.

<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated privacy protection.</span>
There are three main ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to protect data privacy in the federated learning framework: Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMC) and Differential Privacy Mechanism (DP) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Secure multi-party computing mainly uses secure communication and encryption algorithms to protect the model aggregation security of different participants in the federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Since the federated framework does not need to aggregate data but transmits gradients or model parameters, SMC only needs to encrypt related parameters, which saves a lot of encryption calculation cost. However, the improved strategy based on SMC still adds extra time cost compared with the traditional federated framework. How to balance the time cost and the loss of data value over time has become a problem to be solved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy protects data privacy by adding noise to the data source, while ensuring that the loss of data quality is controllable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. By adding noise to the models or gradients uploaded by participants, the contribution of personal data in the dataset is masked to prevent reverse data leakage.
At the same time, because of the problem that the data after adding noise is still close to the original data, Sun L et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> use local differential privacy and noise-free differential privacy mechanisms to decrease the risk of information exposure.
However, the introduction of differential privacy may reduce the accuracy of the global model, and it will be difficult for the central server to measure the contribution of each party to encourage different parties to participate in the federated.</p>

In the federated framework, each party can homomorphically encrypt the parameters they want to upload, and the central server can complete the aggregation process of the federated model without decryption. Since data and models will not be transmitted in plain text, there will be no leakage of the original data level. However, local party encryption and decryption operations increase computing power consumption, and the transmission of ciphertext will also increase additional communication cost.</p>

Each medical institution will first use its own local data to train and test the effect.
The results obtained at this time are generally difficult to use as a reference for the diagnosis of depression.
Each participant will cooperate with other medical institutions for federated study and training, and in this process, new medical institutions will continue to participate.
Without reducing the total number of communication rounds, increase the degree of parallelism to test the changes in the prediction effect.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Due to the privacy issues of patient health data stored in hospitals, we cannot use these data for centralized learning.
Google has proposed a new framework called federated learning.
During the training of the federated learning model, the data owned by each hospital participating in the model training collaboration can be saved locally without uploading.
Each hospital uses its own data to download the model from the server for training, and upload the trained model or gradient to the server for aggregation, and then the server sends the aggregated model or gradient information to each hospital.
Considering the communication burden and connection reliability and other issues, we adopt the model average method for training.

<p id="S3.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we use the federated learning framework to focus on studying the influence of participants and data volume under IID data and the extreme distribution of non-IID data on the results of emotion prediction through multi-views heterogeneous data collected on the mobile terminal.
However, in the actual use of the federated learning framework, there are also such issues as the flexibility and stability of party joining and quitting at any time, the party’s dynamic increase and change with the increase of patients, the statistical contribution of party to the model and the design of corresponding incentive mechanism.
Although these issues are beyond the scope of our existing work, we still deal with non-IID data and party participation stability.
We specified the number of parties participating in the experiment.
The datasets owned by each client have been determined before training, and we fixed the parties participating in the training update in advance to stabilize the final training effect after each experiment.</p>

We assume that the hospital allocates a special mobile device to each user to collect alphanumeric characters, special characters, and accelerometer values used in the conversation, and the hospital has weekly HDRS test scores for patients.
Due to the particularity of the diagnosis of depression, patients may go to multiple hospitals to try and seek treatment, and some hospitals may have the same patient data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The data used in the experiment comes from a real observation study of a free mobile app by BiAffect.
In the data collection stage, the researchers provide the users with a special Android smartphone.
The mobile phone uses a customized virtual keyboard to replace the default keyboard, so as to collect the metadata input by the user without affecting the operation in the background.
The collected content of the keyboard includes data such as the user key input time, the number of keystrokes and the phone accelerometer value.
The three types of metadata we use are as follows:</p>

After the data collected by the study participants, according to the control of extreme subjects and normal users.
There are 6 participants suffered from bipolar I disorder, including severe episodes ranging from bipolar disorder to depression, 6 participants suffered from bipolar II disorder, including clinical manifestations were mildly elevated mood between mild manic episodes and severe episodes, and 8 participants were diagnosed as normal subjects.Since the evaluation process only relies on the communication between the patient and the doctor and the indicators given by the evaluation scale, the results of the diagnosis are not necessarily reliable Therefore, we try to predict the occurrence of depression from an objective perspective by recording real-time data of patients.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We set the parameters based on experience and some experimental comparisons, including the number of communication rounds, the number of local epochs, batch size, learning rate, and dropout rate.
We consider sessions with the HDRS score between 0 and 7 (inclusive) as negative samples (normal) and those with HDRS greater than or equal to 8 as positive samples (from mild to severe depression).
Our code is open-sourced at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RingBDStack/Fed_mood" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/RingBDStack/Fed_mood</a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to study the influence of local epochs parameters, we evenly distribute the training data set to 8 participants for testing.
The results are shown in the Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table II ‣ IV-B Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedMood: Federated Learning on Mobile Health Data for Mood Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, we can find: (1) As the number of communication rounds increases, the accuracy rate shows a trend of rising and then a slight decrease.
(2) Our work is inconsistent with the results of Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
A large number of local epochs can significantly improve the effect of federated learning.
However, when epochs = 20, the accuracy of DMVM in any communication round shows a downward trend.
These results show that increasing the local epoch can make the training more stable and speed up the convergence speed, but it may not make the global model converge to a higher accuracy level.
That is, over-optimizing the local datasets may cause performance loss.
(3) In the first 300 periods, the fusion efficiency of DFM is higher than that of DNN and DMVM, which shows the improvement effect of the fusion layer, and DFM achieve better local minima of loss functions in some results.
Compared with centralized learning, due to the sharp reduction of local data, the effect of DMVM fusion of multi-view and multi-level features will be affected to a certain extent.
Because the three models get different results when the local epochs are 15 and 20, we perform the parameters separately settings, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table I ‣ IV-B Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedMood: Federated Learning on Mobile Health Data for Mood Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

Since local training has no interactive learning process and the amount of data owned by each participant is constant, the final result has always been between 73% and 75% fluctuation.
In most cases, CDS can achieve the best prediction effect, but the best effect of DMVM model using CIIL can reach 85.29%, which is about 18% higher than local training without updating model weight.</p>

The accuracy of the local training without weight update and FedAvg training is increasing at the same time.
When the amount of data for each party is small (data&lt;1000), the improvement effect of FedAvg compared with local training can reach up to 16.7%.
When the amount of data for each participant is large enough (data=3000), the FedAvg enhancement effect is up to 10.5%, which has a small difference from the result of CIIL.</p>

The nature of the extreme distribution of non-IID data is the reason for the decline in prediction effect.
We also find that the prediction effects of the two models that do not use nonlinear functions for feature interaction are significantly different under non-IID data.
Due to the large difference in the number of patient data owned by each party and the completely inconsistent patient data types, the second-order feature interaction failed to integrate all features well, and the log also showed that its prediction accuracy fluctuates more than DMVM.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the experimental results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table III ‣ IV-C3 Experiment Result ‣ IV-C IID Experiments ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedMood: Federated Learning on Mobile Health Data for Mood Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, when the amount of data held by each party is constant, we can find that CDS can always maintain the best effect on DNN and DFM models in most cases, but in the DMVM model, CIIL has the best result. We can see from Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table IV ‣ IV-C3 Experiment Result ‣ IV-C IID Experiments ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedMood: Federated Learning on Mobile Health Data for Mood Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> that when the amount of data is 1000, the data of each party is not repeated, and the federated learning framework has achieved the best results under the three models. When the amount of data is 1500, the model is affected by repeated data for the first time. Instead, the prediction performance of FedAVG declined slightly, and the prediction effect of CIIL is still rising.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since the prediction accuracy of CIIL mostly depends on the effect of the last trained party model, we guess that repeated input data will seriously affect the fusion interaction mode of the multi-view machine layer. Compared with CDS, the last participation of CIIL has less repeated data, and the federated framework will be affected by repeated data due to the last round of global model weight update. Therefore, CIIL is less affected than these two methods, and the best accuracy result can eventually reach 85.29%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For non-IID experiments, CDS can still maintain the prediction accuracy of about 83%, while federated learning and CIIL both have an inadequate accuracy drop. However, under the non-IID setting, the federated learning framework surpasses CIIL on the DMVM model, which proves the superiority of the multi-view machine layer under the federated framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">At the same time, for the non-IID experiment, we also find that in one hospital, the accuracy of the validation set is distributed between 50% and 75% during the training process, while the training logs of other hospitals show that the accuracy of the validation set is almost above 90% after each round of local training.
However, we have not yet dealt with the weights of participants with poor performance in the training.
Our next work is to consider constructing an appropriate incentive mechanism to weaken the influence of participants with poor contribution on the overall prediction effect, so as to fully reduce the influence of non-IID data on the model weight.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in order to test the influence of different views on the model prediction effect, as shown in Fig <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedMood: Federated Learning on Mobile Health Data for Mood Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we visualize the data of each view.
We find that the distribution of Spec. is too scattered, and it is difficult to distinguish normal people from patients in special operations such as backspace, space, and keyboard switching.
Alph. and Accel. have better categorizable results from a single view. This also illustrates from the other hand that there are obvious differences in typing patterns between normal people and depressed patients, including the duration of keystrokes.
In summary, it is necessary to merge data from different views as input.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning plays a key role in solving the problem of data islands.
In the problem of data islands, user privacy and data security are very important.
In this work, we use the data records generated by the user when typing on the mobile phone and the user’s HDRS score to predict depression through the DeepMood architecture.
For IID data, with different amounts of data, the accuracy of federated learning is about 10%-15% higher than that of local training without weight update.
For non-IID data, accuracy is only reduced by 13% at most. From the perspective of protecting user privacy, this is completely acceptable.</p>
