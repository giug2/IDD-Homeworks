<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, innovative model aggregation methods based on knowledge distillation (KD) have been proposed for federated learning (FL). These methods not only improved the robustness of model aggregation over heterogeneous learning environment, but also allowed training heterogeneous models on client devices. However, the scalability of existing methods is not satisfactory, because the training cost on the server increases with the number of clients, which limits their application in large scale systems. Furthermore, the ensemble of existing methods is built from a set of client models initialized from the same checkpoint, causing low diversity. In this paper, we propose a scalable and diversity-enhanced federated distillation scheme, FedSDD, which decouples the training complexity from the number of clients to enhance the scalability, and builds the ensemble from a set of aggregated models with enhanced diversity. In particular, the teacher model in FedSDD is an ensemble built by a small group of aggregated (global) models, instead of all client models, such that the computation cost will not scale with the number of clients. Furthermore, to enhance diversity, FedSDD only performs KD to enhance one of the global models, i.e., the <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">main global model</span>, which improves the performance of both the ensemble and the main global model. While partitioning client model into more groups allow building an ensemble with more aggregated models, the convergence of individual aggregated models will be slow down. We introduce the temporal ensembling which leverage the issues, and provide significant improvement with the heterogeneous settings. Experiment results show that FedSDD outperforms other FL methods, including FedAvg and FedDF, on the benchmark datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">

Recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">12</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>]</cite> adopted knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite> for model aggregation to tackle data and device heterogeneity issues. Such distillation-based aggregation methods have been shown to outperform weight averaging methods like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite>. However, existing works utilized all client models to build the ensemble for KD, leading to poor scalability in real world applications, where a large number, e.g., thousands, of clients are available. Furthermore, existing methods built the ensemble by client models that were initialized from the same global model, which may have low diversity and thus limit the performance of the ensemble.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the above issues, we propose a new algorithm named Federated Scalable and Diversity-enhanced Distillation (FedSDD). The key innovations of FedSDD include:
(i). Improving the scalability of distillation-based aggregation by building the ensemble (i.e. the teacher model) from a set of aggregated models, each of which is obtained by performing weight averaging over a sub-group of client models. As a result, the computation complexity for distillation at the server is independent of the number of clients but dictated by the number of aggregated models.
(ii). Maximizing the capacity of the ensemble and the global model by enhancing the diversity among the compositing models of the ensemble. This is achieved by training multiple global models simultaneously, but only transferring the knowledge from the ensemble to one of them.
(iii). Ideally, a larger ensemble, i.e., more involved models, has better capacity. However, in the scheme of leveraging aggregated models as an ensemble ((i).), this results in fewer client models per group, implicating a trade-off between individual global model convergence and ensemble capacity. We propose alleviating this issue by introducing the temporal ensembling.
Furthermore, FedSDD has favorable properties in terms of efficiency and privacy. In particular, FedSDD can achieve higher efficiency by parallel training across the server and client sides. Different from existing distillation-based methods, FedSDD does not require accessing client models, which provides further protection to the user privacy. Experiment results show that FedSDD can achieve the superior results on CIFAR10/100 datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">16</span></a>]</cite>, especially when the data of different clients are not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID).</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated learning.</span> Training deep learning models require a large amount of data. In many practical scenarios, e.g. healthcare, data are distributed over the user devices, and these user data may not be able to be shared due to privacy regulations and/or communication constraints. To tackle the above issues, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> was proposed to train a shared model, normally referred to as the global model, by utilizing the data distributed on the client devices without data sharing. The simplest approach is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite>, which performs multiple epochs of local training on the client side and then aggregates the learned models on the server side by weight averaging. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> also utilizes weight averaging to perform model aggregation, but with added regularization to tackle the data heterogeneity issue.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Knowledge distillation in federated learning.</span> KD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite> has been proposed in deep learning to compress deep neural networks. Student models, which typically have a smaller size, are forced to mimic the output of the teacher model. In some recent works, KD has been applied in FL with two lines of approaches. The first utilizes distillation to perform model aggregation. For example, FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>]</cite> and FedBE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">4</span></a>]</cite> utilized client models as the teacher model to update the global model on the server, and the purpose is to improve the model aggregation performance with heterogeneous data. Some other works, including FedFTG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>]</cite> and Fed-ET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>]</cite>, utilized distillation for the same purpose, but in a different setting, i.e. in a data-free or model heterogeneous environment. The second approach shares model predictions between clients and the server for training purposes. For example, in FD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">13</span></a>]</cite>, model predictions were shared between clients to regularize the local training. In FedAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>]</cite>, model outputs of the clients were used to train a global model on the server through distillation.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on distillation-based model aggregation for FL. The proposed FedSDD utilizes distillation to perform model aggregation, and can be classified into the first approach. In particular, FedSDD first performs local training and weight averaging within multiple groups clients to obtain multiple global models. Then, it builds an ensemble as the teacher model and enhance one of the global model via distillation. The key innovations lie in the enhanced scalability due to the way of building of ensemble and the improved diversity across the compositing models of the ensemble by the designated KD to only one of the global models. Furthermore, the process in the first step is fully modularized, such that averaging based methods like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> can be directly applied. As a result, the proposed framework can easily adopt existing FL algorithms for further enhancement.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noticing that, the above workflow performs weights broadcasting, local training, and aggregation in different groups, independently. The workflow within one group is essentially the same as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite>, and shares similar procedures as many common FL algorithms. Thus, the actual implementation can be easily replaced by other federated learning algorithms, to bring additional benefits, e.g. replacing FedAvg by FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> to tackle the Non-IID issue by introducing regularization. Although FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>]</cite> has demonstrated a similar compatibility, FedSDD further improves it by the full modularization of the weight averaging and local training step. As a result, the direct access to the client models are not required by the server. For example, by utilizing secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>]</cite>, the server can obtain the results of aggregation but without accessing the individual client models, which provide better privacy protection to the clients. In this paper, our focus is not on the local training and weight averaging step, thus we use FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> as the default option. In the experiments, we will demonstrate that FedSDD works well with different alternative FL algorithms.</p>

To enhance the ensemble capability without sacrificing the convergence of individual global models, we propose to build the ensemble by leveraging multiple checkpoints of different training rounds. Intuitively, global models from consecutive rounds were trained based on the data from different subsets of the clients. Thus, ensembling global models from multiple checkpoints of different rounds can emulate the case where more clients are participating. This allows us to build a larger ensemble without slowing down individual models’ convergence.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in section <a href="#S3.SS1.SSS1" title="3.1.1 Local training and weight averaging ‣ 3.1 Overview ‣ 3 Scalable and diversity-enhanced distillation for model aggregation ‣ FedSDD: Scalable and Diversity-enhanced Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1.1</span></a>, the local training and model aggregation step of FedSDD can be replaced by many different existing methods. We evaluate the compatibility of FedSDD with different choices of local training scheme by combining FedSDD with FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> (default option in this paper), FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite>, and SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">14</span></a>]</cite>.
The results in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1 Compatibility of FedSDD with other FL algorithms ‣ 5 Ablation Studies ‣ FedSDD: Scalable and Diversity-enhanced Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (left, with 8 clients) show that FedSDD is compatible with FedProx and the combination achieves better performance with high degree of data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the combination of FedSDD and SCAFFOLD did not improve the performance under the concerned setting. We conjectured this may be due to the fact that the number of clients per global model is only 2 in FedSDD which is too small for SCAFFOLD. We thus performed additional experiments with 20 clients per round, i.e. the number of clients per global models became 5, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1 Compatibility of FedSDD with other FL algorithms ‣ 5 Ablation Studies ‣ FedSDD: Scalable and Diversity-enhanced Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (right). With these settings, the combination of FedSDD and SCAFFOLD achieved much higher accuracy than the stand-alone FedSDD and SCAFFOLD. The above results suggest that FedSDD is flexible with the implementation of the local training scheme.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FedSDD, distillation is performed to enhance only the main global model, which enhances the diversity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed comparison between different ways of distillation: (i). A basic KD scheme, which utilizes the ensemble as the teacher model and all global models are trained by mimicking the output of the ensemble. Note that we fixed the weights of the ensemble during the distillation process. This is similar to the heterogeneous version of FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>]</cite>, where all global models are improved by KD; (ii). A scheme following Codistillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">1</span></a>]</cite>, which skips the distillation in the early rounds of training, such that the models will not learn from each other at the beginning to maintain potentially higher diversity. We set the number of warm-up epochs to 20/40; and (iii). The proposed diversity-enhanced distillation, where only the main global model is enhanced by KD.</p>

In fact, the ensemble trained by the proposed scheme obtained the best result for all the cases, which is close to the ensemble without distillation. These observations support our expectation that diversity enhancing schemes can improve the performance of both the ensemble and the distilled global model.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed FedSSD, a distillation-based federated learning algorithm to tackle the limitation of existing KD-based FL algorithms for model aggregation. The proposed scheme is highly scalable as it utilizes multiple global models, instead of all client models, for building the ensemble. The ensemble in FedSSD has a better performance due to the diversity-enhancing KD scheme, which in turn improves the performance of the global model through KD. Furthermore, the main modules of FedSSD are compatible with different FL algorithms, whose adaptation can further improve the performance of FL systems.</p>

To fix the total computation workload, we set the number of rounds and the number of local epochs per round as 25/100/400 and 160/40/10, respectively. We also scaled the number of distillation steps to 20000/5000/1250. From Table <a href="#A1.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ A.1 Experiment with different communication intervals ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ FedSDD: Scalable and Diversity-enhanced Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, it can be observed that FedSDD performed better than FedAvg in all the cases, and achieved better results than FedDF in most of the cases. But, with 25 communication rounds, FedDF outperformed FedSDD. We expect this is due to the extremely small number of clients per global models in FedSDD, i.e. two clients per global models, which slowed down the convergence when the communication frequency is too low.</p>

In this example, we assume there are four clients, and only one is available at any given time. For the sake of simplicity, we further assume there are four global models for FedSSD and the main global model is always assigned to the first client. Under such circumstances, existing methods need to perform KD and local training sequentially, while FedSSD can perform them simultaneously to reduce the round time.</p>
