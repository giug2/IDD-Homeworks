<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), as a rapidly evolving privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, is a promising approach to enable edge intelligence in the emerging Industrial Metaverse. Even though many successful use cases have proved the feasibility of FL in theory, in the industrial practice of Metaverse, the problems of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, learning forgetting caused by streaming industrial data, and scarce communication bandwidth remain key barriers to realize practical FL. Facing the above three challenges simultaneously, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient system named <span id="id5.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> for incorporating practical FL into Industrial Metaverse. <span id="id5.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> reduces data heterogeneity through dynamic grouping and training mode conversion (<span id="id5.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Dynamic Sequential-to-Parallel Training, STP</span>). Then, it compensates for the forgotten knowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates classifier parameters (<span id="id5.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Semantic Compression and Compensation, SCC</span>). Finally, the network parameters of the feature extractor and classifier are synchronized in different frequencies (<span id="id5.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Layer-wise Alternative Synchronization Protocol, LASP</span>) to reduce communication costs. These techniques make FL more adaptable to the heterogeneous streaming data continuously generated by industrial equipment, and are also more efficient in communication than traditional methods (e.g., Federated Averaging). Extensive experiments have been conducted on the streamed non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset using 368 simulated devices. Numerical results show that <span id="id5.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> improves the classification accuracy by at least 6.4% compared with 8 benchmarks and saves both the overall runtime and transfer bytes by up to 98%, proving its superiority in precision and efficiency.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Known as “the successor of mobile Internet”, the concept of Metaverse<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has attracted growing attention in both academia and industry. As a future interaction paradigm that requires a rich variety of enabling technologies, Metaverse would revolutionize many domains and their applications work. One possible application could be in the field of the Smart Industry, also known as the Industrial Metaverse. In fact, the Industrial Metaverse is said to be the field closest to realizing Metaverse, and there are already some practices in real factories. For example, Nvidia Omniverse 6 allows BMW to integrate its brick-and-mortar car factory with Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robotics to improve its operation precision and flexibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the preliminary blueprint of the Industrial Metaverse, managers should be able to control real-world equipment to complete complex tasks, such as robotic arms, in a virtual world using advanced technologies such as VR. As one of the fundamental technologies in the Metaverse, Digital Twins<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> use sensors scattered all around to collect device data and synchronize to the virtual world in real time. This constant stream of data will be then analyzed by tools such as Machine Learning (ML) to assist managers in decision-making and realizing industrial automation. For example, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the most widely used ML tools, which helps managers to identify product information and equipment status more efficiently. As a distributed ML paradigm designed for a large number of edge devices and with privacy-preserving capabilities, Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is naturally a promising technique in this context. An illustration of the FL-assisted Industrial Metaverse is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ HFedMS: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics in Industrial Metaverse" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the fusion of FL and Industrial Metaverse is not a simple combination of technologies. Industrial Metaverse<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has extremely demanding requirements for edge intelligence, especially in terms of precision and efficiency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This poses great challenges from both data and system perspectives under the current industrial network architecture. Specifically, we summarize three main challenges below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">

<p id="S1.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.ix1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data Heterogeneity:</span>
The preference for different classes of data is inherent in every aspect of industrial manufacturing (e.g., among different types of sensors and different functional factories). As a necessary process, manufacturers (e.g., Toyota and Volkswagen) will always prescribe the naming and numbering rules of each component. For example, “026” and “034” represent four- and five-cylinder engines and are produced by factories A and B, respectively, and thus A will see more characters “2” and “6” than B. Such class biases in the data distribution are called data heterogeneity and have been shown to impair the precision of FL models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.ix2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Learning Forgetting:</span>
Real-time Digital Twins in Metaverse, combined with In-Memory Computing, enables instant dynamic analysis locally at sensors as streaming data flows in, and allows it to implement real-time industrial systems. However, most sensors have limited memory capacity and cannot store the complete stream of incoming data. For instance, an industrial embedded DDR5 RDIMM has a memory capacity of 16-32GB, but an application can generate gigabits of runtime logs per second. Therefore, old data should be erased from memory to store recent data. Under this paradigm, ML models tend to forget previously learned data knowledge, which is called catastrophic forgetting<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.ix3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limited Bandwidth:</span>
Wide wireless coverage is often required in open spaces such as mines and blasting sites. The cellular low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, including NarrowBand IoT, LTE-M, etc., feature long coverage range and low power consumption, and thus become especially favored by the industry. As a price, LPWAN has a low bit rate (e.g., up to 220kbps for NarrowBand IoT and up to 1Mbps for LTE-M<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>), and results in high latency when transmitting ML models and therefore becomes the efficiency bottleneck of FL.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Facing the above three challenges, some feasible solutions have already been proposed in the field of FL. However, unfortunately, they are studied separately for a certain challenge, and some are not applicable due to the strict constraints in industrial settings. For the problem of data heterogeneity, some efforts<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> use data augmentation to balance the number of samples in each category. These methods work well on static FL that traverses the local dataset multiple times, but are not suitable for industrial streaming data that can only be seen once. Moreover, the streaming data bring the learning forgetting problem. Related work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> on continual learning tries to alleviate forgetting by storing historical data, but the storage of a steady stream of industrial data puts great pressure on sensor memory. In terms of system efficiency, compression techniques such as network pruning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, quantization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and sparsification<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have been successful in reducing model size and easing communication burden. However, the pruning-based approaches (e.g., network slimming<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>) are data-dependent, which makes their pruned model structure oscillate when dealing with rapidly changing streaming data. The quantization- and sparsification-based approaches have limited compression rates without sacrificing accuracy, and will still burden the small-bandwidth LPWAN network, which requires further compression.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In order to meet the demanding requirements for precision and efficiency of the Industrial Metaverse, FL still lacks practical methods and algorithms to address these three challenges simultaneously. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel, high-performance and efficient system, named <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>. Firstly, <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> adopts a new concept of dynamic <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sequential-to-Parallel (STP)</span> mode to coordinate the training process between devices. Leveraging the robustness of sequential training to data heterogeneity, STP groups devices and encourages devices within each group to train the federated model sequentially, while devices between groups still run in the parallel mode. The grouping function is provided by a fast <span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Inter-Cluster Grouping (ICG)</span> algorithm, which outputs device groups with homogeneous data distribution. As training progresses, the number of groups increases, and the system training mode gradually transforms from sequential to fully parallel. Secondly, for the forgetting problem, <span id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> introduces a <span id="S1.p6.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Semantic Compression &amp; Compensation (SCC)</span> mechanism. The core idea is to store the compressed historical semantics extracted by the representation layer, which will be replayed and compensated and used to calibrate the classifier. Thirdly, a <span id="S1.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Layer-wise Alternative Synchronization Protocol (LASP)</span> is leveraged, which synchronizes the important but lightweight classifier parameters at a higher frequency to reduce the communication burden. These techniques are natively compatible with changing streaming data by design (Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ HFedMS: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics in Industrial Metaverse" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously address all three challenges of data heterogeneity, learning forgetting, and limited bandwidth under the strict constraints of the Industrial Metaverse.</p>

Federated Learning (FL), emerged as an advanced distributed ML paradigm that addresses data privacy breaches when working with a large number of smart edge devices, has become an indispensable underlying foundation for Metaverse. A lot of work has been done in FL in terms of efficiency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, security<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, etc., but statistical heterogeneity still remains an open problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the authors found that the drop in FL accuracy is caused by the divergence in class distributions between clients (i.e., non-i.i.d.), which can reach a 55% drop in the worst case. It motivated some efforts<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to balance local class distribution by sharing and augmenting data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, a proximal penalty term was added to the local loss function to constrain local models. Feature fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, weighted aggregation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, and adaptive optimizers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> are also promising directions in promoting convergence on non-i.i.d. data. Moreover, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed clustering-based approaches to remove heterogeneity between groups, with best-fit grouping strategies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and unique client selection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>

Online learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> is an ML technology that continuously learns new knowledge from a continuous stream of data (e.g., industrial sensing data), rather than requiring the entire dataset to be prepared in advance as in traditional offline learning. It is a natural trend to combine online learning and FL such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, however, the original purpose of online learning did not take into account catastrophic forgetting, where ML models may forget previously learned knowledge in later learning. This phenomenon was first discovered in the study of connectionist networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and has received increasing attention in recent years<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. To distinguish it from online learning, continual learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> (also incremental learning) was proposed as a subset of online learning that deals with catastrophic forgetting. For brevity, here we only discuss one of the mainstream directions, that is, data replay. A naive idea is to store the raw HD data and reuse it in later training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, but due to the small storage capacity of sensors, doing so will limit the learning ability and put high storage pressure on industrial devices. To this end, lighter and lower-dimensional information should be stored and used for replay. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> stored the activation map at some intermediate layer, and in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> used a standard variational autoencoder to recover past data from stored features. Nonetheless, as training progresses, the stored features may become outdated, but they did not incorporate compensation module to bridge this gap. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, an additional multi-layer perception was used to compensate for outdated features, but this approach increases model complexity and places more burden on devices.</p>

The basic hardware facilities include various types of smart sensors, LPWAN base stations, and an FL server in the cloud.
Smart sensors are advanced sensors capable of sensing, storing, processing, and transmitting streaming sensor data from surrounding objects.
As factory automation advances, more sophisticated sensors are driving industrial manufacturing (e.g. smart cameras, drones, and robots) to work in smarter ways. For example, the integration of FPGA, ASIC (TPU, NPU, VPU, etc.) circuit chips and AI software enables sensors to have sufficient computational resources and storage capacity to run ML algorithms, which makes them intelligent.</p>

LPWAN, typically NarrowBand IoT, LTE-M, etc., realizes high reliability, long-distance coverage (up to more than 50km) of wireless transmission with low power consumption, and has an excellent ability to penetrate obstacles, making it one of the most promising technologies for smart city and manufacturing.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of data heterogeneity has been a hot topic in FL for a long time, and unfortunately, in industrial manufacturing, heterogeneous data can be found everywhere. This problem arises from clients’ preferences for different objects, actions, and properties, its impact is reflected in skewed local data distributions and can impair the convergence of many common parallel algorithms, notably FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Conversely, some work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has shown that training clients sequentially is less affected by data heterogeneity, that is, clients train local models received from their predecessor clients and deliver the trained local models to their successor clients. In some cases, such as the local dataset is properly shuffled and traversed for only one epoch, this sequential training mode is theoretically equivalent to the centralized SGD algorithm, making it inherently robust to data heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Following this idea, Duan et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed an intuitive approach, in which they assign clients to multiple groups and force the overall data distributions between the groups to be homogeneous. Then, faced with clients that still have heterogeneous data in the group, they adopt the sequential training mode to jointly train a model. On the other hand, parallel algorithms (e.g., FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>) can be used between groups as their data becomes homogeneous. Their approach obtains noticeable gains in model performance on non-i.i.d. data. However, they only considered a static environment where local datasets do not change, making it unsuitable for highly dynamic industrial practices such as streaming data.</p>

the number of groups. Similarly, the clients within each group are trained in sequence, and the clients between groups are trained in parallel. As rounds progress, clients are split into more groups and each group contains fewer clients. This means that the FL process is gradually transforming from (fully) sequential to (fully) parallel training.</p>

Then, the selected groups perform the following operations in parallel: The first client of each group pulls the latest global model from the FL server and delivers it to the next client in order after local training, until the last client pushes the sequentially trained model to the FL server. When receiving model parameters from preorder clients, these clients traverse the batch of streaming data just captured for one epoch, and train the model using typical optimizers such as SGD and Adam. Finally, the models of all groups are aggregated at the FL server to update the global model.</p>

As a result, training samples should be discarded after being used once, and the ML model will gradually forget the information of historical samples, which is called learning forgetting (or catastrophic forgetting)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we propose a semantic-based compression and compensation approach, named SCC, to make long-term historical data recordable and calibrate classifier parameters to alleviate forgetting. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-D SCC: Semantic Compression &amp; Compensation ‣ III Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics ‣ HFedMS: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics in Industrial Metaverse" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, SCC stores the semantic features extracted by the feature representation layer and adaptively compensates for outdated semantics. The semantic features are low-dimensional feature embeddings of the raw input data (e.g., vectors of dimension 100), and their number of bytes stored is much less than the raw data (e.g., HD video streams), making the long-term data streams lightweight and recordable. Then these cached data semantics can be used to extend the current data semantics and calibrate the training of classifier parameters.</p>

These results demonstrate that <span id="S4.SS2.p2.3.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-S is strongly robust to data heterogeneity, and its advanced version <span id="S4.SS2.p2.3.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-D is also very suitable for processing dynamic streaming data.</p>

This proves that constructing groups with homogeneous data distribution can indeed resist the negative effects of data heterogeneity. But surprisingly, Benchmark and ICG show diametrically opposite performances on the loss metric, that is, overfitting, as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ IV-B Results and Discussion ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ HFedMS: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics in Industrial Metaverse" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7b</span></a>. This is reasonable because of the static nature of Benchmark (i.e., the number and members of groups are fixed), which makes it possible for the FL model to learn some interfering information, such as the order in which clients perform sequential training. Therefore, <span id="S4.SS2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-S was proposed to solve this problem, by introducing STP to make it dynamic. For example, regrouping clients, increasing the number of groups, and shuffling clients.

For a fair comparison, we use the total number of updated parameters as the x-axis to compare the convergence performance. From Figure <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ IV-B Results and Discussion ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ HFedMS: Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Memorable Data Semantics in Industrial Metaverse" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, we can see that <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-D converges much faster on streaming non-i.i.d. data. This is expected as <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-S is not optimized for the learning forgetting problem, which is also our motivation to introduce SCC and propose a more advanced <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-D.</p>

In general, <span id="S4.SS2.p13.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-D works much better than <span id="S4.SS2.p13.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>-S, with significantly faster convergence and higher accuracy.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning, as one of the enabling technologies laying the foundation for Metaverse, provides powerful collaborative data analysis tools with privacy protection guarantees. Facing severe constraints and key challenges of incorporating FL into Industrial Metaverse, that is, data heterogeneity, learning forgetting, and limited bandwidth, this paper proposed a high-performance and efficient FL system, named <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span>, to simultaneously address these three challenges. This system uses a new concept of STP training mode to achieve dynamic collaboration between devices, and a fast ICG algorithm to group devices and minimize heterogeneity. Then, SCC is proposed to address learning forgetting induced by streaming data, which compensates for the forgotten knowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates only classifier parameters. Finally, the system runs in LASP protocol to block the transmission of redundant parameters and reduce communication costs. Extensive experiments were conducted on the static and streamed non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset. Numerical results clearly show that <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to eight benchmarks in both settings, with significantly a higher accuracy, faster convergence, less runtime, and lower communication costs. These advantages demonstrate the advanced performance of our <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">HFedMS</span> system on streaming non-i.i.d. data.</p>
