<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">When implementing hierarchical federated learning over wireless networks, scalability assurance and the ability to handle both interference and device data heterogeneity are crucial. This work introduces a new two-level learning method designed to address these challenges, along with
a scalable over-the-air aggregation scheme for the uplink and a bandwidth-limited broadcast scheme for the downlink that efficiently use a single wireless resource. To provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient aggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of uplink and downlink interference is minimized through optimized receiver normalizing factors. We present a comprehensive mathematical approach to derive the convergence bound for the proposed algorithm, applicable to a multi-cluster wireless network encompassing any count of collaborating clusters, and provide special cases and design remarks. As a key step to enable a tractable analysis, we develop a spatial model for the setup
by modeling devices as a Poisson cluster process over the edge
servers and rigorously quantify
uplink and downlink error terms due to the interference. Finally,
we show that despite the interference and data heterogeneity, the proposed algorithm
not only achieves high learning accuracy for a variety of parameters but also significantly outperforms the conventional hierarchical learning algorithm.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the growing pervasiveness and computational power of wireless edge devices, i.e., phones, smart watches, sensors, and autonomous vehicles, there is an increasing demand for enabling machine learning to train a global model from the diverse distributed data over the edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, loading such enormous amounts of data from the devices to a central server is not often feasible due to strict constraints on latency, power, and bandwidth, or concerns on data privacy. A promising and practically feasible distributed approach is federated learning (FL), which is able to implement machine learning directly at the wireless edge while under no circumstances the data leaves the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In this approach, the model training is performed locally at each single device with the help of a parameter server, such that synchronous
model update at all devices and model aggregation at the server are repeated until convergence. Most studies on FL consider a single server. However, to support more devices that can collaborate and to speed up the learning process, recent studies have proposed hierarchical architectures for FL that incorporate a core server and multiple edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The hierarchical FL has two levels of aggregation of model parameters: the intra-cluster aggregation at the edge servers (edge aggregation) and then an inter-cluster aggregation at the core server (core aggregation). The goal of this paper is to propose a hierarchical learning scheme that is both resource efficient and resilient to data heterogeneity and wireless interference from parallel learning processes, and to provide a modeling methodology that allows to express and evaluate the interference and its effect.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The convergence properties of hierarchical FL, without considering the limitations of a wireless environment is evaluated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, proposing server selection, node scheduling and data compression solutions. The limited resources and wireless channel impairments under orthogonal transmissions and fixed network configurations are taken into account for example in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. It is recognized however that the orthogonal transmissions lead to performance bottlenecks when a high number of devices participate in the learning.
An effective and desirable approach for these scenarios is known as over-the-air FL, which utilizes the over-the-air computation scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This approach leverages interference caused by simultaneous multi-access transmissions from edge devices to perform aggregation. Through the integration of communication and computation, over-the-air FL can operate with significantly fewer resources and lower latencies in both communication and computation compared to FL using orthogonal transmissions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. An extensive survey of opportunities and challenges of FL in wireless networks is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The majority of research in the field of over-the-air FL focuses on single-cell learning scenarios, with an emphasis on the uplink transmissions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Recently, several works include specific aspects of uplink interference. Interferers distributed according to Poisson point processes (PPPs) are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
An abstract interference model with heavy tail is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and it is shown that while heavy tail slows down the learning process, it may improve the generalization capability. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, transmission power is controlled to escape from saddle points. Studies have been also conducted to examine bandwidth-limited downlink in both single-cell <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and multi-cell <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> settings.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical FL using over-the-air computation is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and that is the work most closely related to our paper. However, that study assumes the presence of multiple antennas at the edge servers, an ideal downlink transmission, and most importantly, does not account for inter-cell interference.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To understand the effect of interference in hierarchical FL and provide a comprehensive network analysis, we turn to stochastic geometry. Stochastic geometry has been developed as a tool to characterize interference in networks, taking the location of the nodes into account <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Within the field, there are two <em id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">canonical</em> approaches to characterize wireless networks. One of them is PPPs, which assumes uniform device and server placements, and has applications in cellular networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The other approach is based on Poisson cluster processes (PCPs), which takes into account non-uniformity and allows to model the correlation between the locations of the devices and servers within and among clusters. PCPs are justified by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and widely-adopted in deployments where devices are frequently grouped together,
meaning that they are commonly found in specific areas, known as “hotspots” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. The PCP fits to the application area of distributed learning on hierarchical networks, which are composed of explicitly defined clusters, such as transportation and other smart city sensing applications, environmental monitoring or industrial IoT. Moreover, it is designed to allow performance models where the effects of the network parameters are pronounced. Therefore, this is the approach we follow in this paper.</p>

The schemes are independent of the number of clusters and devices, and each iteration all over the network is performed only in one single resource block, for both the uplink and the downlink. We design uplink and downlink power control schemes, and propose receiver normalizing factors that minimize the distortion of the recovered gradients or model vectors, taking task diversity, data heterogeneity, wireless channel impairments and interference into account. While the proposed transmission scheme is general, we apply it for MultiAirFed, and express the intra- and inter-cluster aggregation errors caused by the uplink and downlink interference.</p>

Then, we characterize the learning convergence in terms of the optimality gap for the setup, as a function of the network parameters, and present design remarks and special cases. The optimiality gap is tractable and well structured, where it is easy to identify the effects of the learning parameters, the transmission scheme and the network topology.</p>

Increasing the number of devices in each cluster or the number of collaborating clusters increases the learning accuracy, however, the improvement is limited by increasing the interference. A higher density of cluster centers has also a degrading effect on the learning performance. Our numerical results show that MultiAirFed, based on the combination of gradient and model parameter aggregations, can provide significantly better learning accuracy compared to the other hierarchical FL algorithm in the proposed wireless setup.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">In wireless networks, clusters are mostly modeled as disk-shaped regions where nodes are distributed uniformly. When these clusters are employed in a PCP, the resulting point process is
referred to as Matérn cluster process (MCP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Research has demonstrated that MCP can be utilized to accurately simulate actual setups utilized by 3GPP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Also, since the edge servers are usually located
inside base station buildings or integrated with antenna towers,
there are protective zones over them where devices and other edge servers cannot
be located. These zones are additionally motivated to suppress interference by inhibiting nearby devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we

all channel gains are assumed invariant during one time slot required for
an uplink or downlink transmission, while they change independently from one time slot to another. The communication between the edge servers and the respective core server is performed over high-capacity backhaul links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

The MultiAirFed is a combination of intra-cluster gradient and inter-cluster
model parameter aggregation. Gradient aggregation has been shown to be robust to noise and interference in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and to non-i.i.d. data in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, and therefore is a good candidate for the intra-cluster learning process over the interfering wireless links.
The model-parameter aggregation at the core server at the same time allows multiple inter-cluster iterations.
The resulting hierarchical learning process is shown on Fig. 1 and Algorithm 1.

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to other hierarchical methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> which are based on model parameter transmissions, gradient transmission in MultiAirFed over wireless links is expected to be more robust to channel noise and interference. This is because for each device local update, a noisy model parameter aggregation leads to imperfections both on the initial model parameter vector update and the local gradient function evaluation in (<a href="#S3.E5" title="In III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). Moreover, the resulting errors propagate and reinforce through multiple local steps. As learning convergence demands high accuracy in the gradient direction, particularly in the vicinity of the optimal solution, noisy model parameter aggregation may hinder the model to converge. However, when gradients are transmitted, devices can download the aggregated gradient (<a href="#S3.E6" title="In III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) as a same gradient term for their update without the need for local computations, and the initial model parameter vector remains unaffected by any noise. This further guarantees that the local steps taken during an inter-cluster iteration will continuously approach convergence. Moreover, in general, gradient based aggregation is shown to be resilient against heterogeneity and non-i.i.d. data when compared to approaches that transmit model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. These will be further justified through experimental results in Section VI. Also, even though gradient transmission does not permit multiple local iterations at each intra-cluster iteration, the proposed final gradient descent (<a href="#S3.E8" title="In III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>)-(<a href="#S3.Ex1" title="III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) serve as a reinforcement for integrating local training into the learning process.</p>

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Before we conclude this discussion, please note that the proposed learning method is not limited to the choice of the spatial model in Subsection II.A and the sequel transmission scheme in Section IV. It can be easily applied to different scenarios of multi-server FL.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To implement MultiAirFed, we propose a scalable transmission scheme including two types of analog transmissions for uplink and downlink, where each is done simultaneously over the clusters in a single resource block, as shown on the message exchange diagram on Fig. 1. It is inspired from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> which shows that analog downlink approach significantly outperforms the digital one. Synchronization is required within a cluster, this is a common assumption in the literature, see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. It is also worth noting that the transmission scheme is not constrained to the spatial model choice presented in Subsection II.A, but the spatial model is needed to derive analytic expressions for the gradient and model aggregations. From here, we ignore the iteration indexes for simplicity of presentation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the uplink, we propose a clustered over-the-air aggregation scheme. The term "over-the-air" stems from the facts that devices transmit simultaneously and the objective is to construct the aggregation vectors (<a href="#S3.E6" title="In III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) and (<a href="#S3.E11" title="In III Proposed Learning Method ‣ Scalable Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>) at the edge servers based on the additive nature of wireless multiple-access channels. The term "clustered" comes from the fact that the power allocation in each cluster is distinct from other clusters.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on an intra- or inter-cluster iteration, the gradient parameters or model parameters at each
device are normalized before transmission to have zero mean and unit variance. There are two advantages to normalizing the parameters. First, when the parameters have zero-mean entries, the estimates obtained in the sequel are unbiased. Second, when the entries have unit variance, the interference and consequently the error terms depend only on the power control, and do not depend on the specific values of the model or gradient parameters.</p>

These are followed by the effects of the intra- and inter-cluster uplink and downlink errors. The scaling factors of the error terms depend on the learning parameters and on the device selection, while the error terms depend on the interference, determined by network topology, the wireless environment and the power control.

We consider the "over-the-air" transmission scheme proposed in Section IV both for MultiAirFed and for HierFed. Additionally, we implement all the methods with "orthogonal" transmissions in both uplink and downlink, which eliminates interference by assuming unlimited communication resources.
Fig. 10 considers non-i.i.d. data distribution.
The results indicate that MultiAirFed outperforms HierFed by a substantial margin, for both transmission schemes. This highlights the robustness of MultiAirFed against both data heterogeneity and interference.

While the accuracy is increased fast in the first iterations, the learning does not converge. This supports our reasoning in Section III, and motivates the use of MultiAirFed. On both Figs 10 and 11, the performance of FedSGD is weak even under orthogonal transmission, as this scheme does not take advantage of the hierarchical structure. Therefore, we do not evaluate the effect of interference.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a new two-level federated learning algorithm that leverages the hierarchical network architecture and intra- and inter-cluster collaborations for a higher communication efficiency and learning accuracy. To implement the proposed algorithm over wireless distributed systems independent of their scale and with minimum resource requirements, we presented an over-the-air aggregation scheme for the uplink and a bandwidth-limited broadcast scheme for the downlink, and determined how uplink and downlink interference impacts gradient and model aggregations in the algorithm. To minimize the interference-induced distortion on the estimations, we incorporated and optimized normalizing factors. We utilized PCP to characterize the spatial distribution of the devices and edge servers, derived a convergence bound of the learning process, and presented design remarks. Our results show that the PCP based modeling leads to useful insights on how the network parameters affect the interference and consequently the learning performance. The presented experimental results confirm the analytic findings and demonstrate that the proposed gradient based hierarchical FL outperforms existing solutions, and achieves high accuracy, despite interference and data heterogeneity.</p>
