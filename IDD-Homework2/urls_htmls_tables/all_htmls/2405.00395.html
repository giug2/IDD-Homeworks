<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Containerization technology plays a crucial role in Federated Learning (FL) setups, expanding the pool of potential clients and ensuring the availability of specific subsets for each learning iteration. However, doubts arise about the trustworthiness of devices deployed as clients in FL scenarios, especially when container deployment processes are involved. Addressing these challenges is important, particularly in managing potentially malicious clients capable of disrupting the learning process or compromising the entire model.
In our research, we are motivated to integrate a trust element into the client selection and model deployment processes within our system architecture. This is a feature lacking in the initial client selection and deployment mechanism of the On-Demand architecture. We introduce a trust mechanism, named "Trusted-On-Demand-FL", which establishes a relationship of trust between the server and the pool of eligible clients. Utilizing Docker in our deployment strategy enables us to monitor and validate participant actions effectively, ensuring strict adherence to agreed-upon protocols while strengthening defenses against unauthorized data access or tampering.
Our simulations rely on a continuous user behavior dataset, deploying an optimization model powered by a genetic algorithm to efficiently select clients for participation. By assigning trust values to individual clients and dynamically adjusting these values, combined with penalizing malicious clients through decreased trust scores, our proposed framework identifies and isolates harmful clients. This approach not only reduces disruptions to regular rounds but also minimizes instances of round dismissal, Consequently enhancing both system stability and security.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Businesses and software solutions are in a high state of evolution, continually harnessing technology to enhance user experiences. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central player in this progression, revolutionizing various domains. Notably, Federated Learning (FL) has garnered attention as a promising method for implementing AI. FL empowers Machine Learning (ML) models to undergo training on decentralized datasets, eliminating the need for centralizing data sources. This approach not only enhances efficiency but also prioritizes privacy, a critical concern in today’s data-driven landscape. The process begins by selecting a subset of available devices to participate in iterative learning stages, ensuring the model’s convergence. Subsequently, clients share their updated weights with a central server, which aggregates these weights to refine the model. The selection of clients for each round employs a random selection approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The act of sharing private data due to privacy concerns poses a significant challenge. However, FL offers a solution by enabling the utilization of newly generated data while preserving confidentiality. Expanding on this concept, recent studies, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sami and Mourad (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, have leveraged containerization technology to efficiently distribute services across nearly-deployed fog devices. Building upon this foundation, subsequent research presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chahoud et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023b</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chahoud et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023c</a>)</cite> extended the architecture to facilitate On-Demand client deployment, allowing for the utilization of private data in the learning process as needed. This On-Demand architecture relies on deploying Docker containers on volunteering devices, which serve as clients in FL rounds.
This approach has proven effective, particularly in dynamic environments or scenarios with limited available clients, as we now have a larger pool of clients to choose from and more data available for our learning process.
Docker, a leading containerization solution, simplifies application deployment across diverse environments by packaging applications and their dependencies into self-contained, lightweight executable units known as containers. Complementing Docker, Kubeadm offers a utility for swiftly constructing Kubernetes clusters, enabling the creation of clusters using any resource-constrained device and a master node. This flexibility makes Kubeadm a valuable tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deploying models encapsulated in our containers onto unknown devices to prepare them to serve as clients raises concerns about the trustworthiness of these devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chahoud et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023a</a>)</cite>. Within our FL architecture, this introduces a potential vulnerability in the form of malicious client activities, capable of disrupting the training process.
Leveraging Docker containers proves to be a valuable strategy in addressing trust-related challenges. By encapsulating the model and its dependencies within a Docker container, FL aaplications can ensure the reproducibility and verification of the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chahoud et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023d</a>)</cite>. Additionally, Docker’s isolation mechanisms enhance the security of the training environment, mitigating potential attacks or malicious behaviors from participants. However, caution must be exercised when deploying containers on devices involved in FL, considering the potential for malicious intent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wazzeh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
Henthfore, it is essential to introduce trust-oriented mechanisms into both the FL and containerization processes, an aspect often overlooked in prior research endeavors such as those outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Zhang et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2022</span></a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gu and Yang (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tahanian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which primarily focused on addressing issues related to model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The existing body of research offers several methodologies for identifying malicious clients, which tackle many of the challenges mentioned earlier. However, none of the previous studies have put forth the idea of including a trust metric when deploying models On-Demand via containerization technology. Within this paper, we illustrate how this trust factor undergoes continuous updates, drawing from the client’s successful deployment history. This update process involves a two-step verification mechanism designed to detect any label manipulation or unexpected updates, monitoring for substantial deviations from expected group behaviors in instances of random or consistent weight adjustments, and cross-referencing contextual information to identify any inconsistencies. Moreover, it captures the developing nature of trust connections and makes more accurate and informed decisions in the FL process by including dynamic trust calculations while assigning initial trust values using Bootstrapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wahab et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. For the purpose of deploying models and efficiently selecting clients, we establish a multi-objective formulation that encompasses various objectives and limitations to be taken into account during the deployment process. Solving this multi-objective problem of efficient deployment is achieved through the utilization of a genetic algorithm.
To demonstrate the value and benefits of our method, we employ the MDC dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Laurila et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> as an example of real-world simulation, while also utilizing ModularFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Arafeh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> to facilitate the application of FL models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, various scenarios were examined, including those involving FL setups with static, distant, and unavailable trusted clients. In this context, our dynamic deployment approach, while mindful of our objectives and constraints, empowers capable and dependable clients to actively participate in the learning environment.
Furthermore, several scenarios were conducted to detect the malicious clients and their effect on the model while using the proposed model compared to other solutions in the literature.
The experiments performed produced promising outcomes, showcasing a reduction in the number of rounds needed for convergence, maximizing accuracy, and the successful identification of malicious clients attempting to compromise the model when contrasted with the conventional random selection approach.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have conducted various innovative strategies to protect FL applications from malicious attacks. For instance, FLDetector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Zhang et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2022</span></a>)</cite> scrutinizes model updates to identify malevolent clients, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gu and Yang (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> employs a conditional variational autoencoder to detect suspicious updates. Extracting key features and analyzing their similarity using Hamming distance is explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Zhou et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2022</span></a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Xu et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2021</span></a>)</cite> evaluates received gradients for relevance and similarity data.
Addressing poisoning attacks, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tahanian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> introduces a resilient federated averaging method, employing a game-based approach where the server and clients participate to detect spurious updates. On the contrary, FedInv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Zhao et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2022</span></a>)</cite> tackles Byzantine attacks by reversing local updates, creating dummy datasets. Trust-driven client selection is emphasized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, focusing on IoT devices, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wahab et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> addresses the cold-start problem in FL by leveraging trust.
Further, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gâlvez et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposes a classification framework combining FL with secure semi-supervised ensemble learning to detect malicious applications while preserving user privacy. Decentralized FL methods, such as the one presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>)</cite>, operate without a central server, relying on online Push-Sum algorithms to establish trust among clients.
In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>)</cite> suggests a server-free decentralized FL method based on one-way trust relationships among clients, akin to a social network. Lastly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Muñoz-González et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> introduces the Adaptive Federated Averaging strategy, resilient to Byzantine attacks, utilizing Hidden Markov Models to detect and discard erroneous updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While previous research has made significant strides in fortifying FL against various malicious threats, a critical yet unexplored aspect is the integration of trust metrics into client selection and deployment within the On-demand FL architecture. This entails evaluating potential clients’ trustworthiness against predefined criteria prior to their selection in FL rounds, thus establishing a pool of newly trusted clients to enhance the overall security and reliability of the FL system. While prior studies predominantly focused on modified models and updates without explicitly addressing the challenge of distinguishing between malicious and benign participants, our approach tailors trust levels to each participant based on their individual characteristics and historical performance. Notably, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, the client selection method used incorporated a trust factor. However, such existing investigations have not sufficiently addressed the adaptability of FL models to accommodate newly deployed trusted devices, particularly in environments where such devices are limited, thereby influencing learning dynamics. Moreover, none of the prior works have provided a means to rapidly deploy clients in real-time while considering their behavioral patterns and trustworthiness.
By integrating trust values into the client selection and deployment mechanisms of our proposed On-Demand architecture, we not only mitigate the risks associated with malicious activities but also cultivate a culture of collaboration and cooperation among participants. This not only strengthens the resilience of FL systems against adversarial attacks but also creates opportunities to generate and deploy new trusted clients for the learning process, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness and adaptability of the FL framework.</p>

When an IoT device seeks to become part of a Kubeadm cluster, it might possess historical learning data, which the orchestrator can use to establish a trust rating.
If there is no existing data, the Initial Trust Generator component is used to guarantee fairness and allocate an initial trust score to the newly joined clients.
Each device that joins the kubeadm cluster will have a log table for each client (its ID, device type and number, movements, successful number of assigned jobs, and trust level). Since we are deploying models and services on these devices, a client that was expelled out is unable to re-enter using a different ID.
After that, clients are assigned a level of trust, and it changes in every participating round.
The orchestrator and clients jointly strive to maintain a high trust level, which relies on a two-step verification process, their environmental conduct, and their behavior. This two-step verification serves the purpose of revealing any occurrences where clients introduce random weights or manipulate their labels, as malicious actions could potentially skew the global model in favor of specific class labels, thereby compromising the model’s resilience and trustworthiness.
The actions of a client’s environment and behavior can be used to derive the following numerical values: (1) the number of successful model deployments; (2) behavioral tendance to change the nature group that each client belongs to; and (3) a check for discrepancies in the context sharing tables of devices that the orchestrator has received from.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The orchestrator will deploy containers on compatible client devices. To put it another way, the container needs sufficient resources to complete a task, and host devices cannot allocate fewer resources since the container manager would raise a flag and not run.
Any significant variation from that period can raise questions about the device’s willingness to share resources with the container. Additionally, given how dynamic and crowded today’s smart cities are, some devices may contain more data from earlier rounds, which will make the model take longer to complete on the end device.
Our approach accounts for this by analyzing the average movements of the device. High movements result in high data generation rates.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Normally, data generated within a container can only be accessed within that container and solely while it’s running. This data, including weights, is shielded from alterations. Host devices grant the container access to their data, and the container manages data division and preparation. Any host-level data changes can be identified during learning rounds but, once at the container level, data becomes inaccessible and unmodifiable by host devices.</p>

Bootstrapping is a method of recommendation employed across various sectors, such as cloud computing, to validate the reliability of recently deployed cloud services in cases where there exists no historical data regarding their past performances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wahab et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. In our method, we will use bootstrapping to assign an initial trust value to the new devices that wish to join the clusters. The suggested technique relies on the collaboration of many active orchestrators to assist in overcoming the challenges by establishing initial trust for incoming devices.
Every orchestrator maintains a collection of client device data from previous training iterations. This collection should encompass the attributes of each participating client device in the round (such as location, device category, and resource utilization), along with the level of trust earned by the device during the allocated round. When a new device enters the cluster with no prior trust, the server will anticipate the initial trust value by asking orchestrators to send over log datasets about their participating and reachable clients.
Using the gathered datasets, a decision tree regression model is trained to forecast the anticipated trust value. By utilizing Standard Deviation Reduction (SDR) in place of Information Gain, the ID3 method becomes suitable for constructing a regression decision tree <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Quinlan et al.

resource usage, priority, geographical location, availability, mobility, data characteristics, and trustworthiness. The task of selecting the optimal clients and effectively deploying them for learning is a challenging problem, known to be NP-hard. To simplify this problem, we model it as a knapsack problem and demonstrate its NP-hardness through proof.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By minimizing the number of active hosts, we can achieve energy and resource savings, resulting in reduced battery, CPU, and memory consumption across all available clients. Consequently, this enhances the accessibility of fog devices, enabling additional services or applications to make use of the extra hosts within a specific region. Moreover, in the context of FL, both server and client devices encounter difficulties related to the substantial exchange of parameters and weight updates. By considering this objective, we can alleviate network congestion. As discussed in a previous study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Xu and Wang</span> (<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2021</span></a>)</cite>, there is no need to select the maximum number of clients for each round. Opting for a smaller number of clients in the initial stages and gradually increasing the number in subsequent rounds can enhance the training loss and ultimately lead to higher accuracy especially when we have trust values taken into consideration.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Selecting clients with high levels of trust brings several advantages to the convergence of the model and contributes to a more efficient learning process. When clients with a proven track record of trustworthiness are chosen, the likelihood of encountering malicious attacks or unreliable behavior within their updates is significantly reduced. This is crucial because malicious updates can introduce noise or biased information that hinders the convergence of the model. The reduced presence of malicious or untrustworthy updates also safeguards the integrity and reliability of the overall learning process.

Data produced by such clients differ, particularly in terms of data nature.
Increased mobility generates a significant volume of data, enhancing the effectiveness of model training. The database of a user’s device expands as they engage in frequent movement and utilize their device more frequently. This expansion is attributed to the storage of location-based data and usage data within the device’s database, both of which gradually accumulate over time.
The presence of location-based data, such as GPS coordinates and timestamps, along with usage data, including app usage patterns and social media interactions, contributes to the growth of the device’s database. These types of data are typically stored within the device and increase as users engage in activities that involve location tracking, navigation, location-based services, and social media usage. Consequently, individuals who exhibit a higher degree of mobility are more likely to utilize their phones for such purposes, leading to an even greater accumulation of data. thus, a more heterogeneous and wider range of data the model now can learn from. Moreover, the model can ease the issues created by changes in distribution by combining data from many area locations. The model trained on a broad dataset is better suited to dealing with variations in data patterns, making it more flexible to shifting conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mishra et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Furthermore, it promotes transfer learning. The model may extract significant features and build transferable representations that generalize well across different locations by training on diverse datasets from different area locations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. This allows for efficient information transfer and lowers the need to retrain models from the ground up for each new area location.
A diversity in the output class in each round also helps the model to perform better on new testing data.

Organizations can assess the ability of the device to continuously execute deployed tasks without errors or disruptions by recording the number of tasks done successfully. This metric allows for the detection of probable anomalies or deviations from typical behavior, which may indicate potential security breaches or failures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Wei et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2021</span></a>)</cite>.

Due to the design of our architecture, we can deploy containers and volunteer devices that have expressed an interest in joining the cluster. However, some devices might not fully collaborate once containers have been deployed on such devices while taking into account the constraints and limitations. Certain devices may hide specific local log files when it comes to context sharing, while others may drop rounds not due to network issues or packet loss but as a subtle attempt to delay by consuming more shared resources with the containers, leading to their exclusion from the round. By factoring in these suspicious behaviors, we can develop a more comprehensive assessment of the trustworthiness of client <math id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i1.p2.1.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S4.I1.i2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this interactive process, both the orchestrator and individual clients participate in a game to collect information concerning their class labels and any potential label manipulations. Using their respective local test data and relaying local accuracy measurements to the orchestrator, the orchestrator initially focuses on clients with lower trust levels in the initial rounds. Rather than sending these clients the most recent global weights, the orchestrator transmits older global weights for comparison with their local accuracy. Suspicious clients frequently engage in label flipping and data label modifications to reduce the model’s reliability and introduce deception.
Issues concerning label manipulation by clients, Inconsistencies in local accuracies despite using identical prior global weights, and the transmission of incorrect local accuracy data to sabotage the global model may arise (Forman, 2016). These actions exemplify potential occurrences during learning, such as concealing or altering labels to mislead the model; clients engaged in such behavior should face repercussions through a reduction in their Trust score.</p>

<div id="S4.I1.i2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.I1.i2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In our dynamic environment, it’s possible for clients to have varying amounts of testing data from one round to another. Given that prior weights were computed from a limited number of recent rounds, minor fluctuations in local accuracy are tolerable, considering the fluctuating data volume. To detect unusual behavior in terms of local accuracies among IoT devices, the model employs a modified Z-score statistical technique, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Unlike the regular Z-score, the modified version uses the median instead of the mean, rendering it less sensitive to outliers. This method calculates the score by measuring the difference between local accuracies in a single round and the median accuracy from previous rounds and then dividing it by the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the metric, denoted as z. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Iglewicz and Hoaglin (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>, values with modified z-scores greater than 3.5 or less than -3.5 are considered potential outliers. However, the server has the flexibility to adjust this parameter based on its historical experience in specific areas.</p>

Our architecture determines whether the selected client has sufficient resources before deploying the model to a device. The training data and data volume of each device are not available to us. Environmental activities, though, can provide us with a clue. Environments with highly dynamic devices and a high level of movement can produce a lot of data. When compared to clients from other places, clients from this area typically take longer to complete their jobs. To do this, we group participating clients into clusters according to their Type, Average Movements, Average Round Finish Time, and CPU and RAM Capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Yousefi et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2020</span></a>)</cite>. By clustering clients according to similar data volumes generated from their motions and average task completion times while taking into account their resource capacities, we can efficiently group these devices. If a client is performing its tasks as usual while learning, it will most likely remain in the same cluster of the few previous rounds. However, if the orchestrator observes a client <math id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.I1.i3.p1.1.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math> frequently changing its group, this raises questions about its dependability of completing before or after the anticipated time to finish while it is grouped based on its data volume (movement), its resource capabilities, and its past completion times especially while having containers deployed on these clients. Clients who change clusters frequently or display unusual behavior may raise suspicions and necessitate further investigation to protect the integrity of the FL process.</p>

<p id="S4.I1.i3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The algorithm consists of clustering the clients based on the above-mentioned criteria using agglomerative clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tokuda et al.

By iteratively merging clients based on similarity measurements, it promotes the creation of clusters that enclose similar patterns inside themselves. By using an incremental technique, agglomerative clustering may handle large-scale FL scenarios. Instead of processing the full client population at once, it can gradually combine clients, making it suited for resource-constrained environments and tolerating constantly changing client populations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Taïk et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. The large deviation is then estimated by comparing the number of common neighbors in this round to the previous round. This will give an idea of whether or not the client is sticking with the same group of clients who have similar resource capabilities, mobility (volume of data), and average finishing time.</p>

In our architecture, the deployed clients have the security responsibility of surveying and reporting. Each client will be gathering shared data from its local neighbors. Deployed clients will submit their local log file and the most recent weights for each round. Any discrepancy between the data the orchestrator receives from clients will be checked for by the orchestrator. A client’s data with a high number of contradictions will raise greater questions about its reliability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ma et al.

The hosting capacity of the client is determined by factors such as CPU, memory, disk space, and battery level. Additionally, the learning utilization, which includes CPU, memory, disk space, and battery consumption, is taken into account.
This constraint ensures that clients are selected based on their remaining capacity to accommodate the learning workload. By considering both the resource capabilities and utilization, the system can optimize the allocation of clients, maximizing the utilization of available resources while preventing the overloading of individual clients.</p>

However, newly added clients will tend to have lower trust levels than experienced clients. For that, applying a balance in the way of deploying the clients by taking into consideration choosing some clients with low initial levels of trust. Without these constraints, the multi-objective optimization problem will always choose clients with the highest trust level neglecting the newly joined ones.
Therefore, in order to prevent redundancy during deployment, the server establishes a threshold to specify the proportion of clients with substantial trust.

<p id="S5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In our GA algorithm, binary tournament selection is used to choose individuals from the populations. One-point crossover is employed as the crossover method, with crossover applied to each parent based on a hyper-parameter-defined probability. For the mutation step, the bit string mutation technique is adopted, assigning each gene a mutation probability of 1/L, where L denotes the number of deployable clients. By integrating this mutation strategy, the algorithm avoids local optima traps, enhances diversity, and ensures fair opportunities for clients with lower mutation probabilities to undergo mutation.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our training, the "MOBILE DATA CHALLENGE (MDC)" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Laurila et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> dataset is utilized. Given that we are dealing with datasets from the actual world.
The MDC dataset comprises a significant volume of continuous mobile phone data employed for modeling individual behavior and social network dynamics.
We employed Python to execute the data preprocessing phase, which involved handling a dataset comprising continuous device movement records. By consolidating GPS coordinates, we grouped them into twenty distinct locations and six broader areas. The "area" feature represents a cluster of multiple specific places. Furthermore, we extracted and incorporated features such as date, day of the week, visit duration, and visit frequency for utilization in our model. The dataset for our 50 clients contains varying numbers of records, ranging from 200 to 1,500 entries. This data partitioning follows a non-identically distributed (non-IId) data distribution pattern, meaning that each client’s data segments and class labels differ. We determine the allocation of user data to a specific client device based on the device’s location. The simulations were conducted using the ModularFed framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Arafeh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the base model, a 128-by-256 deep neural network with three hidden layers and the "ReLU" activation function is employed. The centralized base model attains a 60% accuracy rate on the dataset, whereas our proposed FL model achieves 50% accuracy. This performance disparity between the base model and the FL model is expected when working with real-world datasets and maintaining data privacy.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We examine situations where numerous volunteer devices are present in specific locations, necessitating the dynamic deployment of trusted clients in these areas. In scenarios where data and trusted clients are scarce, our architecture plays a pivotal role in facilitating the deployment and maintenance of a substantial number of trusted clients during the learning phase. We compare these simulations with the default random selection method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, the centralized model and the trust establishment approach described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al.

As pioneers in introducing a trust mechanism for the On-Demand architecture, our comparison extends beyond the conventional FL malicious client detection methods. Unlike previous works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al.

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">1) Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5 GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR TRUSTED CLIENT DEPLOYMENT ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> presents a compelling comparison between the quantity of accessible trusted clients and the reliance on static, trustworthy clients typical in traditional learning frameworks. The expanded pool of trustworthy clients in various locations presents a distinct advantage, as it amplifies the availability of reliable data sources. Conversely, environments dependent on static clients encounter challenges such as prolonged round-trip times due to distant clients and scarcity of trustworthy options, leading to frequent discards during the learning process.
Our innovative architecture effectively addresses these challenges by facilitating the deployment of trustworthy clients precisely where they’re needed, even in remote or inaccessible areas. In the depicted scenario, the increased availability of trusted devices stands ready to contribute as FL clients, exemplifying the adaptability and scalability of our approach.
Moreover, Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5 GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR TRUSTED CLIENT DEPLOYMENT ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> showcases the continual growth of data volume available for learning, paralleled by the strategic deployment of volunteer clients. As the data reservoir expands, the role of orchestrators becomes increasingly pivotal.

In each round, a fraction of clients is deployed and their trust levels are continuously monitored, resulting in a notable improvement in accuracy from zero learning to a substantial level with each passing round. This On-Demand container deployment approach, coupled with trust monitoring, underscores the significance of our proposed method.
Furthermore, when employing the conventional random selection method without considering trust and the above-mentioned objective functions, a significant number of rounds are discarded, causing delays and hindering the global model’s quest for the desired accuracy, especially when dealing with untrusted actions from malicious clients. Conversely, by recording and leveraging the trust levels of each client and selecting those with higher trust, we achieve the desired accuracy with fewer discarded rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p7.1" class="ltx_p">3) The implementation of a trust bootstrapping mechanism is critical in the FL process. Several advantages are gained by continuously updating the trust factor and deploying devices based on the established objective functions.
Figure <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 6 Results and analysis ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows a comparison of the accuracy levels obtained when using random trust initialization against the bootstrapping method. The graph clearly shows the significant gap between convergence time and trust value evolution. When the random assignment is used, the model has a long convergence phase, requiring numerous rounds of clients to progressively increase their trust levels. The bootstrapping technique, on the other hand, allows for the assignment of fair and appropriate beginning trust values. This increases the model’s trustworthiness by allowing it to quickly access a larger pool of highly trusted clients. As a result, the model reaches convergence by round 20, whereas random assignment delays the process due to the initially low trust values assigned.
The trust bootstrapping technique is significant because of its capacity to accelerate the integration of trustworthy devices into the FL process. By starting with greater trust values, the model may better use the knowledge and contributions of trustworthy clients, resulting in increased performance and faster convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p8.1" class="ltx_p">4) Furthermore, throughout the execution of our FL application, we encountered instances where certain clients exhibited malicious behavior. Figure <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6 Results and analysis ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> illustrates a comparison between our solution with no malicious clients and our solution with added malicious clients. During the learning process, we intentionally introduced clients engaging in malicious activities, such as concealing their data from containers post-deployment and altering their behavior, specifically targeting the criteria outlined in Algorithm 3, which focuses on detecting large deviations from expected group behavior.
These malicious clients, exhibiting frequent cluster changes or unusual behavior, raise suspicions. Such anomalies occur when clients complete tasks before their expected time, based on their historical data volumes, resources, capabilities, and typical completion times. Any deviation from these patterns can indicate suspicious behavior.
In the left portion of Figure <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6 Results and analysis ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we observe three devices highlighted in red consistently changing clusters across multiple rounds. These devices either fail to process all available data, finish well before or after expected, or exhibit inconsistent behavior. Consequently, these devices receive lower trust scores. However, despite the presence of malicious clients, our solution demonstrates resilience by continuing to deploy and select high-quality clients, maintaining a high level of trust, learning accuracy, and performance compared to scenarios without malicious clients.</p>

<p id="S6.p9.1" class="ltx_p">5) Figure <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 6 Results and analysis ‣ Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> illustrates the performance of DDQN-Trust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> in comparison to our approach, both with and without malicious acts. While we do not directly compare their use of Deep Reinforcement Learning for client selection, our focus lies in comparing their method of calculating Trust values, which inform their selection algorithm in each round. Since relying solely on objective functions for client selection is insufficient in deployment scenarios, we utilize their Trust mechanism for comparison.
Our architecture demonstrates the ability to detect malicious clients and assign fair Trust values to penalize their actions. The graph showcases the impact of identifying instances where clients attempt to manipulate their training data labels, intentionally undermining the model’s performance. Our Trust factor addresses this issue by evaluating testing accuracies based on previously calculated weights. As depicted, our approach consistently maintains a highly trusted environment with high accuracy. In contrast, DDQN-Trust struggles to achieve satisfactory performance, especially in scenarios where clients constantly change and flip labels, reaching a maximum of 30% accuracy. If we solely rely on monitoring resource utilization to detect suspicious behavior, these clients will persist in manipulating labels while consuming resources at normal levels, hindering model progression and convergence.
Furthermore, our objective functions play a pivotal role in early accuracy enhancement by selecting clients from diverse geographical locations and different clusters. This strategy ensures greater data heterogeneity, enriching the model’s learning experience. By combining these approaches, we evaluate client behavior within the FL system and assign unique trust ratings accordingly. This evaluation extends beyond mere resource monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rjoub et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> to encompass container-level considerations, where devices may utilize resources for other applications. This approach enables us to prioritize resources for the most reliable clients while mitigating the influence of malicious entities through appropriate penalization.</p>

The above graphs serve as clear evidence of how our approach accounts for attempts to undermine the model’s integrity by considering label flipping. Through these mechanisms, our architecture ensures a robust trust evaluation process, leading to improved model performance and reliability. This approach promotes enhanced diversity in the data utilized for training the model. The inclusion of diverse data sources contributes to a more comprehensive and representative learning experience.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The suggested architecture investigates FL client availability, reliability, and dependability.
Moreover, it facilitates the deployment of clients while simultaneously evaluating their reliability through the calculation of a trust score for each. The trust score undergoes continuous evaluation and modification, taking into account factors such as the two-step verification process, the number of successfully completed deployment tasks by each client, significant deviations from expected behaviors, and discrepancies in the log files. Leveraging Kubeadm and containerization advancements, we efficiently manage dynamic deployment, ensuring that clients are accessible on resource-constrained devices at any time and location. By leveraging a GA, we introduce a multi-objective optimization approach to resolve the deployment of both models and clients. The experimental results show that the suggested approach’s efficiency and upgrades are effective since fewer rounds are required to achieve the required accuracy by eliminating untrustworthy and unreliable clients. Furthermore, more dependable and trustworthy clients are available and assessed for learning in a variety of areas. In the future, we intend to develop a deep reinforcement solution for the deployment process, as well as other prediction approaches for Trust factors, area placements, and deployment.</p>
