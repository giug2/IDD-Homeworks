<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge-based visual question answering requires external knowledge beyond visible content to answer the question correctly. One limitation of existing methods is that they focus more on modeling the inter-modal and intra-modal correlations, which entangles complex multimodal clues by implicit embeddings and lacks interpretability and generalization ability. The key challenge to solve the above problem is to separate the information and process it separately at the functional level. By reusing each processing unit, the generalization ability of the model to deal with different data can be increased. In this paper, we propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>ndependent <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>nference <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>nits (<span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">IIU</span>) for fine-grained multi-modal reasoning to decompose intra-modal information by the functionally independent units. Specifically, IIU processes each semantic-specific intra-modal clue by an independent inference unit, which also collects complementary information by communication from different units. To further reduce the impact of redundant information, we propose a memory update module to maintain semantic-relevant memory along with the reasoning process gradually. In comparison with existing non-pretrained multi-modal reasoning models on standard datasets, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art, enhancing performance by 3%, and surpassing basic pretrained multi-modal models. The experimental results show that our IIU model is effective in disentangling intra-modal clues as well as reasoning units to provide explainable reasoning evidence. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lilidamowang/IIU.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The knowledge-based visual question answering task requires agent to answer questions according to visual content and external knowledge. Compared to AI agent, human can easily combine visual observation with external knowledge to answer questions. Recent development on multi-modal inference mainly focuses on incorporating multimodal information in the reasoning process. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> uses GCN to reason on fact graphs with image-question-entity embeddings. Mucko <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> utilizes a heterogeneous graph depicting images with layers of visual, semantic, and knowledge-based information. Following heterogeneous graphs reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduces a parallel reasoning model for separate modal processing, enhancing generalization and extendibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods generally process the question-relevant information through a single reasoning module or gather question-relevant information from different modalities independently. A more fine-grained approach, processing only the relevant parts of information differently, can simplify training and boost the model’s generalization capability across diverse datasets. As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, for two different questions and images, they have different reasoning processes. For example, for the question on the left, the model needs to first identify the located fruit as a strawberry, and then based on relevant knowledge about strawberries, provide the name of the country with the highest production as the answer. In contrast, for the question on the right, the model needs to locate and identify the surfboard in the man’s hand, and then answer the question based on relevant knowledge. Although the two questions have different processing objects, the required reasoning abilities for an AI agent are similar between the two questions, including relation recognition, object identification, and external knowledge reasoning. By combining and reusing different abilities, reasoning for more questions can be achieved, improving the model’s accuracy and generalization.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>ndependent <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>nference <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">U</span>nits (IIU) for fine-grained multi-modal reasoning to decompose intra-modal information by the functionally independent units. Specifically, we utilize the multi-modal heterogeneous graph to extract question-relevant information as memory for reasoning from the original information. Then, we define the function of each reasoning unite by an independent GRU module, and each reasoning step activates a specific number of units through the attention mechanism. The information is decomposed through independent units at the functional level. Besides, to model the reasoning chains between independent inference units, we utilize units communication to organize the question-relevant inference units and pass internal reasoning results according to the reasoning sequence. To ensure that the semantic information is not distorted in the reasoning process and further reduce the impact of redundant information, we propose a memory reduction module to maintain semantic information in the process of reasoning.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We decompose multi-modal information functionally for modular reasoning, enhancing the model’s generalization ability by independent inference units with specific reasoning abilities. (2) By separating information at the functional level, we effectively process redundant information, thus bolstering model stability. (3) We visualize the units activated when processing different information of different modalities, and demonstrate good interpretability of our approach.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Visual Question Answering.</span> Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires agent to answer questions according to visual content, which needs the ability to understand and process multi-modal information.
In order to reduce the impact of redundant information, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> apply the attention mechanism to VQA tasks from different perspectives.
A trend to solve VQA task is to represent information through graph structure and complete reasoning on the graph. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> describe the objects and relationships in the image by constructing a scene graph.
This method is also effective for other visual tasks.
In knowledge-based visual question answering tasks, instead of building a scene graph, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> build a fact graph and each node is represented by the fixed form of image-question-entity embedding. However, the visual information is wholly provided which may introduce redundant information for prediction. To reduce noise and combine information from different modalities, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> depict an image by multi-layer graphs and perform cross-modal heterogeneous graph reasoning on them to capture complementary evidence from different layers that are most relevant to the question. However, reasoning on graph still focuses on modeling the inter-modal and intra-modal relationships in the Visual Question Answering task. Lack of more fine-grained reasoning methods to extract complex clues within the modal and increase the interpretability.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Separate Recurrent Models.</span>
In multi-step reasoning for VQA tasks, recurrent models like GRU are commonly used. However, our objective is to implement an independent reasoning mechanism. IndRNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a distinct separate recurrent model where each unit operates independently, lays the foundation for this approach. Building on this, RIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> introduces sparse inter-unit communication via an attention mechanism. Drawing inspiration from RIM, our model’s inference units not only reason independently but also gather complementary information.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task aims to predict an answer while reasoning uses external knowledge to construct memory graphs. The structure of our model is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We depict an image by three layers of graphs, including visual graph, semantic graph, and fact graph respectively, imitating the understanding of various properties of an object and relationships. Then we perform independent reasoning based on memory graph by
Independent Inference Module which consists of two parts. By stacking the two processes multiple times, our model realizes the reasoning of disentangling information from the functional level and reduces the influence of redundant information.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our IIU model is mainly composed of two parts in Independent Inference Module, Question Guide Memory Update, and Independent Units Inference. The reasoning information is decomposed through the functionally independent units. The processing of redundant information requires the cooperation of two modules. In Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we first study the influence of each module on the optimal accuracy without limiting the reasoning steps. In Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> model ‘2’, we turn Independent Units to one single GRU which removes the information disentangling, and the performance is 11% lower than the full model. We can also see in model ‘3’ that it is necessary to obtain complementary information from other units. Once we cut off the communication between the independent units, the results of the model dropped slightly by about 3%.
We can see from model ‘1’ that the Memory Update module will not have a great impact on the optimal accuracy, but still 2% lower than the full model. Because this module can help the model maintain memory information, on one hand, it removes used or redundant memories, and on the other hand, it helps the model update memory representations based on the state of inference. Besides the structure of our model, we also study the influence of modal information in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> model ‘5’, ‘6’ and ‘7’.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we will show how units decompose information and focus on a specific functional level. We set up 8 units, and the inference step is 20. In Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Interpretability and Visualization ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we show the average units activated by three different modalities information in each inference step. The information of these three modalities comes from Visual Graph, Semantic Graph, and Fact Graph respectively. We can see that the information of different modalities has different activation distributions of units. In modal of Visual Graph, the units of numbers 2, 6, and 7 are activated. Units No.1, 2 and 7 are activated in modal of Fact Graph, and 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7 are activated in modal of Semantic Graph. The activated units in the Semantic Graph modal contain other two modalities. The reason for this result is that Semantic Graph is a high-level representation of the image. So the reasoning process will overlap at the functional level with the modal of Visual Graph and activate the same units. Besides, the concepts in the Fact Graph are included in the Visual modal and the Semantic modal, accordingly the units for Fact modal reasoning may helpful to other modalities. At last, this experiment shows that IIU can decompose the input information and deal with each kind of information differently.</p>

We select the reasoning step as 30 and add redundant information in the last 10 reasoning. As shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Model Stability ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ IIU: Independent Inference Units for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the units group activated when processing key information is 0, 1, 4, 5.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Independent Inference Units (IIU) for visual question answering requiring external knowledge. IIU obtains clues hidden in complex multi-modal information by disentangling reasoning information from the functional level to improve the model’s performance. In addition, we also propose a Memory Update module to maintain semantic information and help the model resist the influence of noise. IIU as a flexible model achieved a new state-of-the-art result, and surpassing basic pretrained multi-modal models. In the future, we would like to explore whether the dynamic selection of reasoning steps can be realized.</p>
