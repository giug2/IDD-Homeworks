<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To comply with new legal requirements and policies committed to privacy protection, more and more companies start to deploy cross-silo Federated Learning at global scale, where several clients/silos collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server. Instead of data sharing and transmission, clients train models using their private local data and exchange model updates. However, there is little understanding of the carbon emission impact of cross silo Federated Learning due to the lack of related works. In this study, we first analyze the sustainability aspect of cross-silo Federated Learning, across the AI product life cycle instead of focusing only on the model training, with the comparison to the centralized method. A more holistic quantitative cost and CO2 emission estimation method for real world cross-silo Federated Learning setting is proposed. Secondly, we propose a novel data and application management system using cross silo Federated Learning and analytics to make IT companies more sustainable and cost effective.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has seen massive and accelerating growth in the last decades, and it is now responsible for a significant portion of the global CO2 emissions as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Towards more sustainable enterprise data and application management with cross silo Federated Learning and Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. According to recent studies, the ICT sector’s carbon footprint has grown quickly from around 1.5% to around 3.5% of total CO2 emissions. This growth is expected to be even faster in the future as more and more people rely on technology and Artifical Intenlligence (AI) solutions for their daily lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Hence, there is an increasing need to have solutions in making ICT sector more sustainable.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, compute, data storage and network are three main compositions of ICT companies’ CO2 emission and cost. It’s been discovered by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> that over half of the information stored by businesses has no value to daily operations. Additionally, over a third of data is obsolete or redundant, and therefore is known to be completely unusable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. With the surging popularity of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, more and more people are becoming aware of AI, and many companies are investing more in AI research and development. However, in the race to develop AI products, a lot of companies are ignoring the sustainability aspect. Training GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters consumed 1287 MWh of electricity, and resulted in carbon emissions of around 500 metric tons of CO2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, data and model training are just two example parts of the AI product life cycle, there are also a lot of CO2 emitted by data management, model inference, model management, etc.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a distributed learning framework known for its privacy-preserving ability, where several clients collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server. Instead of data transmission, clients train models using their private local data and upload model updates. When participated clients are small, distributed entities with relatively small amount of local data, it is called cross-device Federated Learning. In cross-silo Federated Learning, the clients are companies or organizations: small number of participants each with large amount of local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In the state-of-the-art studies, most of them focus on Federated Learning combating Non-IID data and trustworthy Federated Learning. A few existing solutions studied the energy efficient training strategies for Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, they mainly focus on reducing the energy cost of model training only for cross-device Federated Learning and lack of sustainability comparison with the centralized solution.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-silo Federated Learning is now starting to be deployed at a global scale by more companies as businesses need to comply with new legal requirements and policies committed to privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, the worrying situation is that we currently have little to no understanding of its impact on carbon emissions. In this work, we focus on how companies can reduce their carbon footprint by leveraging cross-silo Federated Learning, where few existing solution is found in the literature.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite fast development and impressive results of deep learning methods, the privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training and inference of deep learning models have also been raised in recent years. In response, alternatives to Centralized Learning such as Federated Learning and Federated Analytics have emerged. Federated Learning enables collaborative learning in a distributed way under the coordination of a central server. The term federated analytics was first coined by Google in 2020 to represent “collaborative data science without data collection,  re-using the Federated Learning infrastructure but without the learning part” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Both Federated Learning and Federated Analytics enhance the data privacy by avoiding data collection (putting datasets together) for learning/analysis. While most studies focus on the privacy perspective, Federated Learning and Federated Analytics are also potentially more sustainable than Centralized Learning by avoiding data transfer in the big data era as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ Towards more sustainable enterprise data and application management with cross silo Federated Learning and Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Few state of the art work put the focus on the sustainability perspective of Federated Learning. Recently, Savazzi et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> initialized an energy and carbon footprint analysis of distributed and Federated Learning. They quantify both the energy footprints and the carbon equivalent emissions for vanilla FL methods and consensus-based fully decentralized approaches. Similarly in the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors offered the first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of Federated Learning with a rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, facilitating the investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions.

The Microsoft team has released and improved the usage of the Federated Learning Cloud setting with multiple scenarios (the code can be found here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ml-federated-learning).

The role of the Orchestrator (the central server) is to aggregate the weights of local models and update the global model following a strategy such as FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. There is one data storage which is shared by the Orchestrator and local computes to exchange the model weights, where each local compute save the weights to this data storage after local training and the Orchestrator aggregate the local models’ weights and save the global model weights also to this storage.</p>

In Centralized Learning setting, the following step is to request access to the datasets and transfer them to the team’s own storage account, while there is no extra data copy, transfer and storage in the Federated Learning setting. The second step is data processing, model training and testing where the main CO2 emission comes from the compute instances or clusters. In this step, cross-silo Federated Learning as distributed computing method usually has more compute instances/clusters than Centralized Learning.

In this benchmark, they studied the training overhead, model performance and training scalability of the real world cross silo Federated Learning setting on Azure Cloud. Their key findings of the benchmark indicate that model performance is boosted with cross silo Federated Learning comparing to a single model with partial data. They also show that the model performance with cross silo Federated Learning is comparable to Centralized Learning (a single model trained on all data). In this work, we reuse their data, model and experimental protocol, with the focus on comparing the CO2 emission and cost between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Microsoft benchmark showed that the model performance with cross silo Federated Learning is comparable to Centralized Learning (a single model trained on all data). In this work, we put focus on comparing the CO2 emission and cost between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning reusing their data and experimental protocol.
To test the scalability of our implementation, we artificially replicated the datasets the same way as in the Microsoft benchmark. We compare cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning using 3 scales of datasets: small size dataset with around 1.2 GB data; medium size dataset with around 12 GB data; large size dataset with around 120 GB data. These dataset sizes should cover most classic Machine Learning use cases in companies.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the comparison between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning in terms of model training including the CPU/GPU usage, memory usage, disk usage and extra communication (for Federated Learning only) is studied. From the results in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Experimental results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Towards more sustainable enterprise data and application management with cross silo Federated Learning and Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, it can be seen that cross silo Federated Learning experiments have much less wall clock time across all dataset sizes due to the distributed training.
For both small and medium sized datasets, cross silo Federated Learning has slightly more CO2 emission and cost than Centralized Learning because it has extra communication rounds. However, for large datasize, Centralized Learning has much more CO2 emission and cost than cross silo Federated Learning because of larger compute clusters allocated (due to too large training datasize) <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span> To be noted that simple compute cluster selection method is used based on the datasize, which can be further improved</span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, the comparison between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning in terms of model training, data storage (extra cost of Centralized Learning) and data transfer (extra cost of Centralized Learning) altogether is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Experimental results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Towards more sustainable enterprise data and application management with cross silo Federated Learning and Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The blue color represents the CO2/cost of model training while the orange color represents the CO2/cost of data storage and transfer. It can be told that the results are different from the ones using model training only (which is the case on the literature of cross device Federated Learning). When combing model training with data transfer and storage, Centralized Learning has more CO2 emission and much more cost than cross silo Federated Learning across all training dataset sizes.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the model training energy and cost between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning is similar.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work develops a novel framework for the analysis of energy and carbon footprints in cross silo Federated Learning across the AI product life cycle instead of focusing only on the model training in the literature. This is the first study from Company data and product management perspective, with the comparison to the centralized method, with experiments on real Federated Learning setting on Azure Cloud, with the objective to help companies to be more cost effective and more environmentally friendly.
The main conclusions from the experiments are: the model training energy and cost between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning is similar. But the extra data transfer and data storage caused by Centralized Learning can lead to a lot of unnecessary CO2 emissions, which is often ignored in the state-of-the-art analysis.
Based on the experimental analysis, we also propose a cross-silo Federated Learning/Analytics based framework for companies to reduce data redundancy, model redundancy, and application redundancy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are several limitations of this study. Firstly, the performance comparison between cross silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning is not holistic. In the Microsoft benchmark, datasets used are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), which are not naturally cross silo datasets. Some real world cross silo datasets may be non-IID, which can make the Federated Learning training longer with worse performance. There is few state of the art solutions trying to deal with non-IID silos efficiently. Secondly, this work focuses on horizontal Federated Learning instead of vertical Federated Learning. However, the experimental results of vertical Federated Learning should be similar while some studies showing that vertical Federated Learning can perform better than Centralized Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Apart from Federated Learning, there are also other ways to learn a model collaboratively without data sharing which can perform better than Centralized Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Thirdly, the real world experiments do not include Federated Analytics (collaborative data science without model learning) use cases, which should be included in future works.</p>
