<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Automatically classifying cough sounds is one of the most critical tasks for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. However, collecting a huge amount of labeled cough dataset is challenging mainly due to high laborious expenses, data scarcity, and privacy concerns. In this work, our aim is to develop a framework that can effectively perform cough classification even in situations when enormous cough data is not available, while also addressing privacy concerns. Specifically, we formulate a new problem to tackle these challenges and adopt few-shot learning and federated learning to design a novel framework, termed F2LCough, for solving the newly formulated problem. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared with other approaches on COVID-19 Thermal Face &amp; Cough dataset, in which F2LCough achieves an average F1-Score of 86%. Our results show the feasibility of few-shot learning combined with federated learning to build a classification model of cough sounds. This new methodology is able to classify cough sounds in data-scarce situations and maintain privacy properties. The outcomes of this work can be a fundamental framework for building support systems for the detection and diagnosis of cough-related diseases.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Respiratory illnesses are highly prevalent, wherein cough serves as a typical and initial manifestation of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">corrao1979chronic </a></cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">smith2006cough </a></cite>. Recently, the world has revealed the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which is announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Source: https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1, accessed: April 29, 2022.</span></span></span> Covid-19 has lead to 509,531,232 confirmed cases and 6,230,357 deaths.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Source: https://covid19.who.int/, accessed: April 29, 2022.</span></span></span> A persistent cough is a common symptom among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as those with respiratory illnesses. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases through coughing symptoms is critical for healthcare professionals in providing appropriate treatment to patients. Consequently, there has been a significant increase in research aimed at utilizing cough sounds to diagnose respiratory diseases, including cough counting, sound classification, and detection. The current study delves into the challenge of classifying cough sounds in the presence of limited labeled cough data, while ensuring the protection of patients’ confidential information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent decades, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated their efficacy in supporting healthcare systems as evidenced by various studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">liao2021recognizing </a></cite>. There has been a proliferation of research that leverages machine learning models for the detection of coughs, with many studies focusing on analyzing cough sounds to develop cough recognition and classification systems. With the advancements in deep learning, methods based on deep neural networks for the detection and diagnosis of respiratory diseases from lung and cough sounds have been proposed and have shown promising results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">lella2022automatic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">pham2021cnn </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, deep learning models require a significant amount of labeled data for training. This presents a challenge in the case of cough classification, as the collection of labeled cough data is both expensive and risks the disclosure of sensitive information. The former challenge is due to the fact that deep learning algorithms typically require a large amount of data to perform optimally, while the latter challenge arises from the scarcity of correctly labeled cough data. Pathological cough data is only available from patients with the disease and requires expert labeling, making the collection of such data a major challenge in the healthcare field. This is attributed to the need for assistance from trained medical professionals, the protection of privacy, and obtaining consent from patients suffering from diseases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">ijaz2022towards </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the collection of medical data presents two practical challenges. The first challenge is the scarcity of data available in the early stages of novel diseases, as evidenced by the lack of medical data on COVID-19 prior to its outbreak. The second challenge pertains to the importance of security and privacy in the collection of medical data. Data protection laws are implemented to prevent the unauthorized collection of private information, and the use of public devices to record cough sounds is discouraged due to the potential for sensitive patient information to be leaked during data collection. As a result, privacy-preserving data collection has become a topic of significant interest among researchers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The two aforementioned problems inspire us to give birth to an edge-computing framework that supports the classification of novel cough sounds without collecting a large number of data while still ensuring the security of user data. As illustrated in Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.1 Background and Motivation ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Few-shot Learning for Cough Classification with Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, client data is processed at the periphery of the network, consisting of mobile devices including mobile phones and laptops. To tackle the data scarcity problem, we base on few-shot learning (FSL), which has been receiving a lot of attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2022semantic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">bi2022critical </a></cite> recently. FSL allows us to train a model from an available large dataset, so-called the base set. Then, this model is used to classify novel classes that have not been seen in training while requiring only a few samples of each of novel classes. To address the data security problem, we investigate federated learning, which enables training of models using data located on different local devices owned by local medical centers while effectively protecting medical and health data privacy through parameter exchange. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior study of both few-shot and federated learning on cough sounds yet.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we aim to to develop a method that effectively learns from limited data while maintaining the privacy of patients who provide audio recordings. To achieve this, we employ a combination of few-shot and federated learning techniques. The study begins by preprocessing the cough audio using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The resulting MFCC features are then fed into an embedding network based on ResNet-18 and augmented with an attention mechanism to create embedded vectors, with each class represented by a prototype. The classification task is performed by computing the distances to these prototype representations. Additionally, since the data is stored on multiple devices across various medical centers, the learning of the prototype embedding is conducted in a federated manner, where only the training weights are shared.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

By analyzing unique features of cough sound, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">chatrzarrin2011feature </a></cite> proposed a method to classify dry and wet cough by utilizing the energy and cough frequency spectrum of cough sounds. However, this approach depends on limited features of sound and thus does not generalize diverse cough sounds in reality. Another method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">schroder2016classification </a></cite> adopted a Gaussian Mixture Model and a Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) to classify dry cough, positive cough, and unknown (arbitrary sounds out of cough sounds). Since GMM faces a distribution problem of data, the proposed method is also not effective in the case of diversified cough sounds. For feature extraction, MFCCs have been used in discriminating between dry coughs and wet coughs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">swarnkar2013automatic </a></cite> as well as classifying tuberculosis coughs.</p>

Moreover, we deal with the situation where we have multiple local medical centers, each can collect a few samples of a patient’s cough data.

Intuitively, the two support and query sets are created to mimic the circumstances encountered during real evaluation. In our cough classification context, the support set is the set that has information about the long-established cough sounds and the corresponding labels, which is the prior knowledge that helps to train the model to predict novel labels of data samples in the query set. This idea is based on human learning, for example, a child can utilize knowledge learned from a few sample images of a drawing animal (the support set) to recognize real-world animals (query set).</p>

Each embedding network trained completely in one communication round will be pushed to the cloud layer treated as a server to aggregated weights.

Besides, TD-ResNet7 applies dilated convolutional layers instead of normal convolutional layers. This architecture of TD-ResNet7 performs effectively on normal sequential data such as speech. However, the cough has a cycle that is not as same as other sequential data; therefore, TD-ResNet7 is unable to capture meaningful features of cough sound while our proposed architecture can do better.</p>

<p id="S4.I4.i5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The F1-scores obtained from methods utilizing the F2L setting are significantly higher than those without federated learning. According to the experimental results, leveraging federated learning in cough classification is one of the most suitable manners, which is capable of exploiting as much user data as possible to preserve user privacy and acquire high performance. Consequently, the federated learning scheme is well-suited for applications, which require preserving user privacy and highly accurate precision like health care applications.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that since federated learning is employed for F2LCough, we only synchronize weights of models of local devices without sharing data in each communication round. As a result, our framework can protect the sensitive data of each user.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this study, we proposed a framework called F2LCough, which is a combination of FSL with federated learning to classify cough sounds. Specifically, we built F2LCough upon ResNet-18 architecture with an attention mechanism and designed a federated learning procedure to learn F2LCough. F2LCough was empirically proved to be an effective method in data scarcity situations and also was able to classify novel data not seen in the training process while still preserving data privacy. Specifically, we obtained 0.87 <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pm" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\pm</annotation></semantics></math> 0.02 and 0.85 <math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pm" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">\pm</annotation></semantics></math> 0.02 average F1-Score for <span id="S5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Heavy cold, and sore throat coughing</span> and <span id="S5.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Night wet cough</span>, which act as the novel cough types not seen in the training process.
