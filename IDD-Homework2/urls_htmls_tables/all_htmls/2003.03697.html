<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this overview paper, data-driven learning model-based cooperative localization and location data processing are considered, in line with the emerging machine learning and big data methods. We first review (1) state-of-the-art algorithms in the context of federated learning, (2) two widely used learning models, namely the deep neural network model and the Gaussian process model, and (3) various distributed model hyper-parameter optimization schemes. Then, we demonstrate various practical use cases that are summarized from a mixture of standard, newly published, and unpublished works, which cover a broad range of location services, including collaborative static localization/fingerprinting, indoor target tracking, outdoor navigation using low-sampling GPS, and spatio-temporal wireless traffic data modeling and prediction. Experimental results show that near centralized data fitting- and prediction performance can be achieved by a set of collaborative mobile users running distributed algorithms. All the surveyed use cases fall under our newly proposed <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Localization (FedLoc)</span> framework, which targets on collaboratively building accurate location services without sacrificing user privacy, in particular, sensitive information related to their geographical trajectories. Future research directions are also discussed at the end of this paper.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the explosion of data and the ever-increasing computing power, we have witnessed nowadays the popularity of machine learning models and algorithms which are data-driven. In principal, with more data, an underlying complex system/dynamic/regression function can be closely approximated. However, when the data size increases beyond a limit, both the scale of the model and the computational complexity of an associated learning algorithm can become computationally tough. For instance, the computational complexity for training a Gaussian process model scales cubically with the data size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This renders the required computational load for sophisticated data-driven learning models prohibited for practical cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The recently proposed federated learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has received a lot of attention, as it enables a large-scale machine learning models to be trained jointly by a large number of mobile users through cooperation. Actually, there exist various similar works before the federated learning, for instance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, but federated learning emphasizes more on the following aspects: (1) non-i.i.d. data; (2) unbalanced local data size; (3) large number of local users; (4) limited communication; and (5) data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. It deserves to highlight that federated learning is a promising technical solution to solve the ever-increasing concerns about the loss of user privacy and to meet the ever-stringent data protection regulations world-wide, for instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented by the European Union in 2018. Federated learning has triggered various potential applications in the sectors of smart medicine, finance, and next-generation wireless communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we extend federated learning to a new application sector, namely target localization and location-related services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Target localization is meant to provide an estimate of the desired position as accurate as possible. There exist a plethora of state-of-the-art techniques for static target localization, target tracking, navigation, and interested readers can refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and the references therein for more information. Most of these techniques rely on empirical, parametric transition and measurement models, which can be regarded as an individual abstract of human experience, thus they may severely mismatch the underlying mechanism in complicated environments such as office, shopping mall, museum, etc. However, directly learning from a huge volume of historical data may help alleviating such a model mismatch and improve the positioning accuracy even further.
Apart from the traditional localization service, a new type of location related services have emerged in the recent years under the umbrella of smart cities, namely the spatio-temporal location data prediction. This type of services include, but not limited to, wireless traffic prediction, taxi supply and demand prediction, energy consumption prediction, air pollution prediction at specific locations. Data-driven, learning model-based solutions have demonstrated great data representation and generalization capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the greatest difficulty that we confronted when applying machine learning models to localization and location data modeling lies in the big amount of labeled training data, which can be solved by aggregating small data collected from a large number of mobile users. Yet, such data gathering processes may cause severe data privacy issues, particularly when location is involved. As a special example, during the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen the value of sharing trajectories to track the spread of infections and predicting high-risk regions, meanwhile, there is an urgent need for location privacy preservation of the mobile users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The federated learning framework is an outstanding solution for enhancing wireless localization accuracy and maintaining safe cooperation among users at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The gist of the proposed Federated Localization (FedLoc) framework is to let each mobile user/smart agent collect a smaller scale, local data set and approximate the global machine learning model in a cooperative manner. Some concrete examples are as follows: (1) For static localization, a number of mobile users collect radio features at specific positions obtained either from the global positioning system (GPS) (for outdoor scenarios) or from the proximity to indoor reference points/landmarks (for indoor scenarios); (2) For target tracking and navigation, the mobile users collect diverse trajectories of inertial sensor- and wireless observations; (3) For wireless traffic prediction, base stations work as smart agents to collect local wireless data usage generated by their serving mobile users. We believe that the FedLoc framework is an up-and-coming solution for futuristic data-driven cooperative localization, not only because of the rapid development of distributed optimization techniques that serve as the algorithmic core, but also largely owing to the rapid development of smart phones with ever-increasing computation power and network throughput, the widespread use of quick-response (QR) codes, and the high-precision indoor/outdoor maps, altogether. Therefore, we believe it is timely to exploit all relevant federated learning techniques for localization and location data processing.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This overview paper is a four-mode mixture of review, new proposals, real evaluations, and outlook, being different from the majority that solely review the existing works. We focus on a specific application sector of federated learning, namely the data-driven cooperative localization and location data processing. The models and algorithms to be reviewed are carefully tailored for our desired applications. Besides, we focus on real use cases and their practical implementations from our own works as well as some other related works that all fall under this new cooperative paradigm.

In the first use case, a static target localization system is built based on a DNN that maps a vector of radio features to a desired position. In the second use case, we propose a DNN-based accurate vehicle navigation with low-sampling-rate GPS. In the third case, the state transition function, as represented by the GP model, maps the current state to the next state in a non-parametric way for indoor pedestrian motion modeling. In the fourth use case, wireless traffic is modeled by a scalable GP under 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) infrastructure.

The proposed method was evaluated with two sets of real measurements collected in an indoor environment. This seminal work has triggered a plethora of methods in the following years.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed target tracking is mostly considered for sensor networks without a central node. For such network infrastructures, the traditional Kalman filter or particle filters cannot be used due to lack of the posterior belief/distribution of the desired target state (evolving in time) given all observed sensor measurements. To meet this challenge, various distributed implementations of the Kalman filter and particle filters, for instance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, were proposed with similar ideas of approximating the posterior belief/distribution as a product of local posteriors.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which services are built from a large, relatively open, and often rapidly-evolving group of internet users. Building and maintaining a location system/service based on crowdsourcing is somewhat related to our FedLoc idea. However, the state-of-the-art crowdsourcing methods place more emphasis on raw data sharing and aggregation from a bunch of collaborating users, therefore there is no model in mind. Representative works are as follows. In geography, voluntary users collaboratively build a street map, fill in street information, etc. OpenStreetMap (http://www.openstreetmap.com) and Wikimapia (http:// www.wikimapia.org) are two successful crowdsourcing projects among others. Crowdsourcing of virtual maps, such as RSS map or magnetic map, becomes trendy for big multi-storey buildings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, location data specifically refers to spatio-temporal data measured across space as well as time. Representative spatio-temporal data include environmental data, climate data, transportation data, human mobility data, social data, etc. Spatio-temporal data processing and modeling have been well studied over the past decades, ranging from traditional statistical methods to recent data-driven learning model-based methods. Traditional statistical methods include the autoregressive methods for multivariate random fields, factor analysis methods, stochastic process-based methods, tensor decomposition-based methods, see for instance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Data-driven learning models, such as recurrent neural network with long short-term memory and graph neural network have been used to model spatio-temporal data. A comprehensive survey on harnessing deep learning models for spatio-temporal data mining is given in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. A special note is given here on the Gaussian process model, which is also called Kriging in geostatistics and can be categorized into the traditional statistical models; however, it can also be regarded as a machine learning model for representing a spatial-temporal function with two inputs, namely the location and the time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, Gaussian processes implemented via recursive Kalman filtering are used to model spatio-temporal data with rather low computational complexity. Learning models are believed to be able to generate better modeling and prediction performance compared with the traditional statistical methods. In this work, we are keen on training learning models in a distributed manner by a large number of collaborating mobile users.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Gaussian processes (GP) constitute an important class of Bayesian non-parametric models, which are closely related to several other salient machine learning models. A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables, any finite subset of which follows a Gaussian distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In the sequel, we solely focus on scalar, real-valued Gaussian processes that are completely specified by a mean function and a kernel function (a.k.a. covariance function). Concretely,</p>

In order to make a kernel function full of expressive power and automatically adaptive to a given data set, the following works can be adopted. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, a spectral mixture (SM) kernel was proposed to approximate the spectral density with a Gaussian mixture model arbitrarily well in the frequency domain and transform it back into a universal stationary kernel. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, the authors modified the SM kernel to a linear multiple low-rank sub-kernels with a favorable optimization structure, which enables faster and more stable numerical search.

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous subsections, we briefly introduced DNN and GP that can both be used as the core learning model. DNN is quite popular nowadays due to various good reasons. Among others, it can approximate any smooth function according to the universal approximation theorem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. But the main drawbacks of DNN lie in its opaque model interpretability and the large number of hyper-parameters (DNN weights) to be trained. For our FedLoc framework proposed in this paper, we put more emphasis on the GP models due to their unique welcome features compared with DNN.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.7" class="ltx_p">First, GP models involve significantly fewer model hyper-parameters than an equally-effective DNN. From <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> we know that a single layer Bayesian neural network with i.i.d. weights converges to a GP.

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It can be proven that a sufficiently wide and randomly initialized DNN trained by gradient descent is equivalent to a kernel regression predictor with the aforementioned NTK kernel. Hence, the properties of the ultra-wide DNN, such as the generalization capability, can be obtained by learning the corresponding NTK, albeit with much less computational effort. It is also noteworthy that the hyper-parameter of the NTK is only the number of layers that can be tuned easily using cross-validation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p6.2" class="ltx_p">Second, GP models can handle input uncertainty naturally. In our considered applications, the model inputs often involve position or position related measures that are intrinsically subject to noise due to imperfect field calibration. Since GP model is a probabilistic model, the input uncertainty can be easily incorporated into the model. One way is to assume the training input <math id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{x}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒙</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝒙</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p6.1.m1.1c">\bm{x}</annotation></semantics></math> to be a random variable with a known distribution <math id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p(\bm{x})" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒙</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2"><times id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.2.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1.1">𝒙</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p6.2.m2.1c">p(\bm{x})</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Third, GP models can more easily encode prior information about the data than DNN. This is inherited from the meaningful interpretation of various elementary kernels with known characteristics. For instance, when the data demonstrate periodicity, we could add elementary periodic kernel(s) or locally periodic kernel(s) to the eventual composite kernel; when the data demonstrate linear rising trend, we could add a linear kernel to the eventual kernel; when the data profile is verified to be smooth, we could use the squared-exponential (SE) kernel with a large length scale parameter. Taking into account the prior information about the data can be regarded as regularizing the model fitting process, thus is effective for avoiding data over-fitting. This is a welcome feature for our applications in which the total amount of data is large but each mobile user may only have a small amount of local data in hand for training the global model. According to a recent white paper released by Huawei, wireless big data in 6G will be generated by a huge amount of mobile users and IoT devices, each contributing only a small local data set.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning emphasizes strongly on mobile user’s sole ownership of data and preservation of user privacy. However, recent studies have shown that the shared parameters of the trained models are proved to be vulnerable to disclose sensitive information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>. Privacy preservation in federated learning can be achieved through various security techniques like secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To protect the content of each individual piece of trained model, secure multi-party computation involves multiple participants to upload trained models towards the server collaboratively. No matter DNN or GP is used, the distributed gradient descent on user-held training data is protected by secure aggregation with user dropout taken into consideration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>. By exploiting a secure aggregation protocol and a secret-sharing scheme, the privacy of each user-provided model can be guaranteed under an honest-but-curious and active adversarial setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>, which supports an arbitrary subset of user dropouts. Other than the above schemes, to verify the correctness of the final aggregation result, a privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning protocol has been designed with a homomorphic hash function and a secret sharing protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. However, secure multi-party computation may still leak sensitive information during the learning process.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The key idea of differential privacy in federated learning is to add some “noise” to the trained hyper-parameters with a sensitivity-measured random mechanism, such as Laplace mechanism or Gaussian mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>, which helps mitigate the risk of private information disclosure. However, the injected noise may degrade the performance of the trained model. The feasibility of differential privacy on a client level in federated learning with Gaussian mechanism was demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite>, in which the authors demonstrated the trade-off between the loss of privacy and the modeling performance.</p>

With the additive homomorphic encryption, stochastic gradient descent can be protected against an honest-but-curious central node. Another hybrid scheme combining the differential privacy technique and the threshold homomorphic encryption was designed, which can further resist collusion attacks between the colluding server and participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous sections, we have introduced two important classes of learning models, namely the deep neural network models and Gaussian process models, and a few distributed hyper-parameter optimization schemes tailored to these two models, as well as the state-of-the-art privacy preservation methods for mobile data. These constitute the major ingredients of a novel cooperative, data-driven, learning model-based framework for localization and location data processing.</p>

It is noteworthy that modern smartphones are equipped with a basket of inertial sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, pedometer, barcode/QR code sensors, that can be exploited for localization or localization-related tasks. Apart from the rapid development of the hardware, a number of mobile machine learning platforms are under development, such as Tensorflow by Google, Core ML by Apple, Caffe2 by Facebook, Paddle Lite by Baidu, MNN by Alibaba, etc. Mobile users can easily deploy different deep learning models on their smartphones in the near future.</p>

The edge node first pre-processes the received data and then offloads the model fitting task to a number of computing units. Each edge node is in charge of building a locally-global learning model and transmits the trained hyper-parameters to the core network for consensus and coordinated control. This infrastructure is more suitable for building a number of regional global models for location data processing. The third use case that we will show in the next section can potentially benefit a lot from this edge-based infrastructure.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For land vehicle navigation, combining the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global positioning system (GPS) embedded in a smartphone is still the main-stream technical solution. The GPS can readily provide accurate vehicle positions when the majority of the satellite signals are in line-of-sight (LOS) propagation with relatively high RSS. On the other hand, the IMU assembles, primarily, a three-axis acceleration sensor and a three-axis gyroscope, to determine the position and velocity of a vehicle. The main functionality of the IMU is to provide vehicle positions with a much higher sampling rate (<math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&gt;50" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"></mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">50</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><gt id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></gt><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">absent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">&gt;50</annotation></semantics></math> Hz) between two consequent GPS position estimates (with 1 Hz by default). Unfortunately, when a vehicle enters into certain areas with severe signal blockage, the received GPS signal will be very weak or even undetectable, leading to significantly degraded position estimate. On the other hand, solely relying on low-end IMU measurements for high-accuracy navigation is impractical due to the sensor bias, scale-factor error, and other random errors that accumulate over time. How can we maintain a satisfactory positioning accuracy for the case that GPS signals are occasionally available for harsh wireless environments, such as in the city center or forest? We demand a smart solution with affordable computational complexity.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Towards this end, we introduce in this subsection a machine learning-based approach that can be implemented on commercial smartphones and is able to provide high navigation accuracy using low-end inertial sensors and low-sampling-rate GPS. Inertial sensors are used to continuously estimate the vehicle velocity and position at higher sampling rate, while low-sampling-rate GPS signals are used for IMU calibration occasionally (for example every 60 seconds). When the GPS signal is not available, we use pre-trained DNNs to calibrate the inertial sensor errors.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite> presented a centralized implementation, where interested readers can find more details about the measurements, configurations of the DNNs, as well as a diagram of the whole navigation system. In this paper, we are interested in designing a distributed counterpart. To this end, we let the two DNNs be trained individually by a batch of collaborating mobile users according to Algorithm 1 with the DNN weights optimized using either the FedAvg algorithm or the FedProx algorithm. The information exchange procedure remains the same as the first use case. In the online use phase, the two DNNs will calibrate the inertial sensor error aggregation when there is no GPS signal at hand. Some primary results for this use case will be shown in Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Results ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</p>

To remedy this drawback, some recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>, <a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite> incorporated the variational inference technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> into the standard GPSSM to jointly estimate the GPSSM model hyper-parameters and the latent states on the fly. The variational GPSSM does not require a historical calibrated data set, but as tradeoff it has to deal with a large-scale optimization problem. In order to make it adapt to the FedLoc framework, one may consider using the distributed variational inference techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite> with the GPSSM.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In 5G, wireless traffic prediction is vital to resource allocation, load-aware management, and proactive control in C-RAN. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, we proposed a distributed GP-based wireless traffic modeling and prediction framework that exploits the advanced C-RAN specifying the edge-based network infrastructure given in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Network Infrastructures for FedLoc ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. In the deployment area, several hundreds of micro base stations with fixed geographical positions are installed to serve mobile users and record the downlink physical resource block (PRB) usage (a wireless traffic usage indicator) versus time. In this work, the base stations serving as smart agents are first clustered into groups according to their geographical locations, and for each group an aggregated PRB usage prediction model is to be built. To this end, all the micro base stations in one cluster send their observed time series of PRB usage to an edge node, in which the data are aggregated, pre-processed and uniformly allocated to a number of parallel computing units.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the above work, we considered a temporal GP for regression. Therein, each cluster of base stations is assumed to be independent other clusters. For enhanced prediction performance, we could use spatio-temporal GP that takes into account the correlations between different clusters. A straightforward way for building a spatio-temporal GP model is to introduce an extra kernel to account for the spatial correlations between different clusters and combine this spatial kernel with the aforementioned temporal kernel either through addition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite> or Kronecker product <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The recently proposed graph GP provides another way for learning from high-dimensional data points living on non-Euclidean domains, see for instance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite>. As such, graph GP allows for better non-local generalization thus can be used to model sophisticated correlation patterns across time and space. In the illustrating example in Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.4 GP-Based Wireless Traffic Modeling and Prediction ‣ 6 Use Cases of FedLoc ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, a graph GP can be designed to capture three types of correlations, including: (1) temporal correlation as discussed above; and (2) spatial-temporal correlation, where closer geographical distance indicates higher correlation in the temporal observations, and (3) the event correlation, where an event nearby also indicates a higher probability of an abrupt traffic change. It is noteworthy that graph GP is still under development where many directions remain to be explored, e.g., kernel design, stability issue, and distributed processing among others.</p>

The proposed FedLoc framework can be used by a number of collaborating mobile users to build accurate radio feature maps, such as RSS map and magnetic field map, for indoor venues. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>, we proposed a distributed, recursive GP framework for building indoor RSS maps. Therein, a batch of mobile users was employed to collect RSS measurements from a dozen of WiFi access points at Ericsson research, Linkoping, Sweden. In the training phase, each mobile user trains a local GP empowered RSS map individually, while in the inference phase a global prediction is obtained by fusing all the local GP models via the classical Bayesian committee machine. A follow-up work was then proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>. These works can be revised to fit a global GP model in the training phase using the ADMM-based GP hyper-parameter optimization algorithm introduced in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Federated Localization (FEDLOC) ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

We could potentially modify the GPSSM framework for the federated SLAM.

The commercial 5G network and futuristic wide-band generations (B5G and 6G) could make the federated SLAM possible. Some recent attempt in this regard can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>.</p>

So far we have solely considered ground applications. In addition, there will be a plethora of emerging OoT applications that can benefit from our FedLoc framework. We show a conceptual picture of OoT in Fig. <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.5 Other Potential Use Cases ‣ 6 Use Cases of FedLoc ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, where the whole network comprises a large number of spatially distributed buoys, some moving ships and UAVs, and satellites. The buoys are analogous to micro base stations on the ground, serving as smart agents, and they can perform data collection and monitor local environment. New fashioned buoys will be equipped with different sensors, ranging devices, GPS, and low-profile AI chips. They can be used to measure the ocean surface temperature, sea state, sound speed, etc, and track multi-target trajectories. The measured local data can be uploaded either to a moving ship or a moving UAV, which can be regarded as edge node. In addition to information transmission, the UAVs can also be used to charge the buoys if they are wireless powered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>, <a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite>. Each edge node maintains a local update of the learning model for spatio-temporal data processing and transmits the hyper-parameter estimate to the satellite cloud for consensus. In contrast to the ground IoT applications, the buoys may have insufficient on-board processing capability and relatively short communication range compared with a micro base station. However, the communication channels on the sea are mostly in line-of-sight. Since the buoys may be owned by different operators, privacy-preservation can not be ignored either.</p>

On one hand, the pxADMM-GP scheme circumvents frequent gradient synchronizations and used less iterations toward convergence than the cADMM-GP scheme. On the other hand, the closed-form proximal update w.r.t. the local hyper-parameters only requires to compute the expensive matrix inversion once.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will demonstrate the application of FedLoc with DNN models for smart vehicle navigation using low-sampling-rate GPS signals, which was introduced as a representative use case in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Use Cases of FedLoc ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We start by introducing the implementation setups of our new proposed federated learning empowered navigation system prototype. First, real data sets (for both training and test) were collected by three collaborating users with their own private car driving on the campus of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), see Fig. <a href="#S7.F16" title="Figure 16 ‣ 7.2 Outdoor Vehicle Navigation with Low-Sampling-Rate GPS ‣ 7 Results ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>. During the data collection process, each car was equipped with a smartphone (Xiaomi), facing upwards and heading to the moving direction of the car. The sensor data were uploaded to the server through WiFi on the fly. These three collaborating users traveled around the campus and collected various trajectories of smartphone sensory data that contain real-time motion information of their vehicles. The duration of each trajectory ranges from a few minutes to dozens of minutes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">After collecting all training data sets, we adopted the FedLoc framework to train the two DNNs as was introduced in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Use Cases of FedLoc ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> for calibrating the sensor data, one for the velocity and the other one for the yaw angle, so that accurate navigation can be obtained even with low-sampling-rate GPS signals. Two DNNs with five hidden layers (3000-3000-2000-1000-500) are selected as the global model in our prototype, which can be replaced with more sophisticated models, such as the LSTM, for high-dimensional time series. The input is the sensor data measured in a specific time window with dimension 600 for the first DNN or with dimension 401 for the second DNN, while the output is a scalar. In the training phase, the global model is updated by the three collaborating users according to Algorithm 1. Specifically, we tried two different model training algorithms, namely the FedAvg algorithm and the FedProx algorithm introduced in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Federated Localization (FEDLOC) ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

Both algorithms can achieve a low training loss after a certain number of epochs. In our experiments, the FedProx algorithm unfortunately did not demonstrate smoother and more stable convergence profile than that of the FedAvg algorithm. The reason may lie in the improper setting of the regularization parameter of the FedProx algorithm, which is supposed to help achieve good trade off between the training loss and the discrepancy between the global model and local ones.</p>

The GPS reference signals are only available every 60 seconds, being much less frequent than the default setup (1 sample per second). During the time where there is no GPS signal available, the trained global learning models are used to calibrate the observed sensor data. For the i.i.d. and balanced data setup mentioned in Table <a href="#S7.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 7.2 Outdoor Vehicle Navigation with Low-Sampling-Rate GPS ‣ 7 Results ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we show the test performance in Fig. <a href="#S7.F18" title="Figure 18 ‣ 7.2 Outdoor Vehicle Navigation with Low-Sampling-Rate GPS ‣ 7 Results ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>. For this case, the FedAvg algorithm is modestly superior to the FedProx algorithms in the test phase. The navigation RMSE of the FedAvg is around 9 meters, while around 12 meters for the FedProx algorithm on average. Fine-tuning the learning rate of the FedProx algorithm may further improve its generalization performance. For the non-i.i.d and imbalanced data setup shown in Table <a href="#S7.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 7.2 Outdoor Vehicle Navigation with Low-Sampling-Rate GPS ‣ 7 Results ‣ FedLoc: Federated Learning Framework for Data-Driven Cooperative Localization and Location Data Processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is obvious that the FedAvg algorithm failed with a significantly degraded navigation RMSE equal to 34 meters, while the FedProx algorithm worked well with a navigation RMSE around 17 meters.

<p id="S8.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An essential ingredient of the federated wireless localization framework is the mobile terminals. To ensure that the whole framework works smoothly, the mobile terminals should be able to process a modest amount of data and perform analysis with TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. This requires further development of powerful but compressed deep learning models, mobile AI chips, etc. Advanced WiFi and 5G technologies can fulfill the communication requirements between the mobile terminals and the central node. However, communication efficiency is a critical issue that requires more attention. In addition, an agreement on the standard protocol for synchronizing the mobile terminals is to be made. Interested readers may refer to a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> on how to design a scalable production system for federated learning.</p>

A more straightforward and practical way to reduce the communication burden is to quantize the DNN weights from 64 bits precision to 8 bits precision or even lower. In the context of distributed optimization, a signSGD method was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite> that quantizes every gradient update to it’s binary sign thus reducing the communication load by a factor of 32.

This may not be true for voluntary users with very limited amount of local data. One effective way to alleviate this “small data” difficulty from algorithmic perspective is to harness the full basket of known canonical parametric models to generate some virtual data and mix them with the small batch of real data before training the model. In this way, we are able to transfer the prior knowledge of the canonical models to our desired data-driven, learning-based model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this overview paper, we reviewed all required building blocks of a fundamentally new cooperative localization and location data processing framework, called FedLoc. Being different from most of the overview papers, we put more effort on real use cases of the FedLoc framework as well as their practical implementations. We strongly believe that the FedLoc framework is promising for the following good reasons. First, high-precision wireless localization is desperately demanded, which can be achieved by combining empirical models with data driven models. Second, calibrating a localization algorithm often consumes a lot of time and workforce, and collaboration among mobile users can largely facilitate the calibration effort. Third, smartphones are becoming a powerful platform for heavy computations. Fourth, we have seen rapid development in large-scale non-convex optimization techniques, 5G communication networks, data encryption, among other emerging techniques. Lastly and most importantly, data privacy issue can be well addressed by the federated learning framework so that mobile users dare to share their location related information with safeguard.</p>
