<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, an innovative network architecture designed to safeguard user privacy, is gaining widespread adoption in the realm of technology. However, given the existence of backdoor attacks in federated learning, exploring the security of federated learning is significance. Nevertheless, the backdoors investigated in current federated learning research can be readily detected by human inspection or resisted by detection algorithms. Accordingly, a new goal has been set to develop stealing and robust federated learning backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SAB, tailored specifically for backdoor attacks in federated learning, presenting an alternative gradient updating mechanism. SAB attack based on steganographic algorithm, using image steganographic algorithm to build a full-size trigger to improve the accuracy of backdoors and use multiple loss joint computation to produce triggers. SAB exhibits smaller distances to benign samples and greater imperceptibility to the human eye. As such, our triggers are capable of mitigating or evading specific backdoor defense methods. In SAB, the bottom-95% method is applied to extend the lifespan of backdoor attacks. It updates the gradient on minor value points to reduce the probability of being cleaned. Finally, the generalization of backdoors is enhanced with Sparse-update to improve the backdoor accuracy.</p>

. In these application fields, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are widely used and generate a large amount of actual data anytime, anywhere, as cameras in smart cities are used to record real-time information on the street, location sensors in automatic driving are used to assist automatic driving in combination with high-definition maps, sensors in intelligent traffic are used to determine vehicle speed and the number of vehicles. Before we use deep learning, the model must be trained using a large amount of data. It leads to some problems which exist in the model itself will be exploited by adversaries, such as adversarial attacks

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, considering the huge demand for training data when training models, models cannot achieve optimal results if the amount of training data is not enough. And the privacy issues involved in data result in the inability to obtain data directly from IoT devices which results in companies and organizations with large amounts of data cannot legally share these data to promote the training of models. Consequently, many isolated data islands are created. To solve the problem of isolated data islands, Brendan McMahan of Google et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a new computational paradigm for deep learning, called federated learning. This new computing paradigm can be well applied in IoT scenarios, bringing realistic and good training data to the model without leaking sensitive data from IoT devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning is a new computational paradigm, it mostly follows the ideas of deep learning and has characteristics of deep learning. That makes it be affected by attacks in deep learning, such as adversarial attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and data poisoning attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. And because of its characteristics, some new attacks have been derived, such as distributed backdoor attacks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Whether federated learning or not, most backdoor attacks such as the approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, will put a trigger into the image. Most of these attacks are easily detectable by the human eye and difficult to resist existing backdoor defense methods, and even more difficult to apply in the real world. During the continuous training of these backdoors, the model overwritten by poisoned gradients. Our approach introduces an image-based steganographic algorithm trigger in federated learning, making the trigger hidden in the benign sample and challenging to distinguish visually. The trigger is related to the benign sample and scattered in all regions of the image, making the trigger not easy to be cleaned. Since federated learning continuously aggregates all client gradients before updating the global model. It will cause the backdoor to be continuously cleaned by benign gradients during model training. We change the location of the gradient updates according to this feature to make our backdoor have a longer survival time. And our triggers only make small changes to the image, it is harder to be detected. In addition, the introduction of aggregated gradients in the federated learning paradigm makes it difficult to ensure that smaller gradients can successfully affect the model itself after aggregation, so the effectiveness of triggers based on small values needs to be verified.

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary contribution of this study resides in the introduction of a pioneering approach to model updates within the realm of federated learning, furnishing a novel perspective tailored specifically for addressing backdoor vulnerabilities. By leveraging the bottom-95% and sparse-update techniques, we empower our controlled data to engender a heightened impact on the model, ensuring its enduring and unwavering integration within the model’s architecture. Our proposed methodology exhibits particular efficacy in the context of thwarting backdoor attacks. Full-size triggers, in our method, can effectively utilize the bottom-95% gradient update locations to conceal the backdoor in an imperceptible manner. By combining this approach with the Sparse-update method, the backdoor gradient update ratio can be adjusted, thus enhancing the robustness of the backdoor. Consequently, the impact of the backdoor becomes less substitutable by benign samples, significantly augmenting both the duration and accuracy of the backdoor. We refer to our overall approach as SAB, showcasing its comprehensive efficacy.</p>

The main one is adversarial sample that acts on the inference phase of the model to makes the model less effective. Data poisoning attack aims to destroy the model and make it hard to be trained and unusable. On the other hand, backdoor attack makes the model’s accuracy in the main task nondecreasing, although for some specific samples, the model classifies as the adversary’s desired category. That means backdoor attacks is stealthier and more deceptive, and it presents a challenge for users to detect the existence of backdoors. Thus, deploying the model with backdoors to make the model produce the adversary’s desired results in practical applications, will cause unknowable results and make it more threatening.</p>

In Poison Ink<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, an adversary will first use an edge extraction algorithm to extract the edge of an image.

The method forward-propagates the original input of the image and then does guided backprop one time.

The key idea is that when the image does not contain a backdoor trigger, the output of the model will change when the detector adds a strong perturbation to the image. When the input contains a trigger, the inference of model is independent of how much perturbation has been added to the image. If the detector adds a strong perturbation to the image with trigger, the model will still categorize the image as the target class expected by the adversary, and this non-change is considered an anomaly. When a perturbation is added to a benign image, the change in the model’s prediction of image is related to strength of added perturbation. By adding different patterns to the image, the model produces different results, and the distribution of entropy for each set of results is then calculated. This can be found, when a trigger is added to image, the distribution of the entropy of the model output prediction results between the benign sample and poisoned sample will be more different. It can be easily distinguished between the poisoned image with the trigger implanted and the benign image by setting a threshold value.</p>

The gradient with the noise added can no longer represent 100% of the direction of the model update, making the trained model carry a certain error to attenuate the impact brought by the backdoor attack. Whereas the correct gradient will be affected by the perturbation as well, the accuracy of main task is reduced to varying degrees, thus affecting the performance of the model. Although differential privacy can reduce the accuracy of the backdoor attacks. Owing to the negative impact on the precision of benign samples, a minor perturbation is commonly incorporated.</p>

Consequently, federated learning can optimize the generalization degree of the model by dropping some optimization information. The degree of model dropout is directly proportional to the strength of its resistance against adversarial attacks induced by backdoor samples. This is attributed to the fact that the perturbed gradients are subjected to dropout as well. Dropout refers to the process of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization, in which the weight of the gradient is randomly set to zero.</p>

Moreover, attackers are permitted to modify and upload their gradient directly, even to the extent of violently changing its value.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that we consider two cases. One is that when organizations such as enterprises, hospitals, schools, and government agencies have the need to train a machine learning model, they need entrust the training task of the model to a company with arithmetic power (outsourcing company). Considering the large number of organizations and the sensitive data they hold, it is incapable to share their data. In such situations, an outsourcing company may have a certain degree of influence and can be chosen to gain the trust of these organizations through federated learning. Then the outsourcing company can obtain the gradients of sensitive data and update model, make model better meet the needs of these organizations. However, outsourcing companies can carefully constructed it to implant a backdoor in the model. The second scenario involves us acting solely as a client for federated learning, receiving the model, using local data to update it, and uploading the updates to a central server. The key difference between the two scenarios lies in the fact that, in the first case, we can make changes to the global model of federated learning and the aggregation method, whereas in the second case, we can only make changes to the local model and the uploaded model updates.</p>

However, current federated learning backdoor attacks have a noticeable and easily detectable trigger, although some triggers are distributed in appearance. They can be detected by visual inspection, while such triggers may be hard to apply to the physical world. Thus, these backdoors are removed along with the federated learning process.
We desire the trigger to be stealthy, hard to detect by eyes, able to survive for a long lifespan in the training process of federated learning, and robust against some defenses.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_paragraph">Why does the steganographic algorithm work?</h4>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In existing work, we have found that a significant number of current backdoor attacks use a fixed image as the trigger, and these triggers are placed in specific location in the image. According to the principle of convolutional neural network, it is known that these triggers will eventually be transformed into partial features. The position of these features will not be changed in different images. Therefore, when local clients are trained with backdoor images containing fixed triggers during the federated learning training process, the gradients affected by the backdoor will always appear at fixed locations. When these gradients are uploaded, there is a probability that the content of the gradients at these fixed locations will even be blurred to zero, when the central server deploys some defense methods such as DP and PartFedAvg. This is a major limitation of the application of existing methods in federated learning. Increasing the number of blurred or zeroed gradients can cause fixed triggers to fail immediately, making it challenging for these attack methods to avoid defense mechanisms like DP and PartFedAvg. Hence, finding a backdoor that is challenging to eliminate is crucial. Additionally, in real-world implementations of backdoor attacks, it is necessary to ensure that the backdoors are difficult to detect by the human eye.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an approach for a federated learning backdoor attack based on image steganographic algorithm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the attack can be a suitable approach for our needs. We do not simply fix the trigger at a certain location on the image. Instead, we resize the trigger to a size comparable to the image itself and overlay it onto the image. Furthermore, our attack can make the trigger size comparable to the image, while it is challenging for the victim to detect the anomaly. The trigger is equivalent to a complete image for the model, and the model will map the trigger to the class specified by the adversary. This is similar to an image classification model, which, unlike other existing methods, does not correspond to a small trigger or a few data points to the target class. Instead, like a dataset of image classification, it learns a large number of trigger features. The trigger should not overfit while being learned, so we use an overfitting prevention method to enhance the success rate of the backdoor attack. This approach ensures that the failure of triggers does not occur abruptly due to the overwriting of certain data points, which underlies our method’s high stealthiness and robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, in the context of federated learning, a backdoor attack is usually set for a certain number of rounds and stops after completing the specified number of rounds. After stopping, the success rate of the backdoor attack decreases as the number of model training rounds continues to increase. We refer to the number of rounds during which the backdoor remains effective as the lifespan. The decrease in attack success rate is because the gradient impact of backdoor attacks is cleaned by benign samples. We utilized two methods to extend the lifespan. The first method is called bottom-95% method, which involves continuously uploading the gradient during the training process of federated learning. The larger the gradient value, the stronger the impact on the model. On account of the attacker’s backdoor gradient updates in the top-5% large values will not be uploaded. The model will be completely updated in benign clients, and the backdoor gradient will be hidden in the bottom-95%. The data points in the bottom-95% will not be frequently updated or updated with smaller values, which can reduce the chance of the gradient being overwritten. The second method is Sparse-update, which randomly sets the updated gradient to zero. When the gradient of the trigger position is set to zero, the effect of the trigger will be greatly reduced. However, since our trigger covers the whole image, it will take time to be eliminated because of the Sparse-update. Moreover, this method improves the generalizability of the backdoor.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">Based on the inherent characteristics of federated learning and the specificity of application scenarios. When studying backdoor attacks for federated learning, it is a question worth exploring how to obtain a higher attack lifespan or a slower decay rate of attack success rate using fewer attacks within a limited attack round. In our study, we were inspired by Neurotoxin<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and find that gradients containing attacks can be cleaned more slowly when updated on the gradient with the smallest value, result in the attacks to survive longer in the model. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the disparity between the backdoor gradient value and the benign gradient value, with the former exerting a persistent dominant influence in relation to the gradients generated by benign clients. The backdoor gradient corresponding to the position where the benign gradient value is relatively smaller is uploaded. Although the model attempts to mitigate the excessive impact of each customer’s gradient through an averaging algorithm, the influence of the backdoor gradient remains substantial compared to the impact of benign samples. Consequently, it proves challenging to effectively evade the repercussions brought about by the backdoor gradient. Such an idea can be well integrated with our approach. Our trigger is a residual image of the same size as the dataset image and be spread over the whole picture. It will apply the impact of triggers on the maximum value within the bottom-95% of the data points. That makes triggers be decoupled from top-5% of data points. Top-5% data points will not be uploaded as part of the triggers and will only be updated as zero. The updates as triggers will be avoided to be covered quickly by the updates of benign samples because of the two reasons of decreasing update frequency and small update values. The gradient is calculated, and the model is updated as Eq.(<a href="#S3.E7" title="In Lengthen Lifespan. ‣ 3.2 Approach ‣ 3 Method ‣ SAB:A Stealing and Robust Backdoor Attack based on Steganographic

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">PartFedAvg is commonly used as a defensive method for backdoor. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> PartFedAvg has been convergent in both the i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. cases respectively. We take inspiration from this and propose a method called <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sparse-update</span>. It will blur the gradient by randomly and set the update of partial gradient to <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">zero</span> to improve the security and attack success rate of the model. That is, it will still have a defensive function and part of defense method will use this kind of ideal to fortify security. The reason we use this method is that we try to increase our backdoor lifespan by this method. The sparse-update approach selectively removes a mere 20% of the data points. Moreover, owing to the utilization of the Bottom-95% technique, the remaining 80% of data points, which are unaffected by the sparse-update method, may not necessarily comprise backdoor data points. This allows our backdoor method to conceal itself more effortlessly within the updates. It makes Sparse-update elevate the generalization of the backdoor attack and increase the success rate of the backdoor attack. Benefiting from our trigger affects all the data points. Sparse-update and Bottom-95% methods can be combined. Our method will lengthen lifespan first and Sparse-update on top of it Eq.(<a href="#S3.E9" title="In Gradient upload method. ‣ 3.2 Approach ‣ 3 Method ‣ SAB:A Stealing and Robust Backdoor Attack based on Steganographic Algorithm against Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>), which will make the attack method in this paper improve generalization and an extended lifespan. The overall success rate of the attack is elevated.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In summary, this study endeavors to build full-size triggers while rendering them imperceptible to the naked eye. During injection, they are embedded in sparsely updated data points, and during gradient propagation, only 80% of the gradients is randomly transmitted. Consequently, our triggers are based on full-size implementation, selectively sampling data points as triggers within the less frequently updated regions. Throughout the iterative process, two primary challenges arise: 1. limited scope of the triggers, and 2. frequent updates to trigger locations. When the triggers exhibit a small spatial range, for instance, a fixed 5x5 pixel block, the rapid obliteration of the trigger’s influence occurs with each update to its location, rendering the backdoor entirely ineffective. In contrast, as exemplified by the SAB method, when triggers are stochastically dispersed across the entire image and updated with lower probability, the backdoor exhibits prolonged persistence, augmented robustness, and enhanced accuracy.</p>

It is a dataset about fashion items, which internally contains a total of 70,000 images from 10 categories, each image is 28 * 28 pixels in size and is grayscale. There are 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. The size and type of the Fashion-MNIST images are identical to MNIST, and the authors have produced it by positioning Fashion-MNIST as a replacement for MNIST to be used in machine learning. In order to make it as easy as possible for users to replace MNIST with Fashion-MNIST as convenient as possible, the splitting structure inside the data of both datasets is the same. It is even possible to directly overwrite the MNIST file with the Fashion-MNIST file when replacing it.</p>

Among them, 50,000 are the training set and 10,000 are the test set. In the 6 packages of datasets, there are 5 train batches, and 1 test batch, each batch include 10,000 images. The test batch contains 1000 images from each class. Train batch contains the remaining images in random order, the 10 classes in each batch contain uneven images, possibly some of these classes are completely mutually repulsive in CIFAR-10. For example, there is no overlap between cars and trucks. The class "car" includes things like cars, SUVs, and so on, and "Trucks" includes only large trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.</p>

It is a network model that is widely used in deep learning and proposed by four scholars from Microsoft Research as a convolutional neural network. In deep learning, as the number of layers increases, the probability of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion increase when model back-propagates gradient. ResNet mitigates this problem by using jump connections in the internal residual blocks, and the network is easy to optimize and easy to enhance its accuracy by increasing the number of layers. It won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2015 for image classification and object recognition.

BadNets is a typical example of backdoor attack in deep learning. It will adds patches to sample. DBA is a new backdoor attack based on federated learning with distributed trigger. For defense, we use STRIP, DP, and Grad-CAM to evaluate the performance of our approach against some defense methods. To imitate BadNets, we added an obvious trigger in the corner of image. In cifar10 and cifar100, added a 5 * 5 pixel white block with a black cross filled in the center of the white block. And in Fashion-MNIST, we added a mosaic-style black and white block in the bottom right corner as a trigger. In the DBA method, we add 4 blocks of trigger in the top left corner of cifar10, cifar100, and Fashion-MNIST, each block is 1 * 2 pixels in size and there is at least 1 pixel spacing between the left, right, top, and bottom adjacent trigger. It is worth noting that the trigger we insert in cifar10 and cifar100 are colored triggers, which are four different colors. In comparison, while Fashion-MNIST itself is a grayscale map, we insert four different grayscale values in Fashion-MNIST, they all have a difference of at least greater than 30.</p>

To reducing the possibility of our attack being cleaned in the constant model updates and increase the lifespan, we limit the range of gradient updates to the <em id="S4.SS2.p2.6.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bottom-95%</em> of each gradient value, the gradient value of <em id="S4.SS2.p2.6.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">top-5%</em> will not be updated during the attack. Specifically, we will set the <em id="S4.SS2.p2.6.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">top-5%</em> gradient value to zero. When the parameters of the model are aggregated, the effect of the backdoor in <em id="S4.SS2.p2.6.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">top-5%</em> is not carried. However, gradients from other benign clients affect the model normally. A backdoor attack differs from a poisoning attack. Poisoning attacks only expect the model to produce false predictions, while backdoor attacks require the model to produce false predictions that match the attacker’s expectations. Our attack method can produce different triggers based on a different string, and thus can fix a string by a class to produce a class trigger. Sparse-update can enhance ASR by blurring the gradient and reduce the impact of each client on the global model. When updating, the upload limit is set to 20%, clients will randomly set zero to the 20% gradient uploaded.</p>

Our method is better than both methods in terms of ASR and lifespan. After the attack is stopped, the ASR of SAB does not lose efficacy rapidly, and it can maintain high ASR for a period. Although it will become invalid after a long period, the overall ASR of the backdoor test is still higher than baseline method, and the trend of decrease effectiveness is smoother than baseline method, which means it can survive longer.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In both existing centralized and distributed federated learning attack methods, a conspicuous trigger is generated at a fixed location, leading to certain challenges in the system’s security and robustness. One issue is that these conspicuous triggers can be easily detected by the human eye. In sensitive fields, such as autonomous driving, there are standards for traffic signs such as stop signs, which can be recognized easily by both humans and machines if there is a trigger in it. When training data contains images with similar mosaics or other patterns that do not belong to the stop sign, the model trainer can easily pick out these images and exclude them from training. This type of attack may be theoretically effective, how to deploy in a real-world environment remains a problem. The second issue is that for computers, processed images are transformed into tensors for learning. In general, attack triggers are usually fixed at a specific location. After an image is transformed into a tensor, the data points in the image are fixed in these particular locations within the tensor. For instance, the bottom-right data point of an image will be mapped to the last few data points in the tensor. This characteristic causes the attack triggers to be fixed at a particular location even after being transformed into tensors. In order for the attack to be effective, the attacker needs to add triggers to all samples so that the model associates specific values at specific locations with the targeted class, causing the model to output the specified class when it detects those values at those locations. However, this makes it easy for some backdoor defense methods to detect these backdoors.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper attempts to implement a backdoor attack using a steganographic algorithm in federated learning. In this method, a string is embedded into an image as a trigger using steganographic algorithm, which makes it difficult for the human eye to distinguish whether the trigger exists in the image or not. In federated learning, the key is that the method does not exchange the entire dataset. This means that only the client itself knows whether the trigger is present in the image, unless there are conspicuous pixels in the image. Based on steganography, the trigger used in this method is not as conspicuous as those used in BadNets and DBA approaches. Even if a stranger is given benign samples and images with SAB triggers to distinguish, it is not easy to discriminate which image is poisonous. The SAB-generated backdoor images are challenging to discern by the human eye. Nonetheless, our method retains strong concealment from a computer’s perspective, as explicated in Sections C and D of this chapter.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we deployed bottom-95% and Sparse-update techniques to enhance the accuracy and lifespan of backdoors. Bottom-95% means that only uploading the smaller 95% of the gradient value when updating the gradients containing malicious content. Meanwhile, benign updates are retained in the top-5% of gradient values. As the gradients containing backdoors and those without backdoors typically differ significantly, the location of the maximum data point in the gradients containing backdoors and those without them are often different. During model aggregation, there are different gradient values from different clients for the same data point, and the benign gradients are typically smaller than the backdoor gradients. This results in the backdoor gradients dominating during aggregation, making aggregation algorithm can not remove the backdoor, allowing it to be implanted in the model. Since the backdoor is always implanted in positions where the benign gradient values are small, even after the attack is over and the benign gradients continue to update normally, the influence of the backdoor gradient will not be eliminated in a short time because benign updates do not cause significant changes in the gradient. For normal samples, uploading sparse gradients is an effective method to prevent gradient leakage attacks and membership inference attacks, and has certain defense capabilities against typical backdoor attacks. We found that if we deploy Sparse-update, our attack method has a certain degree of ASR improvement and prolongs the survival time of the backdoor. We believe that this is profit by the fact that our trigger size is comparable to the image size, small-scale gradient modifications like 20% cannot eliminate the effects of SAB backdoors. Our trigger overlaid on the sample creates a new complete image, which allows the model to map more features to the target class when learning the SAB backdoor sample. While this approach can result in greater redundancy in our trigger, excessive training iterations will lead to overfitting. Using sparse updates is an effective way to prevent overfitting of the trigger. By discarding 20% of the updates, the remaining 80% of updates are sufficient for the model to recognize the backdoor. In our experiments, 20% was found to be the optimal proportion to discard. When the proportion of discarded parameters exceeds 20%, the effectiveness of the backdoor is noticeably reduced. Thus, even if Sparse-update gives up some parameter updates, will make Sparse-update’s defense function much less effective and our backdoor will not be significantly affected.</p>

When the defender finds that the model focuses on a fixed area in the image when predicting, it is easy to infer that the model is embedded with a backdoor and contains a fixed trigger in the image.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Today’s federated learning backdoors are based on significant triggers, which can be easily identified and predicted by some defense methods. Also, these poisoned samples can be easily identified artificially. Despite recent advancements, the application of backdoor technique in the physical world remains problematic. For example, in the field of autonomous driving, when a white block appears on a sign, it can easily be considered a sign that is not conducive to the correct identification of the model. It will be replaced by a clean sign. A such significant trigger-based backdoor is strenuous to be truly deployed in the physical world. Instead, we propose an image steganography-based approach by jointly computing multiple losses to derive the most intricate trigger to detect by the eye. SAB works better and applies it in federated learning. It makes a trigger which size same as the image size and will be implanted in the bottom-95% of the gradient of the model update, which greatly improves attack success rate of the backdoor. And it enables to be implanted faster and survive for a longer period. At the same time, thanks to the full-size triggers of SAB, the backdoor can attenuate the influence of DP on it and can evade the defenses of STRIP and Grad-Cam.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We only encode one trigger for the image using the real label content of the image even though we can encode different triggers by changing the text content. In future work, we can try multiple triggers for one image to make more threats hidden in the model. Although we have studied the invisible triggers for application in the physical world, the triggers in this study have not experimented in the physical world. In the future, we will expand the pixels of sample to make the images clearer for real testing at the physical level.</p>
