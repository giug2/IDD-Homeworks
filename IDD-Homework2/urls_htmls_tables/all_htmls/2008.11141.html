<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We study federated learning (FL), where power-limited wireless devices utilize their local datasets to collaboratively train a global model with the help of a remote parameter server (PS).
The PS has access to the global model and shares it with the devices for local training using their datasets, and the devices return the result of their local updates to the PS to update the global model.<span id="footnotex1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnotetext"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">0</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">0</sup><span class="ltx_note_type">footnotetext: </span>This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-0939370, and by the European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant BEACON (grant agreement no. 677854).</span></span></span>
The algorithm continues until the convergence of the global model.
This framework requires downlink transmission from the PS to the devices and uplink transmission from the devices to the PS.
The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the bandwidth-limited shared wireless medium in both the downlink and uplink on the performance of FL with a focus on the downlink.
To this end, the downlink and uplink channels are modeled as fading broadcast and multiple access channels, respectively, both with limited bandwidth.
For downlink transmission, we first introduce a digital approach, where a quantization technique is employed at the PS followed by a capacity achieving channel code to transmit the global model update over the wireless broadcast channel at a common rate such that all the devices can decode it.
Next, we propose analog downlink transmission, where the global model is broadcast by the PS in an uncoded manner.
We consider analog transmission over the uplink in both cases, since its superiority over digital transmission for uplink has been well studied in the literature.
We further analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed analog transmission approach over the downlink assuming that the uplink transmission is error-free.
Numerical experiments show that the analog downlink approach provides significant improvement over the digital one, despite a significantly lower transmit power at the PS, with a more notable improvement when the data distribution across the devices is not independent and identically distributed.
The experimental results corroborate the convergence results, and show that a smaller number of local iterations should be used when the data distribution is more biased, and also when the devices have a better estimate of the global model in the analog downlink approach.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless devices, such as mobile phones, wearables, and Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, continuously generate massive amounts of data.
This massive data can be processed to infer the state of a system, or to anticipate its future states with applications in autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or extended reality (XR) technologies. Due to the growing storage and computational capabilities of wireless edge devices, it is increasingly attractive to store and process the data locally by shifting network computations to the edge.
Also, in contrast to traditional machine learning (ML) solutions, it is not desirable to offload such massive amounts of data available at the wireless edge devices to a cloud server for centralized processing due to latency, bandwidth, and power constraints in wireless networks, as well as privacy concerns of users.
<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</span> (FL) has emerged as an alternative method enabling ML at the wireless network edge by utilizing wireless edge computational capabilities to process data locally.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL the goal is to fit a global model to data generated and stored locally at the wireless devices by exploiting edge processing capabilities collaboratively with the help of a remote parameter server (PS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
The PS keeps track of the global model, which is updated using the local model updates received from the participating devices, and shares it with the devices for training using their local data.
When FL is employed at the wireless edge, the PS can be a wireless access point or a base station, and the communication between the PS and the devices takes place over the shared wireless medium with limited energy and bandwidth.
There have been several studies to develop distributed ML techniques with communication constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
However, these studies focus on limiting the uplink communication from the devices to the PS by assuming rate-limited error-free links, and do not take into consideration the physical layer characteristics of the wireless medium.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently there have been efforts to develop a federated edge learning (FEEL) framework considering the physical layer aspects of the underlying wireless medium.
FL over power- and bandwidth-limited multiple access channel (MAC) for the uplink is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and novel digital and analog transmission techniques at the wireless devices are proposed.
While the former employs gradient sparsification followed by quantization and channel coding for digital transmission, the latter utilizes the superposition property of the underlying wireless MAC, and introduces a novel bandwidth-efficient transmission technique employing sparsification and linear projection.
FL over a broadband wireless fading MAC is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where the devices have channel state information (CSI) to perform channel inversion, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposes analog transmission over the wireless fading MAC without any power control.
The extension of the approach introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to the wireless fading MAC studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which combines the linear projection idea of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> with power control.
Furthermore, FL over wireless networks with a multi-antenna PS is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where beamforming techniques are used for efficient gradient aggregation at the PS.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> digital transmission over a Gaussian MAC from the devices to the PS is considered with quantization based on the channel qualities, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> studies digital transmission using the over-the-air aggregation property of the wireless MAC.
Various device scheduling policies are studied for FEEL aiming to select a subset of the devices sharing the limited wireless resources efficiently, including frequency of participation in the training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, minimizing the training delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, link qualities of the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and importance of the model update along with the channel quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Resource allocation for FEEL is formulated as an optimization problem to speed up training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, to minimize the empirical loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and to minimize the total energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Also, convergence of FEEL with limited bandwidth from the devices to the PS is analyzed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">All the aforementioned works assume an error-free PS-to-devices shared link, and availability of an accurate global model at the devices for local training.
In this paper, we consider a bandwidth-limited wireless fading broadcast channel from the PS to the devices with limited transmit power at the PS.
We introduce <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">digital</span> and <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">analog</span> transmission approaches over the downlink.
In the digital downlink, the PS employs quantization followed by channel coding to broadcast the quantized global model update over the wireless fading broadcast channel, at a rate targeting the device with the worst channel, so that all the devices can successfully receive the global model.
On the other hand, with the analog downlink approach, the PS broadcasts the global model vector in an analog/uncoded manner over the wireless fading broadcast channel, and the devices receive different noisy versions of it.
We model the uplink from the devices to the PS, over which the devices send their model updates, as a bandwidth-limited fading MAC.
We follow the existing works highlighting the efficiency of the analog transmission over the uplink fading MAC for FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and consider analog communications.
The convergence analysis of the proposed digital downlink approach is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Here, we provide the convergence analysis of the analog downlink approach, where for ease of analysis we assume error-free uplink transmission and focus on the impact of a noisy downlink transmission on the convergence behavior.
Our theoretical analysis is complemented with numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset, which clearly illustrate the significant advantages of the analog downlink approach compared to its digital counterpart.
We observe that the improvement is more significant when the data is not independent and identically distributed (iid) across the devices.
The performance of both approaches improve with the number of devices thanks to the additional power introduced by each device.
Our numerical results corroborate the analytical convergence analysis, showing that reducing the number of local iterations provides the best performance when introducing bias in the data distribution across the devices.
Also, both analytical and experimental results show that, for non-iid data distribution, the number of local iterations at the devices should reduce when the transmit power at the PS increases.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Imperfect downlink transmission in FL is also treated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the shared link from the PS to the devices is assumed to be rate-limited without taking into account the physical layer characteristics of the wireless medium;
the PS sends a compressed version of the current global model to the devices through quantization.
The efficiency of quantizing the global model diminishes significantly since the peak-to-average ratio of the parameters is high.
Therefore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposes employing a linear projection at the PS to first spread the information of the global model vector more evenly across its dimensions, and the devices perform the inverse of the linear projection to estimate the global model vector.
Instead, in our proposed digital downlink approach, the PS broadcasts the quantized global model update, with respect to the global model estimate at the devices, and the devices recover an estimate of the current global model using their knowledge of the last global model.
We highlight that the global model update has significantly less variability/variance than the global model itself.
Hence, compared to the proposed digital downlink approach, the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> requires significantly higher computation overhead at the PS and the devices due to the linear projection and its inverse, respectively, and this overhead grows with the number of model parameters.
Moreover, the results in both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> are limited to simulations, where <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> illustrates the advantages of analog transmission in the downlink but does not provide a convergence result.
In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of a noisy downlink on the performance of FEEL through extensive experimental results together with theoretical convergence analysis.</p>

<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the impact of noisy downlink transmission on the performance of FEEL. For this purpose, we consider digital and analog transmission approaches over the downlink channel.
When performing digital transmission, we assume that the PS has CSI about the downlink wireless channels, while for the analog transmission, no CSI about the downlink channels at the PS is needed.
On the other hand, following the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which have shown the superiority of analog transmission for the uplink transmission over a wireless MAC, here we only consider analog transmission over the uplink.</p>

For simplicity of the convergence analysis, we assume that the device-to-PS transmission is error-free, and focus on the impact of noisy downlink transmission on the convergence performance.
We first present the preliminaries and assumptions, and then the convergence result for the analog downlink approach, whose proof is provided in the Appendix.

Despite the significantly lower transmit power at the PS, we observe that the analog downlink scheme remarkably outperforms the digital one for both iid and non-iid scenarios with a notably larger gap between the two for the non-iid case.
It can also be seen that the accuracy of the analog downlink approach is more stable than its digital counterpart, and the degradation in the performance of the analog approach due to the introduced bias in the non-iid data distribution is marginal.
This shows that the analog approach is fairly robust against the heterogeneity of data distribution across devices.
We highlight that with the analog downlink approach the destructive effect of the devices with relatively bad channel conditions, and consequently with a noisier/less accurate estimate of the global model, is alleviated with the devices with good channel conditions, since devices receive different estimates of the global model vector transmitted by the PS depending on their channel conditions.
On the other hand, with the digital downlink approach the common rate at which the global model vector is delivered to the devices should be adjusted such that all the devices, including those with relatively bad channel conditions, can decode it.
This limits the capacity of the devices with good channel conditions, and provides the same copy of the global model estimate to all the devices whose rate is adjusted to accommodate even the worst device.
Another reason for the inferiority of the digital downlink approach is that it requires digitization/quantization of the model parameter vector to a limited number of bits, which provides a less accurate estimate of the global model vector to rely on for local training at the devices than the noisy estimate received from the analog downlink transmission. This is due to the limited capacity of the wireless broadcast channel.</p>

<p id="S6.p6.8" class="ltx_p">The performance of both digital and analog downlink approaches improve with <math id="S6.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p6.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> for both iid and non-iid scenarios.
This is mainly due to the uplink transmission. With more devices, each with its own power budget, analog transmission over the MAC is more robust against the noise, which is due to the additive nature of the MAC.
However, the accuracy of the digital downlink approach is unstable in both iid and non-iid cases.
This is due to the inaccurate model parameter vector estimate at the devices for the digital downlink approach, which leads to a more skewed/less similar local updates at the devices compared to the case of having the actual model parameter vector at the devices.
This deficiency can be clearly seen for <math id="S6.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M=20" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p6.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">20</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.p6.2.m2.1.1.3">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p6.2.m2.1c">M=20</annotation></semantics></math> in the iid scenario. By relying on the local updates from fewer devices, the chance of having more similar local updates (local updates with relatively small Euclidean distance) decreases, and it is less likely that the resultant vector recovered from the output of the MAC provides a good estimate of the gradient of the actual model parameter vector.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have studied FEEL, where the PS with a limited power budget transmits the model parameter vector to the wireless devices over a bandwidth-limited fading broadcast channel.
We have proposed digital and analog transmission approaches for the PS-to-devices transmission.
With the digital approach, the PS quantizes the global model update, with respect to the global model estimate at the devices, with the knowledge of the highest common rate sustainable over the downlink broadcast channel.
For the analysis, we have utilized a capacity achieving channel code to broadcast the same estimate of the global model update to all the devices.
On the other hand, with the analog approach, the PS broadcasts the global model vector in an uncoded manner without employing any channel code, and the devices receive different estimates of the global model through independent wireless connections.
In both approaches, the devices perform multiple local SGD iterations with respect to their global model estimates utilizing their local datasets.
The power-limited wireless devices then transmit their local model updates to the PS over a bandwidth-limited fading MAC in an analog fashion, whose superiority over digital transmission for the uplink has been shown in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
We have also provided a convergence analysis for the analog downlink approach to study the impact of imperfect downlink transmission, leading to noisy estimates of the global model at the devices, on the performance of FL, where for the ease of analysis we have assumed that the uplink transmission is error-free.
Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset have shown a significant improvement of the analog downlink approach over its digital counterpart, where the improvement is more pronounced for the non-iid data scenario.
The analog downlink approach benefits from providing the devices with different estimates of the global model with the quality of these estimates depending on their downlink channel conditions, in which case the destructive effect of the devices with relatively worse channel conditions, and consequently less accurate estimates, can be alleviated by the devices with better channel conditions.
However, with the digital downlink approach, the devices receive the same estimate of the model parameter vector with a common rate limited by the capacity of the worst device.
Therefore, it is likely that all the devices perform local SGD iterations using an inaccurate estimate of the global model.
Both the experimental and analytical results have shown that a smaller number of local SGD iterations should be performed to obtain the best performance of the analog downlink approach for non-iid data compared to iid data.
Also, for non-iid data, by increasing the transmit power at the PS, which leads to a more accurate global model estimate at the devices, a smaller number of local SGD iterations should be performed at the devices.
