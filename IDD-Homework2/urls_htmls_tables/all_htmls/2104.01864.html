<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">The amount of data, manpower and capital required to understand, evaluate and agree on a group of symptoms for the elementary prognosis of pandemic diseases is enormous. In this paper, we present FedPandemic, a novel noise implementation algorithm integrated with cross-device Federated learning for Elementary symptom prognosis during a pandemic, taking COVID-19 as a case study. Our results display consistency and enhance robustness in recovering the common symptoms displayed by the disease, paving a faster and cheaper path towards symptom retrieval while also preserving the privacy of patients’ symptoms via Federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Symptom prognosis and analysis are important tools of pandemic management, as medical conditions of the population could be gauged with these tools. However, appropriate symptoms and their exact effects were reported after mass collection and analysis during COVID-19 (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ghosh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bennett &amp; Carney (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>). This not only consumed time but also required an immense amount of manual effort to anonymize the continuously-growing large corpus of client data. In this paper, we propose <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedPandemic</span>, a novel approach towards the elementary prognosis of diseases during a pandemic by cross-device Federated learning. We present a novel tool towards prominent symptom detection while retaining client privacy during an outbreak. This encourages collaborative efforts between the general public, smaller healthcare clinics/facilities, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), hospitals and large network medical institutions. Federated learning (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>) enables one to send models to where the data resides, rather than sending the data to the cloud thereby respecting the privacy of the users. Federated learning empowers distributed learning by gaining generalized insights over the active client space on decentralized data over a large number of rounds. <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedPandemic</span> employs Word Embeddings as feature extractors for a binary classification model, which is trained using the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) Algorithm (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>). The classifier is aimed to contribute towards preliminary medical examinations and prominent symptoms retrieval in the early stages of an outbreak. The model is developed in a mutable fashion to allow implementations of Secure Aggregation (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>) or Differential Privacy (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wei et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>) for additional privacy use-cases.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedPandemic</span> is trained based on the statistics of symptoms as reported by Statista’s collection of COVID-19 symptoms in Kenya (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Faria (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>), Germany (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Koptyug (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>), Italy (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Stewart (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>), United States (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Elflein (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>) and China (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thomala (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>). The model employs and simulates different target clients with variable data sizes for learning. The implementation requires low computational prowess while still retaining high performance and client privacy making <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedPandemic</span> a potentially strong tool towards future symptom detection during an outbreak.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We summarize five major problems presented in current symptom prognosis tools: (1) Time Consumption in centralized aggregation by a single institution. (2) Data Security of clients participating in such statistics. (3) Manual and Logistic Costs for data anonymization of COVID-19 data to protect client privacy. (4) Logistic, Manual and Infrastructural costs for over heading such a project. (5) Local Bias induced by smaller aggregators and analyzers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Prominent symptom detection is an integral part of pandemic management and control. If these symptoms are detected and retrieved at the earliest, the process of elementary prognosis will be facilitated faster. This may allow different governments to prevent the spread of such diseases. However, current technologies, require a large network of people maintaining and analyzing this data, which is quite expensive. With <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedPandemic</span>, we hope to overcome this problem using Federated learning to provide client privacy and low-cost maintenance based learning.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Proposed Methodology</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We employ Federated learning in a Cross-Device system, as this enables general public to contribute individually. The Federated Averaging algorithm (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>) is used for generalizing the aggregated model. We utilize word embeddings for feature extraction on local devices which allows us to use State-Of-The-Art and
also computationally resourceful encoders such as GloVe (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pennington et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>) and Word2Vec embeddings. Word Embeddings produce a vector of fixed length as extracted features. This output is then fed into a client model, which is trained for a number of epochs <math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">E</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐸</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">E</annotation></semantics></math> and then the weights of the updated model <math id="S2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w^{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.2.m2.1a"><msup id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">w</mi><mi id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑤</ci><ci id="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.2.m2.1c">w^{i}</annotation></semantics></math> are returned to a centralised server. In this paper, we run multiple simulations on different contributors using GloVe (refer Table <a href="#A1.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ A.1 Noise Implementation ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ FedPandemic: A Cross-Device Federated Learning Approach Towards Elementary Prognosis of Diseases During a Pandemic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A common word encoder is decided for implementation and a lightweight classifier is designed keeping in mind the embedder selected. This allows us to develop a model, while at the same time keeping computational costs low. The selected embedder (here, GloVe) and model architecture are declared for training and aggregation. However, only training on client symptoms would make the classifier biased. Hence, we randomly sample symptoms from a given medical corpus, which are then learnt as negative samples by the models (refer Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Proposed Methodology ‣ FedPandemic: A Cross-Device Federated Learning Approach Towards Elementary Prognosis of Diseases During a Pandemic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed methodology allows us to keep a pseudo data balance, thereby making our models robust to bias and underfitting. We believe that we propose the first implementation for symptom aggregation on a large-scale application that entertains both client-privacy as well as distributed learning. The procedure allows us to overcome some important issues of symptom analysis: (1) Manual aggregation of data from multiple healthcare centres is not required. (2) Common Symptoms that would be easily identified by the public, such as, high temperatures, fevers, cough and cold, would also be treated with prominence, giving the general public a better chance of discerning the infected. (3) Retains client privacy; evading efforts required for data anonymization. (4) Word Embeddings also allow semantically similar symptoms to be treated with prominence. This may aid researchers to study additional symptoms that the affected might be exhibiting.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiments were conducted on a single system, running multiple instances of client models. The system consisted of 8GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 1650, 4GB GPU. We leverage the PyTorch framework for our experiments and the base algorithm used for Federated Learning was FedAvg (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>). The classifier used in our experiments consisted of (50, 32, 16, 8, 1) neurons from the top layer to the bottom layer. For our experiments, the learning rate and batch size were chosen as 0.001 and 32 respectively along with the Adam optimizer. Our approach involved
four simulations represented by different aggregation steps, which can be employed by local authorities. Our presentation takes statistical numbers from data; as published on Statista. We choose GloVe (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pennington et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>) as our encoder in our experiments because its embeddings are light-weight and easy-to-use in a Federated learning environment when compared to embeddings from other State-of-the-art encoders like BERT (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin et al.

<p id="A1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present multiple simulations with different levels of noise simulated. In our experiments, we introduce five different noise levels (We include 10% and 90% readings as shown in Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:fig:noisevspred</span> to display results with extreme noise levels) :</p>

The experiment can be thought of as a setting where only individuals infected with the novel coronavirus or the pandemic in consideration. There is little to no influence of any other symptoms the clients may have been facing during learning.</p>
</div>

<li id="A1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

Here the noise levels are increased by 25%. That is, an individual may report symptoms other than that from the disease in consideration with a 25% probability. This setting is closer to reality, as the general public would not know whether the symptoms they feel are relevant to the pandemic or not.</p>

That is, an individual may report symptoms other than that from the disease in consideration with a 50% probability. A step closer to reality and probably the closest, as most citizens are still healthy or if suffering would recognize new symptoms easily. However, noise would still be generated due to the large sample space.</p>

In this case the citizens have a higher chance of entering symptoms that are not related to the pandemic in question, however, due to the frequency presented in the total population, insignificant/not associated symptoms would be lost.</p>

Using 90% noise level, we show that this is entirely based on the frequency analysis shown during a pandemic. The only reason our federated model is expected to converge and learn in such a case, is the sheer frequency of pandemic victims. Therefore, we specifically target our project towards pandemics like novel coronavirus.</p>
