<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">Lyrics play a crucial role in affecting and reinforcing emotional states by providing meaning and emotional connotations that interact with the acoustic properties of the music. Specific lyrical themes and emotions may intensify existing negative states in listeners and may lead to undesirable outcomes, especially in listeners with mood disorders such as depression. Hence, it is important for such individuals to be mindful of their listening strategies. In this study, we examine online music consumption of individuals at risk of depression in light of lyrical themes and emotions. Lyrics obtained from the listening histories of 541 Last.fm users, divided into At-Risk and No-Risk based on their mental well-being scores, were analyzed using natural language processing techniques. Statistical analyses of the results revealed that individuals at risk for depression prefer songs with lyrics associated with low valence and low arousal. Additionally, lyrics associated with themes of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id1.id1.1">denial, self-reference</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id1.id1.2">blame</span> were preferred. This study opens up the possibility of an approach to assessing depression risk from the digital footprint of individuals and potentially developing personalized recommendation systems.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in young adults globally, according to the World Health Organization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. It has the potential to hinder and curb development in personal and social avenues of life, making it a debilitating condition. This underscores the imperative to identify and address it in the early stages.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Music plays an important role in regulating mood and emotions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>. Musical preferences and music listening habits are known to invoke and reinforce moods and emotions and satisfy psychological needs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>. Emotionally vulnerable young adults were found to have more intense relationships with music<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite>. An increased emotional reliance on music was also observed in such individuals<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. However, certain music engagement behaviors and strategies are associated with indicators of poor mental health and do not always lead to the alleviation of existing depressive symptoms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>. Individuals who are depressed or at risk of depression are often unconscious of using music as a tool to improve emotional states <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>, which might lead to adverse outcomes. This highlights the importance of addressing and studying music listening behaviors of individuals prone to depression risk for developing intervention methods to come up with listening strategies that may lead to positive outcomes.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Background and Related Work</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">We highlight previous studies that used online music listening histories from Last.fm and preferences to identify different trends and characteristics in music listening behaviors of individuals at risk of depression. Surana et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite> was the first such study, which used user-annotated tags from Last.fm, to identify emotion- and genre-tag preferences of individuals at risk of depression. The results of this study revealed that At-Risk individuals consume music that is tagged with emotions representing sadness, such as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p1.1.1">sad, depressed, dead, low</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p1.1.2">miserable</span>, and belonging to genres such as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p1.1.3">neo-psychedelic, dream-pop</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p1.1.4">indiepop</span>. In a later study, Surana et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> studied emotions in relation to acoustic features of music as dynamic measures across the span of six months by dividing the listening history into sessions based on periods of inactivity to observe any dynamic patterns in music listening behaviors of At-Risk individuals. This study found that individuals at risk of depression rely more heavily on music and tend to listen to the same songs repeatedly. It was also found that they tend to listen to sad music for longer periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">Shriram et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite> were the first to study lyrics in this context in terms of lyrical repetitiveness and compressibility. The results revealed that At-Risk individuals prefer music with lower lyrical simplicity (lower compressibility) and greater information content, especially for music that is characterized as sad.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p3.1">However, no study to date has explored the link between lyrical emotions and themes extracted from online listening histories and depression risk, to the best of our knowledge.
This link is crucial to investigate because lyrics reinforce negative states and, in dire situations, lead to maladaptive outcomes.
The only study that has looked into lyrical themes associated with maladaptive listening strategies, which is known to be a proxy for depression risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>, was done by Singh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>. They explored the link between lyrical themes extracted using DICTION<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote4"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>www.dictionsoftware.com</span></span></span> and unhealthy music engagement strategies characterized by the Unhealthy-Healthy music scale (HUMS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>, which indirectly indicates depression risk. This study revealed that individuals who engage in unhealthy and maladaptive listening strategies listen to music with lyrical themes representing <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p3.1.1">self-reference</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p3.1.2">blame</span>. However, this has been done in the context of online discourse surrounding depression on Reddit. This raises the question of whether similar behavior can be observed in the lyrical content derived from the listening histories of individuals at risk on music streaming platforms. In this study, we investigated the relationship between individuals’ online listening histories and their risk of depression in the context of lyrical emotions and themes.</p>

DICTION operates through the use of dictionaries that contain lists of words associated with specific linguistic, emotional and cognitive contexts. There are 5 themes and 35 sub-themes in total. We chose the themes <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1">Self-reference, Blame, Optimism, Hardship, Satisfaction, Inspiration, Exclusion</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2">Denial</span>. The frequency scores corresponding to all the themes and sub-themes for each song were obtained, based on the occurrence of the words from the lyrics in the dictionary lists. Similar to the quadrant prevalence scores, mean frequency scores (MFS) were computed for all the themes per user, as shown in Equation <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#S3.E2" title="In 3.2.2 Lyrics-Semantic Themes Mapping ‣ 3.2 Lyrics Processing ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Lyrically Speaking: Exploring the Link Between Lyrical Emotions, Themes and Depression Risk"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Discussion</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">This study is the first of its kind to explore the association between risk for depression and the emotional and thematic connotations of the lyrical content of the music individuals engage with online, as opposed to studies in lab settings or self-reported data. Our results are in concordance with our initial hypotheses, in addition to revealing novel findings.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1">The At-Risk group exhibited a higher median score for Q3 (low valence, low arousal) than the No-Risk group. This finding suggests a greater prevalence of sadness-related lyrical content in the music listened to by the At-Risk group. The stronger association of the At-Risk group with sadness aligns with the results of past research studies on the topic. These results suggest that At-Risk individuals tend to consume music with lyrics that reflect their negative emotional states.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p3.1">As hypothesized, the themes <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.1">self-reference</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.2">blame</span> were more prevalent in the At-Risk group. Additionally, the themes <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.3">denial</span> was also shown to be preferred by At-Risk individuals. Since the themes of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.4">blame</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.p3.1.5">self-reference</span> in lyrics were found to be associated with unhealthy listening strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>, listening to music associated with these themes would not be beneficial to individuals at risk of depression, and in some cases may lead to negative outcomes. This highlights the importance of mindful consumption strategies for music for people at risk of depression.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p4.1">In conclusion, our results show that certain music engagement strategies are maladaptive in nature and should be avoided to prevent the worsening of mood, building on top of previous studies in the area. These results can potentially aid in developing intervention strategies based on lyrical content that should be avoided for better outcomes from music listening.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.1 </span>Limitations</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.p1.1">A limitation of this study is the exclusive focus on lyrical emotions and themes. The interaction of these with the acoustic properties of music and lyrical complexity, as well as in the context of depression risk, could be explored, which could possibly yield a better understanding. The interaction between lyrical themes and emotional connotations is also something that is yet to be studied. Another limitation is that this study exclusively focuses on music with English lyrics. We have also used a predetermined set of themes offered by DICTION, which may not be enough to capture several lyrical themes. An approach to solve this would be to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate themes from a repository of songs and then using them for the scoring.</p>

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="S5.SS2">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.2 </span>Future Work</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p1.1">The results from this paper can be used in building music recommendation systems for depressed individuals that tailor the recommendations, keeping in mind the emotions and themes that are associated with mood worsening and maladaptive behaviors to maximize the positive outcomes through music listening. These results could be combined with other measures associated with such behaviors. This work also opens up the possibility of early depression risk prediction from online music listening behaviors, in terms of lyrics, by cementing lyrical emotions and themes as indicators for depression risk. These measures, in addition to acoustic features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> and other indicators such as lyrical complexity and social tags <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15575v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>, could potentially be used to develop a multi-modal depression risk prediction system.</p>
