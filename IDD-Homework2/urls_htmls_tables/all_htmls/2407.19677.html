<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Privacy is a hot topic for policymakers across the globe, including the United States. Evolving advances in AI and emerging concerns about the misuse of personal data have pushed policymakers to draft legislation on trustworthy AI and privacy protection for its citizens. This paper presents the state of the privacy legislation at the U.S. Congress and outlines how voice data is considered as part of the legislation definition. This paper also reviews additional privacy protection for children. This paper presents a holistic review of enacted and proposed privacy laws, and consideration for voice data, including guidelines for processing children's data, in those laws across the fifty U.S. states. As a groundbreaking alternative to actual human data, ethically generated synthetic data allows much flexibility to keep AI innovation in progress. Given the consideration of synthetic data in AI legislation by policymakers to be relatively new, as compared to that of privacy laws, this paper reviews regulatory considerations for synthetic data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human voice or speech contains very personal information about a speaker and therefore, it is important to safeguard voice or audio recordings of a speaker from misuse. Guidelines on the collection, storage, and use of any individual's personal data, as collected by any business (such as a company, operator, or service provider), need to comply with the privacy policies as set forward by the local, state, and federal agencies and government. Given numerous recent instances of violation of consumer privacy as well as rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology which is now available to scammers, lawmakers across U.S. and the world have placed the topic of data privacy on the center stage. Countries and diplomatic organizations across the globe are drafting and implementing AI governance legislation and policies. The thrust for legislation on AI in the United States (U.S.) has been both from the executive branch i.e. the office of the U.S. President or the White House, and the legislative branch i.e. U.S. Congress - collectively by the Senate and the House. Privacy has been a key focus for lawmakers in drafting AI legislation. However, many policymakers agree that the legislation on AI and data privacy would be interlinked.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Blueprint for the AI Bill of Rights</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> with outlining principles and good practices to design, use, and deploy AI systems for protecting civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy of the citizens. This was followed by the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> by the President in 2023. This extensive executive order covered safety and security of AI technology, promotion of innovation and competition, support for workforce, protection of rights and privacy, including actions for several federal agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST.
On May 15, 2024, a <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Policy in the United States Senate</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> was released by the Bipartisan Senate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Working Group. This roadmap highlights various policy priorities including funding for AI innovation, enforcement of existing laws for AI, impact of AI on workforce, enhancing national security, addressing challenges posed by deepfakes, and support for higher education research and development on AI. This roadmap also prioritizes policies on establishing a strong comprehensive federal data privacy framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by many recent U.S. legislation on privacy protection, this paper aims to give an overview and current state of both the federal and state privacy policies across the U.S. A holistic review of these privacy legislation also highlights how voice fits in the legislative definition. Children's data being sensitive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, a review of protection for children's privacy legislation is also presented in this paper. As compared to privacy laws, AI legislation is new, and many U.S. states are considering additional AI legislation on top of the privacy laws. Some of these AI legislation also consider defining synthetic data and voice generation.

As the lawmakers mentioned, this proposed legislation is ``bipartisan'' (support from lawmakers from both political parties) and ``bicameral" (support from lawmakers from both chambers of the U.S. Congress). The primary goal of APRA is to establish a nationwide comprehensive data privacy and security standard for all U.S. citizens including children. APRA includes several actions such as (1) guidelines on prohibitions on consumer personal data use, including sensitive and biometric data of consumers, (2) consumer rights, including access, correction, and deletion, on covered data (covered data is any data which identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual), (3) policies for design by privacy and transparency, (4) opt-out privilege of consumers, and (5) enforcement of internal data security and privacy guardrails by businesses.</p>

This also includes additional obligations for high-impact social media companies, data holders, and data brokers. After its original draft was released in April, APRA has been discussed and edited twice with an expected markup (lawmakers offer and vote on amendments) scheduled for June 27, 2024, by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. However, there are still multiple concerns with this legislation.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">APRA considers ``<span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">voice prints</span>'' as biometric information, which is defined as any data that could directly or indirectly help to identify an individual and that could be generated through unique characteristics of an individual like biological, physical, or physiological. Biometric information is considered as ``sensitive covered data''. There are guidelines regarding the collection, processing, retention, or transfer of biometric information, and the need for consent from consumers. An ``<span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">audio recording</span>" or any data derived from such a recording is <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">excluded</span> from the definition of biometric information unless it could be used to identify an individual.

This particular legislation has gained significant momentum since Feb 2024, both at the U.S. Senate and House. It has also been discussed in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce along with other bills such as KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act). COPPA 2.0 would also extend protection to teens between 12 to 17 years in age. Several updates have been proposed in the new COPPA 2.0 legislation, including extension of the definition of personal information, website/online service providers, consent, data retention, advertising, and use for educational technology.</p>

The action on state privacy bills was followed by other states such as: Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and many more. 19 U.S. states have already enacted new privacy legislation. Legislation on privacy has been proposed and is in progress in 13 states, while the action has already failed in 2 states. To date, no privacy bill has been proposed in the remaining 16 U.S. states.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Utah <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is the first U.S. state to enact a comprehensive AI governance law that went into effect on May 1, 2024. Similar to its privacy law <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, ``<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">voice</span>'' is defined in the AI legislative text. In this legislation, ``synthetic data'' is defined as ``<span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data that has been generated by computer algorithms or statistical models and does not contain personal data</span>'', therefore considering synthetic data as de-identified data. The AI legislation in Utah is followed by Colorado <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which will be effective on February 1, 2026. This legislation majorly focuses on the risks of AI systems related to discrimination, including many other arguments. ``<span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Voice</span>'' or ``<span id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">synthetic data</span>'' is not defined in the legislation, but this legislation does not consider conversational AI technology a high risk unless it generates content that is discriminatory or harmful. AI legislation has passed in only these two U.S. states, and in progress in several states: California, Illinois, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Oklahoma.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed California AI Transparency Act <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> would require any person that creates, codes, or otherwise produces a generative AI system, which is publicly available and has over 1,000,000 monthly visitors, to include a latent disclosure (permanent, to the extent it is technically feasible) in AI-generated digital content (synthetic data) including ``audio''. Illinois <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> Consumer Fraud-AI legislation proposes for requirement of disclosure on synthetic media in advertising. However, the definition also includes ``human voice'' <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">created, reproduced, or modified by generative AI or a software algorithm to produce or reproduce a human voice</span>. Similar to Illinois, the AI legislation in New York <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> requires advertisements to disclose the use of a synthetic performer (synthetic data), but does not explicitly mention ``voice''.
Louisiana's proposed AI bill <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> primarily revolves around guidelines for AI foundation models, requiring every publicly available (made available by any person in the state) foundation model and its use to be officially registered with the state, and await for further guidelines from the state. ``Audio'' is explicitly defined as one of the ``AI-generated content'' (synthetic data) either created or modified by a ``generative artificial intelligence system'' in the proposed AI legislation for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. A mandatory disclosure is required for all generative AI systems, otherwise punishable, with notice and metadata information of the AI-generated content. Any person using such a Generative-AI system to generate or re-purpose AI-generated content would also be prohibited from removing the disclosure information. The proposed AI legislation in Ohio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> provides guidelines on AI-generated (or synthetic) products and the prohibition of identity fraud using a replica of a person. ``Replica of a person's persona'' (or replica) is defined as a customized version of an individual's ``voice'' (and other factors), that appears to be the individual's authentic persona. The replica could be partially or fully generated by AI. The proposed AI legislation in Oklahoma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> gives its citizens the right to consent to any ``<span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">derivative media that is generated by an artificial intelligence engine and uses audio recordings of the citizen's voice or images of him or her to recreate the citizen's likeness</span>''.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Innovation in AI is necessary, but not at the cost of privacy. The speech technology community has led several efforts on voice privacy including The Voice Privacy Challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and Symposium on Security and Privacy in Speech Communication. It is important to communicate such efforts on voice privacy to the public and policymakers. Businesses have an obligation to disseminate whether they follow privacy-preserving technology development, and also how they collect, use, and maintain consumer data. Such actions would be valuable for speech technology research and development to sustain, as the world navigates regulations on privacy and trustworthy AI. On the legislative actions, momentum on both privacy and AI bills is rapid. Apart from many regulations, California and Illinois have proposed Consumer Privacy Funds to educate the public, including children in the area of online privacy. In the future, it would be interesting to navigate and compare how the legislative landscape in the U.S. differs from other countries across the globe such as the GDPR and the EU AI Act.</p>
