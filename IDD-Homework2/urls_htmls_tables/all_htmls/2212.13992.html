<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of end users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging gradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the differential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to address privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model performance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and efficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users.
Specifically, we propose SCFL, a novel <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>ocial-aware <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">C</span>lustered <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social cluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each cluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model updates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer combined results, but not the privacy of individuals. As such, SCFL considerably enhances model utility without sacrificing privacy in a low-cost and highly feasible manner. We unfold the design of SCFL in three steps. <em id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i) Stable social cluster formation</em>. Considering users' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the optimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair revenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. <em id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ii) Differentiated trust-privacy mapping</em>. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a customizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize participants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. <em id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">iii) Distributed convergence</em>. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain an optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence. Experiments on Facebook network and MNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets validate that our SCFL can effectively enhance learning utility, improve user payoff, and enforce customizable privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the explosive growth of smart phones, wearables, and Internet of things (IoT) devices, nearly 75% of data is anticipated to be produced, gathered, and processed outside of clouds by 2025, particularly at distributed end-devices at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Due to data privacy and ownership rights, aggregating such huge volumes of distributed data into a central cloud for artificial intelligence (AI) model training can be both illegally and privacy risky <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising privacy-preserving AI paradigm with the idea of bringing code to data instead of the opposite direction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In FL, individual devices periodically train the AI sub-models (e.g., gradients) using local data and send to the aggregation server (e.g., the cloud) which synthesizes a global AI model for next-round training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. As users only share the learned model parameters instead of the original raw data, the privacy concerns can be significantly resolved under FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in such an open and untrusted FL environment, users' privacy can still be divulged from their trained sub-models (e.g., gradients) via attacks such as membership inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and model inversion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> launched by smart adversaries and the untrusted server. For example, experiments in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> validate that clients' private training data can be stolen from the publicly shared gradients in vision and language tasks.
Existing countermeasures mainly rely on the local differential privacy (LDP) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> due to the strict theoretic guarantee and low computation overhead, in which individuals independently sanitize their sub-models by adding random LDP perturbations, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In LDP-based approaches, the larger injected LDP noise enforces stronger privacy provisions but also entails more severe performance degradation, which eventually deteriorates individual payoff. Thereby, LDP-based FL approaches usually require a tradeoff between privacy and utility.
Current efforts mainly focus on designing optimized FL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to strive for such a balance, while ignoring the inner and lasting connections between users, such as social relationships.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the great success of social networks, social ties have been widely established among mobile users.
For instance, 2.93 billion social users monthly interacted via Facebook in the first quarter of 2022, with an average of roughly 200 friends per user <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Benefiting from large-scale social networks, individuals can easily invite their trusted and familiar social friends as cooperative learners and form socially clustered federations (or clusters), as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Within each social cluster, members' trained sub-models can be aggregated into a combined one before uploading to the cloud.
Essentially, as individuals inside each social cluster are mutually trusted, they no longer need to apply LDP perturbations to the trained sub-models, which considerably enhances model utility (e.g., model accuracy) and individual payoff.
Meanwhile, both external adversaries and the curious cloud cannot deduce the gradient information of each participating user from the intra-cluster intermediate model aggregations, thereby well protecting user privacy.
As such, the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">s</span>ocial-aware <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>lustered <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">f</span>ederated <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">l</span>earning (SCFL) paradigm offers a promising countermeasure to enhance model utility while enforcing privacy protection in FL with low cost and high feasibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To practically deploy SCFL services, a series of fundamental challenges still need to be resolved.
1) As users are generally selfish and profit-seeking, they can determine whether or not to join a social cluster, as well as which social cluster to join depending on the payoffs and social ties. Thereby, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">it remains a concern to distributively form a stable and optimized social cluster structure</em>.
2) Heterogeneous users typically have distinct quality, amount, and non-IID degree of training data samples in undertaking different FL tasks, resulting in distinct model quality and contributions. Besides, selfish individuals often tend to benefit from the SCFL without making any effort to the social cluster, and such free-riding behaviors may lead to poor learning outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">There exists a challenge in contribution quantification and fair revenue allocation within each social cluster with free-rider defense</em>.
3) In some clusters with low mutual social trust, learners may still need to add modest amount of LDP perturbations for privacy concerns. Due to the diversity of users' social ties and privacy preferences, <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how to design a flexible and differentiated perturbation mechanism to attain a tradeoff between privacy and utility is a challenging issue</em>.</p>

Specifically, we model the interactions among socially connected learners as a distributed federation game with transferable utility (FTU), and formally define the federal payoff and cost of social clusters.
Considering heterogenous training samples, data quality, and non-IID degrees of users, we then devise a fair revenue allocation mechanism among all members in each social cluster based on their quantified contributions.
Next, for users joining clusters with relatively low trust, a customizable privacy preservation mechanism is designed to meet users' privacy expectations by adaptively determining the privacy protection level depending on both trust-related factors and structural information of the social network.
Furthermore, we design an iterative two-sided matching algorithm to derive the Nash-stable social clustering structure, where each individual determines the transfer strategy to merge with the optimal cluster while each social cluster determines the optimal admission strategy to accept the optimal learner.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, many works have studied the impact of differential privacy (DP) noises on model performance, assuming that the aggregation server is semi-honest (i.e., honest-but-curious).

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In the case that a user joins a specific cluster with relatively low mutual social trust, the user may still need to add a modest amount of LDP perturbations for privacy concerns.

Here, we develop a trust-oriented customized local perturbation mechanism to satisfy individual privacy expectations in practice. Particularly, the Gaussian mechanism is adopted by adding artificial noise following the Gaussian distribution <math id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\mathbb{G}}(0,\sigma^{2}S^{2})" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">𝔾</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2.cmml">,</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2.cmml">σ</mi><mn id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msup><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msup id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">S</mi><mn id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">2</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.4" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.2"></times><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.3">𝔾</ci><interval closure="open" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">0</cn><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2">𝜎</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.2.3">2</cn></apply><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2">𝑆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.m1.2c">{\mathbb{G}}(0,\sigma^{2}S^{2})</annotation></semantics></math>.

In the baseline scheme, participants' raw local updates rather than the noised version are exchanged, where the social clustering, non-IID efects, and user privacy preservation are not considered.
As shown in Figs. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-A Experiment Setup ‣ V EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION ‣ Social-Aware Clustered Federated Learning with Customized Privacy Preservation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ V-A Experiment Setup ‣ V EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION ‣ Social-Aware Clustered Federated Learning with Customized Privacy Preservation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, the SCFL outperforms the uniform DP scheme in attaining a smaller accuracy gap with the baseline scheme (i.e., naive FL under IID without DP perturbation) in both MNIST and CIFAR-10. Besides, when the number of participants increases, the model accuracy in SCFL and the baseline scheme decreases, while that in the uniform DP scheme increases. The reason is that in our setting, the total dataset is divided among all participants in an non-IID manner. As such, more participants result in lower local samples of each user, causing an accuracy drop in SCFL and baseline. Moreover, when more participants add the random noise with the same Gaussian distribution, the aggregated effect of LDP noise can be reduced, thereby causing an accuracy rise in the uniform DP scheme.</p>

It is because the partition structure with fixed cluster heads in the social influence based scheme cannot adapt to the heterogeneous users and varying FL environment, leading to a smaller individual payoff. In the non-cooperative scheme, as all users work alone in the FL process, it causes the lowest individual payoff.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Striving a trade-off between privacy and utility plays a fundamental role in the practical deployment of DP-based FL services. Due to the rich manners of connectivity in real-world and motivations to ally for profits, we argue that the participants of FL tend to form social connections. By exploiting such social attributes among users, this paper has proposed a novel, efficient, and practical SCFL framework to realize feasible, high-utility, and customized privacy-preserving FL services.
Firstly, we have designed a contribution quantification and fair allocation mechanism for heterogeneous users in each social cluster. Considering some clusters may have low mutual trust, a customizable privacy preservation mechanism has been devised for adaptive local model update sanitization based on social trust. In addition, we have developed a distributed two-sided matching algorithm to obtain an optimized stable partition in FTU game. Experiment results have validated the effectiveness of SCFL in terms of user payoff, model utility, and privacy preservation, compared with existing solutions.</p>
