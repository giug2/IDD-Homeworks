<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. In particular, we show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes’ gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary’s attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL. Extensive numerical tests further validate that decentralized FL is more resistant to privacy attacks, aligning with our theoretical findings.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple participants/nodes/clients without directly sharing each node’s raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. FL can operate on either a centralized/star topology or a decentralized topology, as shown in <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 1</span></a> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The prevalent centralized topology requires a central server that interacts with each and every node individually.
The main procedure of a centralized FL protocol typically unfolds in three steps: 1) Nodes train local models based on their own private dataset and transmit model updates, such as gradients, to the server; 2) The server aggregates the local models to a global model and redistributes to the nodes; 3) Nodes update the local models based on the global model and send the model updates back to the server. The process is iteratively repeated until convergence.
However, a centralized server is not always feasible due to its high communication demands and the need for universal trust from all nodes. In addition, it poses a risk of a single point of failure, making the network vulnerable to targeted attacks. As an alternative, decentralized FL circumvents these issues by facilitating direct data exchanges between (locally) connected nodes, thereby eliminating the need for a central server for model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Decentralized FL protocols, also known as peer-to-peer learning protocols, fall into two main categories. The first involves average-consensus-based protocols. With these protocols, instead of sending model parameters to a central server, nodes collaborate together to perform model aggregation nodes in a distributed manner. The aggregation is typically done by partially averaging the local updates within a node’s neighborhood. Examples of these protocols are the empirical methods where the aggregation is done using average consensus techniques such as gossiping SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, D-PSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and variations thereof <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The second category comprises protocols that are based on distributed optimization, referred to as optimization-based decentralized FL. These (iterative) methods directly formulate the underlying problem as a constrained optimization problem and employ distributed solvers like ADMM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or PDMM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to solve them. The constraints are formulated in such a way that, upon convergence, the learned models at all nodes are identical. Hence, there is no explicit separation between updating local models and the update of the global model, i.e., the three steps in centralized FL mentioned before are executed simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite not directly sharing private data with servers or nodes, FL is shown vulnerable to privacy attacks as the exchanged information, such as gradients or weights, still poses a risk for privacy leakage.
Existing work on privacy leakage predominantly focuses on the centralized case.
A notable example is the gradient inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, an iterative method for finding input data that produce a gradient similar to the gradient generated by the private data. Such attacks are based on the assumption that similar gradients are produced by similar data samples.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In exploring the privacy aspects of centralized versus decentralized FL, many works claim that the decentralized FL is more privacy-preserving than centralized FL without any privacy argument <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The main idea is that sensitive information, such as private data, model weights, and user states, can no longer be observed or controlled through a single server. However, recent empirical findings challenge such a claim, particularly for average-consensus-based decentralized FL protocols. It is shown in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> that these protocols may not inherently offer better privacy protections over centralized FL, and might even increase susceptibility to privacy breaches. For instance, it has been shown that an arbitrary colluding client could potentially obtain the same amount of information as a central server in centralized FL when inverting input private data via gradients. In contrast, the privacy implications of optimization-based decentralized FL protocols have, to the best of our knowledge, been rarely investigated. This research gap is partly due to the fact that analytically tracking the privacy leakage in distributed algorithms, particularly over multiple iterations, is very challenging. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing and comprehending how information is correlated between these iterations.</p>

For DNN applications, we show that in the case of optimization-based decentralized FL, gradient inversion attacks can be applied to reconstruct the original input data, but the reconstruction performance is degraded compared to centralized FL due to the limited amount of information available to the adversary. A similar trend is also observed when evaluated using membership inference attacks.
Overall, decentralized FL employing distributed optimization is shown to be less vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to centralized FL, consistent with our theoretical findings. This finding challenges the previous belief that decentralized FL offers no privacy advantages compared to centralized FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> (see Section <a href="#S8.SS5" title="VIII-E Related work ‣ VIII Deep neural networks II: privacy gap ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VIII-E</span></span></a> for a detailed explanation).</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider two types of adversary models: the eavesdropping and the passive (also known as honest-but-curious) adversary model. While eavesdropping can typically be addressed through channel encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, it remains a pertinent concern in our context. This relevance stems from the nature of iterative algorithms, where communication channels are utilized repeatedly, continuously encrypting each and every message incurs high communication overhead. Therefore, in our framework, we assume that network communication generally occurs over non-secure channels, except for the initial network setup phase, details of which will be discussed later (see Section <a href="#S4" title="IV DFL using distributed optimizers ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>).
The passive adversary consists of a number of colluding nodes, referred to as corrupt nodes, which comply with the algorithm instructions but utilize the received information to infer the private input data of the other so-called honest nodes. Consequently, the adversary has access to the following information: (a) all information gathered by the corrupt nodes, and (b) all messages transmitted over unsecured (i.e., non-encrypted) channels.</p>

First, we examine a straightforward logistic regression example, where it’s possible to analytically calculate the privacy loss. In this instance, we find no discernible privacy gap. Next, we shift our focus to a more conventional application within FL: DNNs. Through extensive empirical analysis, we observe a notable privacy gap between CFL and DFL. This gap highlights DFL’s reduced susceptibility to privacy attacks when compared to CFL.</p>

Given that both CFL and DFL protocols are iterative processes consisting of numerous iterations, in principle the gradient inversion attack can deploy all iterations’ information for inverting the input samples. To identify the most effective attack strategy for such an attack, we first explore which iteration yields the most effective results for the gradient inversion attack. In <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VII-C Optimum attack strategy ‣ VII Deep neural networks I: Convergence and gradient inversion attacks ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 4</span></a>(a) we demonstrate the attack performance, quantified by the averaged SSIM of all reconstructed samples (illustrated by solid lines) along with their standard derivation (shown as shadows)
of CFL and DFL using gradient differences as a function of iteration number <math id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> using the MNIST dataset. We can see that the SSIM of the centralized case consistently surpasses those in the decentralized case throughout all iterations. Unlike the centralized case where the reconstruction performance remains relatively stable across iterations, the reconstruction performances of the decentralized case degrade significantly in later iterations. This trend aligns with the expectation that gradient differences will approach zero at convergence thereby containing very little information.</p>

<div id="S7.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To visualize this phenomenon, <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VII-C Optimum attack strategy ‣ VII Deep neural networks I: Convergence and gradient inversion attacks ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 4</span></a>(b)
displays illustrative examples of both cases at every 100 iterations. The SSIM results are in agreement with these visual examples; for instance, in the later iterations of the decentralized case, the ground truth digit <math id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="9" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">9</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1">9</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.p4.1.m1.1c">9</annotation></semantics></math> can hardly be recognized. Hence, the effectiveness of gradient inversion attacks is more pronounced in the initial iterations.
As for the case of inverting inputs via the gradient sum, we observe the reconstruction performance
remains relatively stable across iterations as the phenomenon in CFL (see <a href="#A6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ Appendix F Supplementary attack results ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 10</span></a> in Appendix <a href="#A6" title="Appendix F Supplementary attack results ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">F</span></a> in Supplementary). Note that for both CFL and DFL we observe a slightly better performance at the early stage. This might be due to the fact that at early iterations the local models contain more information about the local datasets while at later iterations the models are more fitted to the global dataset. For this reason, for the forthcoming Fig <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VII-C Optimum attack strategy ‣ VII Deep neural networks I: Convergence and gradient inversion attacks ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VII-C Optimum attack strategy ‣ VII Deep neural networks I: Convergence and gradient inversion attacks ‣ Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we will focus on exploiting gradients from early iterations to execute the gradient inversion attacks.</p>

Notable disparities exist in the reconstructed samples of CFL and DFL cases. More specifically, compared to the centralized case, reconstructing inputs via gradient differences is less efficient and yields lower quality. The inefficiency is due to the fact that the adversary needs to iterate through all possible labels to identify the best fit. Furthermore, the quality is compromised due to the inherently reduced information in gradient differences compared to the full gradients.
To evaluate the quality of reconstructed inputs, we chose the best-fit samples among iterated inputs for each batch and computed their averaged SSIM.

We conducted a detailed analysis of the information flow within the network across various iterations, establishing both upper and lower bounds for the information loss. The bounds indicate that privacy leakage in DFL is consistently less than or equal to that in CFL. We further exemplified our results through two standard applications: logistic regression and training a DNN. In the case of simple logistic regression, we observed that the privacy leakage in both CFL and DFL are identical. However, in more complex scenarios like training DNNs, the privacy loss as measured by the gradient inversion attack is markedly higher in CFL than in DFL. As expected, the privacy gap between CFL and DFL is more pronounced in the presence of numerous honest nodes. Extensive experimental results substantiated our findings.</p>
