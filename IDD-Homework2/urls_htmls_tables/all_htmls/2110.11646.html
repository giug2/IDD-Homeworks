<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">For data isolated islands and privacy issues, federated learning has been extensively invoking much interest since it allows clients to collaborate on training a global model using their local data without sharing any with a third party. However, the existing federated learning frameworks always need sophisticated condition configurations (e.g., sophisticated driver configuration of standalone graphics card like NVIDIA, compile environment) that bring much inconvenience for large-scale development and deployment. To facilitate the deployment of federated learning and the implementation of related applications, we innovatively propose WebFed, a novel browser-based federated learning framework that takes advantage of the browser’s features (e.g., Cross-platform, JavaScript Programming Features) and enhances the privacy protection via local differential privacy mechanism. Finally, We conduct experiments on heterogeneous devices to evaluate the performance of the proposed WebFed framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During the past ten years, the breakthrough of machine learning (ML) technology has recently yielded encouraging results due to the development of computing power and big data, showcasing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems able to assist life, education, and work in a variety of scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the conventional training mode encounters the issues, such as privacy leakage of user data and massive data transmission since it needs to gather all the raw training data. Hence, the privacy-preserving issue has attracted more and more attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">House (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, and it has promoted a novel machine learning technology, which is called federated learning (FL). It leaves the personal training data distributed on their local devices and enables the clients to learn a shared global model by aggregating their local training results. It is seemed to be one instance of the more general approach to address the fundamental problems of privacy, ownership, and data isolated islands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of FL has promoted the development of machine learning applications in many fields since it could solve the problem caused by the contradiction between model training and user data privacy, that is, collecting more user data is conducive to the training effect but may lead to user privacy leakage.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the most existing federated learning frameworks require the participants who have the heterogeneous operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android) to install related software and configure complicated learning environment which seriously blocks their applications. Therefore, it is necessary to develop solutions other than standard methods for large-scale machine learning, distributed optimization, and other scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. That’s is why we will try to develop a browser-based federated learning framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As an engine for developing distributed machine learning models and algorithms, the browser has the following advantages:
(1) Browsers with cross-platform features and web programming languages make the software compatibility of machine learning models and algorithms obvious: nearly almost all computing devices can participate in machine learning training by contributing their computing resources to the entire learning process without any other software installation and could, with the same code, utilize the predictive models on the same devices. (2) WebGL and related technologies can make better use of integrated graphics cards to accelerate deep learning (DL) tasks, without the need for complex driver configuration of discrete graphics cards like NVIDIA that requires native DL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ma et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. (3) Browsers have great potential, are inexpensive and large in scale, and can widely bring complex ML learning and prediction to the public <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Meeds et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, even FL has avoided the gathering of user’s data, it still encounters the challenges on the privacy issues that the clients’ information could be leaked by analyzing their uploaded parameters, such as the trained weights in deep neural networks (DNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wei et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models was firstly performed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nasr et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. They designed white-box inference attacks and tested the privacy leakage through the fully trained model’s parameters and the updates during the whole training process. They also investigated the reasons for the information leakage of the deep learning models in the training data. To address the aforementioned information leakage issues, differential privacy (DP) is used as an element formulation of privacy in probabilistic terms to prevent privacy leakage of the information contained in its inputs by adding noise in centralized server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fioretto et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The above study motivates us to develop a browser-based cross-platform FL framework with local differential privacy that is capable of performing large-scale collaborative training on heterogeneous devices and enhances privacy protection by adding artificial noise. To our knowledge, it is the state-of-the-art exploration of developing the privacy-enhanced browser-based FL framework.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">TensorFlow.js is a library developed by Google to build and execute machine learning algorithms in JavaScript, which means the training process could be realized in the browser based on Node.js environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Smilkov et al.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Privacy Issues in Federated Learning </h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning allows training a shared global model with a central server without gathering the clients’ private data. By designing a privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient federated learning system, an application for the prediction of in-hospital mortality was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kerkouche et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Moreover, FFD (Federated learning for Fraud Detection) was proposed to use behavior features distributed on the banks’ local database to train a fraud detection model instead of the traditional fraud detection system that needs centralized data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. In order to realize distributed machine learning with privacy protection, federated learning has shown great potential as it avoids the direct raw data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, it is still possible to leak privacy which is defined as the information an adversary can learn from the model about the users even it does not need to gather their private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fredrikson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>); Hitaj et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. For example, an adversary with BlackBox or Whitebox access to the target model aims to determine whether a given target data point belongs to the private training data of the target model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nasr et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. It’s more effective for membership inference attacks against deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Nasr et al.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy is an element formulation of privacy in probabilistic terms. It can provide a strict preserve for an algorithm to prevent leakage of private information contained in its inputs for the centralized architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fioretto et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Local differential privacy (LDP) allows the clients to perturb their information locally to provide plausible deniability of their information without the necessity of a trusted party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>)</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>)</cite>, the authors exploited novel LDP mechanisms to collect a numeric attribute. In terms of worst-case noise variance, it usually has a better performance on accuracy than existing solutions. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kairouz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, they focus on the fundamental trade-off between local differential privacy and information-theoretic utility functions, because data providers and analysts want to maximize the utility of statistical inferences performed on the released data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>)</cite>, the authors propose to apply LDP to protect the clients’ data by distribution estimation.

Moreover, we also test on convolutional federated learning framework that does not run on the browsers, which is called FL for short in the following. In order to control the experimental variables, we apply local differential privacy to both, and the privacy budget is 3.

And it illustrates that after the same training time, the accuracy of the traditional federated learning framework will be slightly higher than WebFed. We also can find that the curve trend of WebFed is always showing fluctuated than FL, when the training time is about 300 seconds, the difference in accuracy between FL and WebFed is obvious, the gap is about 13%.

Compared with the other two cases, the accuracy gap is about 10%. After 200 epochs of training, when epsilon is equal to 3 and 6, the accuracy is about 87% and 90%, respectively.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, considering the difficulty of the cross-device deployment of federated learning, we proposed WebFed, a browser-based federated learning framework with privacy preservation. By leveraging the advantage of the cross-device characteristics of web browsers, WebFed is more conducive to actual federated learning research and application landing. What’s more, in order to strengthen privacy protection, we apply local differential privacy mechanism to add artificial noise to the local updates before global aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we conduct the experiments on heterogeneous devices (smartphones and PC) to evaluate the performance of WebFed. The experimental results show that our browser-based framework can achieve a training effect close to the conventional framework in terms of model accuracy. We also found that an appropriate privacy budget setting can enhance the privacy protection with only a subtle impact on the training performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, to further simplify deployment and increase the flexibility of federated learning, we plan to integrate the server into the browser. In this way, participants and servers (which could also be regarded as a participant) only need to manually select their roles in the browser and form a group for federated learning, rather than deploying servers separately. Furthermore, we will optimize corresponding mechanisms for clients’ joining and leaving, and conduct more thorough experiments to evaluate the performance of WebFed. Machine learning in the browser is still in its infancy. We will further study the limitations of in-browser training, improve the existing work and then publish WebFed as an open-source framework.</p>
