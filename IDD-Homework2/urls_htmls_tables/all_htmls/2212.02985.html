<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Traditional learning-based approaches to student modeling (e.g., predicting grades based on measured activities) generalize poorly to underrepresented/minority student groups due to biases in data availability.
In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning (MLPFL) methodology which optimizes inference accuracy over different layers of student grouping criteria, such as by course and by demographic subgroups within each course.
In our approach, personalized models for individual student subgroups are derived from a global model, which is trained in a distributed fashion via meta-gradient updates that account for subgroup heterogeneity while preserving modeling commonalities that exist across the full dataset.
To evaluate our methodology, we consider case studies of two popular downstream student modeling tasks, knowledge tracing and outcome prediction, which leverage multiple modalities of student behavior (e.g., visits to lecture videos and participation on forums) in model training.
Experiments on three real-world datasets from online courses demonstrate that our approach obtains substantial improvements over existing student modeling baselines in terms of increasing the average and decreasing the variance of prediction quality across different student subgroups.
Visual analysis of the resulting students’ knowledge state embeddings confirm that our personalization methodology extracts activity patterns which cluster into different student subgroups, consistent with the performance enhancements we obtain over the baselines.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Oline learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has proven to be a critical component of today’s educational platforms, highlighted by its significant uptick in usage during the COVID-19 pandemic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The remote nature of online learning makes it harder for instructors to pay attention to each individual student and provide feedback at a personalized level.
This has motivated the investigation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches to delivering personalized instruction and feedback based on measured student progress in online learning activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

There exist a wide range of student models, from those that analyze (i) student <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">knowledge</em>, such as item response theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and models for knowledge tracing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, to those that analyze (ii) student <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">behavior</em> within computer-based learning platforms, e.g., to detect psychological states <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and discover learning tendencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Since these student models are fitted from student data collected from real-world learning platforms, they are inherently prone to any biases that exist in the available data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
As a result, the research topic of <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">de-biasing</em> data-driven student models has gained recent traction; studies have investigated existing algorithmic biases in educational applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and explored how to impose constraints during model training to promote fairness across different student groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One common theme of these existing de-biasing works is that they study the bias/fairness aspects of a single <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global</em> student model that is trained on <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">all</em> students data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. This setup is typically effective in AI applications since more data generally leads to improved model fit.
However, this setup ignores the fact that <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">underrepresented groups</em> may not be well-captured by a population-level model, resulting in unfair and erroneous predictions that could be catastrophic for some students <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. On the contrary, training separate <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local</em> models for each student subgroup may not be effective since small subgroups do not have enough data for us to train an accurate model.

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The recently proposed federated deep knowledge tracing (FDKT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> method is a first step towards coordinating between global and local student models, based on federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
, a popular technique for enabling collaboration among models trained on heterogeneous local datasets through periodic global model aggregations.
Beyond the conventional FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, research in <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Global FL</span> has proposed various aggregation strategies to optimize the obtained global model, in terms of relevant objectives for different learning settings, e.g.,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
In particular, FedAtt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> adds an attention layer to improve FL in terms of trained model accuracy, while FedAdagrad <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> aim to improve the speed of convergence.
However, statistical heterogeneity across local data distributions – i.e., non-i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data – is an inherent characteristic of most FL applications that presents fundamental challenges to Global FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. This has motivated <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Personalized FL</span> which aims to redefine the relationship between the local and global models for a better match to individual local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
In particular, Personalized FL shifts the optimization focus to individual local objectives, often by incorporating meta-functions into the definition of the global learning objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In student modeling, this statistical heterogeneity property manifests along several dimensions. FDKT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> addresses the heterogeneity arising from student training data being split across different schools.
Applying the FL principle, local models are trained for each school, and updating between the global and local models is coordinated without transferring the data.
While this setup is representative of some real-world educational settings, it ignores the bigger picture of heterogeneity across student subgroups such as race, gender, and other demographic variables.
In particular, researchers in AI fairness have pointed to a pattern of underrepresented/minority groups with fewer data quantities tending to be ignored when training a general model, resulting in biases and ethical issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The aggregation scheme in FDKT weights the local models according to “<em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data quality</em>,” measured through fitting local psychometric models such as classical test theory and item response theory.
This results in an implicit downweighting of underrepresented student subgroups due to a lack of data volume, which is not acceptable in our setting since the data from each group contains important information about how these students learn. We address this in our work by developing a Personalized FL methodology which accounts for heterogeneity across courses and demographics in a multi-tiered student modeling framework.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our student modeling approach will build upon and formalize two key observations from past educational data mining research that can further mitigate biases.
These will come into play as we formalize two downstream student modeling applications for case-studies: knowledge tracing and outcome prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first observation is that patterns in student learning activity – such as video-watching behavior, discussion forum interactions, and other clickstream logs (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a)) – contain signals of student performance in online courses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
Since each student tends to generate a substantial number of activity measurements throughout a course, incorporating them may alleviate sparsity issues faced by prediction models trained on subgroups with fewer students.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second observation is that distinctive patterns of learning activities can be identified both within and across student groups (e.g., different gender groups) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
This was originally discovered among in-person learning behaviors (e.g., participation and learning style), and more recently in digital environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
We thus aim to capture how sequences of learning activities (e.g., viewing a forum, then watching a specific video, then answering a specific quiz question) differ based on student subgroups in our construction of personalized FL models.
However, online learning activities contain more noise than those capture in-person (e.g., a student accessing a video accidentally), making it difficult to identify these patterns through standard data mining techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For example, considering one of the datasets in this paper, Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b) depicts the heatmaps of differences observed when students engage in particular learning activities. Two cases are considered: (b1) between learners across a demographic group (all males vs. all females), and (b2) between learners within a subgroup (50% of the males vs. the other 50%, chosen randomly). Each heatmap value indicates the difference in the fraction of students engaged in the activity at that point in their learning trajectory. (b1) exhibits a more varied set of trajectories than (b2), consistent with the intuition that different subgroups have different learning behaviors, but (b2) still has noticeable differentials even though it is a comparison among a cross-section of the same subgroup. This further motivates our meta-learning approach to subgroup personalization, where any machine-identified commonalities in the data across the subgroups are captured in a global model that is further refinable based on local subgroup information. As we will see in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>, visualizations of the student embeddings learned by our methodology validate that distinctive activity patterns exist between subgroups.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The global modeling stage in our methodology handled two tasks: (i) aggregating the local models and (ii) synchronizing the course models with the resulting parameter vector for subsequent local model training rounds.
Instead of using the standard averaging-based aggregation method from FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, we employ a recently developed attention-based aggregation method, FedAtt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
FedAtt introduces an attention mechanism for weighting local neural network models according to how far the parameters in each of their layers have deviated from the previous global model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.9" class="ltx_p">Open platforms, such as edX and Coursera, usually solicit students’ demographic information when they register, which they can fill out voluntarily.
Instead of considering personalization by courses, we further analyze detailed personalization by students’ demographic in each course.
Following the introduction of dataset partitioning, we further partition the dataset based on students’ demographic information.
In the following, we use the training set as an example to describe the partition criterion; the test set also follows the same rule when partitioning.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.10" class="ltx_p">In addition to construct separate course models, we build separate models for demographic subgroups to facilitate finer granular personalized predictions within each course.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b), we build separate subgroup-personalized models and increase the hierarchy during MLPFL training.
Similar to the meta-learning local model personalization for courses in Sec. <a href="#S2.SS1.SSS2" title="2.1.2 Meta-Learning Personalization for Course-based Local Model ‣ 2.1 Scenario I: Personalized by Course ‣ 2 Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1.2</span></a>, the tasks handled locally are: (i) providing a subgroup-personalized model for global aggregations and (ii) adapting the global model based on the local subgroup dataset.
Our aim is to train a global model that is <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.10.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">easily adaptable</span> to each local student subgroup.
Therefore the optimization problem will change from (<a href="#S2.E1" title="In 2.1.2 Meta-Learning Personalization for Course-based Local Model ‣ 2.1 Scenario I: Personalized by Course ‣ 2 Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) to:</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We collect our datasets from Purdue University’s online courses on the edX platform (<span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\url</span>www.edx.org). We study three graduate-level online courses: Fiber Optic Communications (FOC), Quantum Detectors and Sensors (QDS), and Essentials of MOSFETs (MOSFETs).
Each course consists of a series of lecture videos, some of which have an end-of-video quiz that assesses student learning progress.
Moreover, each course provides a discussion forum page for students to discuss with each other.
The platform also records each student’s final grade, which is a pass or fail label based on the grading policy.
Summary statistics of the three courses are given in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3.1 Datasets ‣ 3 Datasets and Prediction Tasks ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, emphasizing a broad range of activity levels for our evaluation.
The pass rate distributions for each student subgroup are also summarized in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 3.1 Datasets ‣ 3 Datasets and Prediction Tasks ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</p>

Random guessing will result in an AUC of 0.5, while a perfect model has an AUC of 1.
We execute each experiment five times with random initialization for each method and report the average and standard deviation of AUC.
We evaluate on the test set using the model at the training epoch with the highest validation AUC value.
In scenario I, we measure the AUC of the adapted course models obtained after performing one local epoch on the global model for each course.
For scenario II, we measure the AUC after two steps of adaptation: (i) performing one meta-update on the global to form course models, and (ii) performing one local epoch on the course model for each student subgroup.</p>

This is a key motivation for personalization: despite <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc1-G]</span> containing significantly larger training data, it is not preserving course-specific information.
On the other hand, <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc1-G]</span> outperforms both versions of global FL (<span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc1-G-AV]</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc1-G-AT]</span>) in most cases, suggesting that centralized training across the full dataset is at least more useful than decentralized models when personalization is not employed.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Tables <a href="#S4.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>, <a href="#S4.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>, and <a href="#S4.T11" title="TABLE XI ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">XI</span></a>, for knowledge tracing, we observe that the local model <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-L]</span> provides on average 54% AUC on each subgroup according to different demographic groupings , and in Tables <a href="#S4.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>, <a href="#S4.T10" title="TABLE X ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">X</span></a>, and  <a href="#S4.T12" title="TABLE XII ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">XII</span></a>, we find on average 60% AUC for outcome prediction.
While providing moderate improvements over <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc1-L]</span>, these results confirm our hypothesis that small subgroups do not have enough data to train high accuracy models individually..
On the other hand, unlike in scenario I, we see that the centralized global model <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G]</span> does not necessarily outperform the global federated models (<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AV-M]</span>&amp;<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AT-M]</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AV-T]</span>&amp;<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AT-T]</span>).
This is particularly true for underrepresented subgroups.
For example, in Table <a href="#S4.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>, for the MOSFETs dataset, <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G]</span> obtains the highest performance for the male subgroup among the non-personalized models, while two of the global FL models noticeably outperform it on the female subgroup. As another example, in Table 10, for the QDS dataset, <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AT-M]</span> outperforms <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G]</span> noticeably for all subgroups except North America. By systematically incorporating such subgroup heterogeneity, the personalized models are able to obtain substantial improvements across datasets and subgroups, as we discuss further next.</p>

Specifically, for the FOC and QDS datasets, we obtain 15-35% improvement in AUC over the highest performing non-personalized model across subgroups.
The improvements obtained by the personalized models are noticeable but more limited in the MOSFETs dataset, possibly due to its overall smaller size (see Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3.1 Datasets ‣ 3 Datasets and Prediction Tasks ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>).
For both downstream tasks, MLPFL consistently outperforms <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRT</span> except in 4 of the  50 subgroup cases across courses, confirming the benefits offered by our meta learning-based personalization approach. This improvement validates our hypothesis that weighting student subgroups based on their “data quality” as in <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRT</span> may lose important information on subgroup heterogeneity, which is captured by our redefinition of the global model in (<a href="#S2.E6" title="In 2.2.2 Meta-Learning Personalization for Demographic Local Models ‣ 2.2 Scenario II: Personalized by Course and Demographics ‣ 2 Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).
Moreover, <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRT</span> does not consider course-specific modeling, whereas our personalized architecture adapts the student models across different courses and demographics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These results also show how our methodology benefits from the personalization hierarchy. Specifically, in conducting the meta-updates that move from <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AV-T]</span> to <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AV-M]</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-G-AT-T]</span> to <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AT-M]</span>, we find that the course-level personalized models outperform the global models by at least 15% AUC for both downstream tasks.
By considering the lowest-layer subgroupings and performing additional meta-updates that move from <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AV-M]</span> to <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AV-B]</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AT-M]</span> to <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AT-B]</span>, we see that demographic-level personalized models further improve the AUC by 7%-9% on the FOC and QDS datasets over course-level personalized models.
Bulding upon our MLPFL results for scenario I, this shows how our personalization methodology benefits from increasing amounts of information available about students, whereas the non-personalized FL models do not show this trend when moving from top to middle layer modeling.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3.2 Discussion for scenario II ‣ 4.3 Experimental Results ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> compares both the mean and variance in prediction quality obtained across all courses by <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRT</span> and our bottom-layer MLPFL personalization algorithms when modeling for each demographic subgroup.
We can see that MLPFL consistently provides an improvement in mean AUC over <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRT</span>, with the attention mechanism providing an extra boost.
Importantly, we also see that <span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">[sc2-P-AT-B]</span> reduces the AUC variance across subgroups in five of the six cases. The exception case is the one with the lowest variance across all methods.
<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The increase in mean and reduction in variance of prediction quality provided by MLPFL confirms that it lessens the impact of data subgroup availability biases in student modeling.</span></p>

Compared to these, the embeddings learned by federated learning (Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(c)&amp;(d)) also demonstrate clustering patterns according to different courses.

This clustering pattern is correlated with our method’s better inference ability in downstream task prediction: it preserves local attributes pertaining to each course while leveraging global commonalities in student modeling that are present across courses.</p>

It is hard to differentiate different courses and subgroups from the centralized global model (Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(a)).
Starting with the federated global model (Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b)), a more clustered distribution emerges as personalization steps are taken to the middle and bottom of the hierarchy in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(c) and <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(d).
Compared to the course-level personalized model in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(c), the distribution learned by MLPFL personalized by demographic information in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Embedding Visualization ‣ 4 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(d) has denser clusters due to the additional meta-updates.
The same clustering pattern when personalizing according to different continent and age information can be seen from Figure <a href="#A2.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Appendix B Additional Embedding Visualization for scenario II ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> in Section <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Additional Prediction Results for scenario II ‣ Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a> of the Appendix.
These visualizations confirm the ability of MLPFL to adapt a global model to each student subgroup, helping us learn more expressive and predictive representations of student behavior, since we exploit available information unique to each subgroup that would be otherwise discarded.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning (MLPFL) framework for mitigating biases in student modeling stemming from data availability. Our approach is based on meta learning, where local models corresponding to different student subgroups are adapted from a shared global model crafted to incorporate the personalization step.
We applied our framework to two student modeling tasks: (i) knowledge tracing and (ii) outcome prediction, modeling student activities when they interact with an online learning platform.
Our proposed method considers personalization in a hierarchical manner: first by course (if there are multiple courses), and then by student demographic subgroup within each course (if this information is provided to the model).
Evaluation on three online course datasets showed that our methodology outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of improving prediction quality for every course and student subgroup considered.
Moreover, well-organized student embeddings learned by our method were seen to be correlated with improved student modeling.
