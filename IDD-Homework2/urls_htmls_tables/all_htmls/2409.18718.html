<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_text">In this paper, a novel generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)-powered policy learning approach is proposed for optimizing beamforming, spectrum allocation, and remote user equipment (RUE) association in NTNs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for wireless network optimization often rely on manually designed reward functions, which can require extensive parameter tuning. To overcome these limitations, we employ inverse RL (IRL), specifically leveraging the GAIL framework, to automatically learn reward functions without manual design. We augment this framework with an asynchronous federated learning approach, enabling decentralized multi-satellite systems to collaboratively derive optimal policies. The proposed method aims to maximize spectrum efficiency (SE) while meeting minimum information rate requirements for RUEs. To address the non-convex, NP-hard nature of this problem, we combine the many-to-one matching theory with a multi-agent asynchronous federated IRL (MA-AFIRL) framework. This allows agents to learn through asynchronous environmental interactions, improving training efficiency and scalability. The expert policy is generated using the Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), providing data to train the automatic reward function within GAIL. Simulation results show that the proposed MA-AFIRL method outperforms traditional RL approaches, achieving a <math id="id1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="14.6\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">14.6</mn><mo id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">14.6</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.1.m1.1c">14.6\%</annotation></semantics></math> improvement in convergence and reward value.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The vast expanses of the Earth’s surface, predominantly comprising oceans and deserts, present significant challenges in establishing large-scale base stations (BSs) to address the escalating wireless communication demands and the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), with a particular emphasis on satellite-based systems, are rapidly evolving as an extension of terrestrial infrastructure, leading to a substantial increase in remote user equipment (RUE) connectivity and data transmission volumes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Among these, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have attracted considerable attention due to their extensive global coverage capabilities and potential for reliable communication services. Several satellite operators, including Starlink <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, OneWeb <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Amazon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and Boeing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, have launched or are planning to launch LEO satellite networks to serve millions of potential terrestrial terminals. The lower orbital altitude of LEO satellites<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Hereinafter, the term <span id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">LEO satellites</span> will be used interchangeably with <span id="footnote1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">satellites</span> unless explicitly stated otherwise.</span></span></span> results in shorter transmission delays and reduced path loss compared to geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites. Additionally, a constellation of multiple satellites can achieve global coverage. Moreover, technologies such as cellular communication, multiple access, point beam, and frequency multiplexing provide robust technical support for LEO satellite communications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The growing demand for dynamic spectrum resources and the surge in remote user equipments (RUEs) access pose significant challenges to satellite communication networks. To address these challenges, several advanced access schemes have been proposed, including dynamic spectrum access (DSA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), cognitive radio (CR), and the use of multiple spot beams, where DSA leverages deep learning for resource allocation, which requires considerable computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Similarly, NOMA, when integrated with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), enhances spectrum efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Additionally, CR systems improve spectrum utilization by adjusting transmission parameters based on real-time environmental sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Finally, the multiple spot beam technique expands satellite antenna coverage, although it may introduce beam interference issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, to ensure quality of service (QoS) for RUEs while optimizing spectrum efficiency (SE), new network management strategies are imperative. Traditionally, model-driven approaches have been employed to optimize parameters such as beamforming, user association, and spectrum allocation. However, these approaches are often inadequate in dynamic environments characterized by rapid channel fading. Their reliance on repeated iterations and precise channel models renders them computationally intensive and limits their adaptability in real-world applications. Therefore, more efficient, adaptive techniques are required to handle the complexities of modern satellite communication networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements have seen a rise in prominence for self-learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), in the domains of DSA and spectrum sensing. RL enables agents to learn optimal strategies through interactions with their environment (e.g., see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>). However, a key challenge in RL lies in designing an effective reward function for the Markov decision process (MDP) that captures desired objectives while considering the problem constraints. The manual design of the reward function which is composed of objective functions and requires constraints is a complex process and it needs a trial-and-error and time-consuming parameter-tuning process, with limited generalizability to diverse network scenarios. Moreover, optimizing resource allocation in NTNs presents significant challenges. The traditional RL techniques depend on manually designed reward functions which can be susceptible to bias and require extensive simulations to learn. This limits their adaptability and performance in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments. Therefore inverse RL (IRL) offers a solution to this challenge by leveraging an artificial neural network (ANN) as the reward function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The ANN is trained on data obtained from an expert policy, allowing it to learn and refine the reward function through interaction with the environment. Therefore IRL demonstrates effectiveness in handling cellular network management, i.e., power allocation problems as given in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Moreover, to promote cooperation among satellite nodes and enhance training efficiency while preserving privacy, federated learning (FL) is employed. During FL training, nodes upload local model parameters to a central network, which then performs global model aggregation. This fosters both training efficiency and decentralization within the distributed system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above challenges of optimizing beamforming and resource allocation in decentralized satellite networks, the main contribution of this work is to develop a novel framework based on a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)-powered IRL with federated learning (FL) tailored for NTNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Our solution focuses on optimizing satellite-to-RUE links, i.e., beamforming, spectrum allocation, and RUE association while maintaining centralized control over satellite-to-infrastructure (S2I) links through terrestrial gateway station (TGS) where FL enables decentralized collaboration across satellites. First, we introduce an efficient IRL-based approach to maximize spectrum efficiency (SE) under QoS constraints in a multi-user, multi-satellite environment, leveraging a time-varying channel model based on free-space path losses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of IRL to address constrained optimization in NTNs. Second, we implement the GAIL framework within our IRL model to directly derive policies from expert demonstrations, where GAIL-powered policy learning enables us to overcome the limitations of manually designed reward functions, making the optimization process more autonomous and adaptable to dynamic network conditions. Third, we utilize the Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) as an expert policy, generating data to train the automatic reward function. This allows the IRL model to learn from high-quality expert data, enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of the derived policies. By incorporating asynchronous federated learning, our approach facilitates decentralized training across satellite agents, ensuring scalability and adaptability in dynamic NTN environments. This novel IRL-based method sets a new benchmark for NTN optimization, advancing the field towards autonomous and intelligent network management solutions.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been a number of recent works that leverage RL to address various NTN problems. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduces a UE-driven deep RL (DRL) approach, where a centralized agent located at the backhaul of NTN base stations (NTN-BSs) trains a deep Q-network (DQN).

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the NTN’s potential in 6G networks, it still faces key challenges such as long propagation delays, complex resource allocation, and dynamic handover management. These issues are exacerbated by the difficulty of obtaining complete environmental information, making efficient decision-making critical for optimal network performance. While the mentioned works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> present effective solutions for NTNs, they mainly overlook the dynamic and complex nature of spectrum allocation, beamforming, and user association in NTN environments which limits their effectiveness in optimizing network resource allocation. Moreover, RL-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> have shown promise in optimizing NTNs, however, they struggle with scalability, non-stationarity, and the high-dimensional state-action space in dynamic NTN environments. Therefore, To address NTN challenges, we propose a novel MA-AFIRL framework that combines IRL with FL for optimizing beamforming, spectrum allocation, and RUE association, where IRL enhances decision-making by learning reward functions from expert behavior, while FL enables decentralized, privacy-preserving collaboration across satellites. Additionally, an asynchronous update system allows satellites to refine strategies in real time, improving resource allocation and network optimization in dynamic NTN environments.</p>

We consider downlink transmissions with the satellites collaboratively serving multiple RUEs. The NTN’s components are interconnected with the core network, where communication exchange between satellites and TGSs uses satellite-to-infrastructure (S2I) links, necessitating high data rates for efficient data routing. Additionally, satellites communicate directly with each other through optical satellite-to-satellite (S2S) links, also called inter-satellite links (ISLs), when proximal TGSs are unavailable and to cooperatively serve in the constellation. The S2S links support functions such as handover, relaying, and traffic load balancing.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All satellites are assumed to possess regenerative payloads and operate within a LEO constellation, and they use the Ka-band with full frequency reuse (FFR). Optical S2S links enable satellite data exchange, with onboard distributed computing capabilities facilitating computation load sharing. However, the TGSs are positioned statically within the satellite coverage area and periodically transmit constellation topological relationships to satellites via line-of-sight (LoS). In contrast, satellites exchange topological information through S2S links. Moreover, the satellites maintain connectivity with at least one TGS or neighboring satellites during each time interval to receive network management updates despite their periodic positions within LEO constellations. Given the emphasis on dynamic beamforming and RUEs link resource management, previous research has already studied constellation design optimization to mitigate redundancy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.7" class="ltx_p">We next formally pose our problem. Specifically, our decentralized satellite management scheme focuses on optimizing beamforming and resource allocation for satellite-RUE links, while S2I links remain under centralized TGS control.
By carefully allocating satellite resources to each satellite-RUE link and accounting for the effects of S2I links, our goal is to enhance the SE, reduce co-channel interference, and improve the overall reliability of the satellite-RUE communication network. The optimization objective in this context is to maximize the network SE for the hybrid spectrum access system. This goal is achieved while considering limits on delay, reliability, maximum power, and spectrum allocation. Therefore, we will formulate a joint optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total system SE of the multi-satellite cooperative network. We achieve this by jointly optimizing: the beamforming vector for each satellite-RUE link, denoted by <math id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{w}_{s,u}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2a"><msub id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml">𝒘</mi><mrow id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><mo id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml">u</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.3.2">𝒘</ci><list id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2">𝑢</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.2c">\boldsymbol{w}_{s,u}</annotation></semantics></math>, the satellite-to-RUE link selection, denoted by <math id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\chi}_{s,u}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2a"><msub id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml">𝝌</mi><mrow id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><mo id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml">u</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.3.2">𝝌</ci><list id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2">𝑢</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.2.m2.2c">\boldsymbol{\chi}_{s,u}</annotation></semantics></math>, and the spectrum allocation for each satellite-to-RUE link, denoted by <math id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\eta}_{s,u}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2a"><msub id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.cmml">𝜼</mi><mrow id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><mo id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.2.cmml">u</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2b"><apply id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.3.2">𝜼</ci><list id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.1">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2.2.2.2">𝑢</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.3.m3.2c">\boldsymbol{\eta}_{s,u}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Conversely, the capacity is reduced when the satellite relies solely on S2S links for backhaul communication.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Many-to-one matching was chosen as the algorithm for associating satellites with RUEs due to its effectiveness in association management capabilities that ensure scalability and stability of connections by minimizing interference among users matched with satellites. Moreover, the MA-AFIRL method promotes efficient allocation of resources that can easily adapt without depending on humans as satellites improve their decision-making abilities over time. However, it’s important to note that even though these algorithms are becoming more advanced and reaching a peak performance level, they still perform sub-optimally but they do outperform many of the traditional methods that were previously used in similar contexts. A detailed description of each proposed solution approach
is presented in the following subsections.</p>

However, swap matching depends on the performance given the initial matching. Therefore, to achieve the goal of stable initial matching, the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm was proposed and applied to the marriage markets and college admission problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.</p>

The iterative approach continues until every RUE cluster has gotten an acceptable proposal, at which point a stable solution to the RUE association problem is attained. The stability and convergence in many-to-one matching algorithms are not always guaranteed but can be achieved under certain conditions. While stability is possible if the algorithm aims for a stable matching, dynamic factors such as changing user demands or satellite capacities may disrupt it, causing the system to become unstable over time.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present a novel distributed multi-satellite resource optimization algorithm based on MA-AFIRL. The algorithm frames the optimization problem as a MDP and employs a GAIL architecture. Unlike centralized approaches, MA-AFIRL eliminates the need for satellites to upload raw data to a central server, reducing transmission overhead and delay. The proposed MA-AFIRL framework operates within a client-server (i.e., satellite-TGS) architecture, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation Subproblem ‣ 4 Joint Optimization of RUE Association, Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation ‣ Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Satellite agents act as clients, while the TGS serves as the central server. The method implements a client-server architecture that combines IRL and FL, using a SE maximization strategy for multi-satellite systems. Aggregating average algorithms create a global model with strong generalization capabilities. MA-AFIRL enables efficient, adaptive resource allocation without human intervention as satellites improve their decision-making abilities. While this approach outperforms many traditional methods, it still operates sub-optimally despite its sophistication. Subsequent sections provide detailed descriptions of the proposed solution approaches.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.9" class="ltx_p">The IRL framework utilizes ANN to recover the reward function implicitly optimized by an expert policy. Given an expert policy demonstrated by a skilled agent, the IRL approach assigns higher reward values to actions that the expert takes and lower values to alternative actions. Moreover, traditional approaches to joint beamforming and spectrum allocation optimization face challenges when dealing with non-convex problems. MA-RL and existing numerical optimization methods often struggle to find the global optimum in such scenarios, and may only achieve partial local optima after converting the non-convex problem to a convex form. While RL can be effective in finding optimal solutions for less complex communication problems, the convergence speed and even guarantee of convergence become unreliable as the complexity of the agent’s observations, actions, and environment increases. Thus this work proposes an IRL approach to address these limitations and the rationale is given as follows:</p>

To further improve understanding of the IRL framework, a diagram is presented in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation Subproblem ‣ 4 Joint Optimization of RUE Association, Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation ‣ Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. During the training stage, the discriminator network plays two crucial roles: (1) differentiating between expert actions and actions generated by the policy being learned and (2) utilizing this distinction to generate rewards that guide the learning process. Meanwhile, the generator network continuously seeks to improve the pending policy by approximating the expert’s behavior. The generator iteratively generates policies and receives feedback in the form of rewards from the discriminator, allowing it to gradually refine its actions until they closely resemble those of the expert.</p>

Our goal is to optimize the network SE while respecting constraints as mentioned in problem (<a href="#S3.SS5" title="3.5 Problem Formulation ‣ 3 System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.5</span></a>). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hand-crafted reward functions, the proposed IRL method leverages the WOA expert policy for reward generation. Recognizing the potential of the WOA approach to achieve local optima and even approximate global solutions, we adopt it as the expert policy. The rewards are then obtained from the discriminator network based on equation (<a href="#S4.E20" title="In 4.2.2 IRL Learning Architecture ‣ 4.2 Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation Subproblem ‣ 4 Joint Optimization of RUE Association, Beamforming and Spectrum Allocation ‣ Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a>).

A key aspect of IRL methods is the collection and storage of pending policy trajectories (training data) in an experienced pool. Once sufficient data has accumulated, the discriminator network is updated first, followed by the generator network using rewards generated by the discriminator. This iterative process enables the IRL approach to find a sub-optimal solution to the problem (<a href="#S3.SS5" title="3.5 Problem Formulation ‣ 3 System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.5</span></a>) efficiently.</p>

Importantly, when a new satellite enters the desired area, the algorithm creates new connections between satellites and RUEs and reorganizes the RUE clusters to ensure the best possible SE. These results show that the algorithm is effective and can adapt to different situations. By constantly adjusting the connections between satellites and RUEs based on satellite movement and network changes, the algorithm makes sure that SE remains at its highest level throughout the association window. This shows that the algorithm can improve the performance of satellite communication networks in real-world situations, where being able to adapt is essential for efficient and reliable communication.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we explored the problem of optimizing SE in multi-satellite systems. We focused on the challenges of beamforming, spectrum allocation, and RUE association. Traditional RL methods often rely on manually designed reward functions, which can be biased and require extensive tuning. To address these issues, we introduced a novel IRL approach based on the GAIL framework. Our method automatically learns reward functions, eliminating the need for manual design. We formulated an optimization problem to maximize SE while ensuring RUEs’ QoS. This complex problem was solved using a combination of the many-to-one matching theory and the MA-AFIRL framework. This decentralized approach allowed agents to learn optimal policies efficiently through interactions with the environment, improving scalability and performance. The WOA acted as an expert policy, providing data to train the automatic reward function in the GAIL framework. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MA-AFIRL method, which significantly outperforms traditional RL methods like PPO, achieving up to a <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="14.6\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">14.6</mn><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">14.6</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">14.6\%</annotation></semantics></math> improvement in both convergence speed and reward performance. These findings establish a new benchmark for NTN optimization, highlighting the potential of GAIL-powered AFIRL for more autonomous and intelligent network management solutions. This work paves the way for future advancements in NTN optimization and wireless communication.</p>
