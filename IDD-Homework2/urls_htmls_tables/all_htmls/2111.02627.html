<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising method that employs a distributed learning model structure to overcome data privacy and transmission issues paused by central machine learning models. In FL, datasets collected from different devices or sensors are used to train local models (clients) each of which shares its learning with a centralized model (server). However, this distributed learning approach presents unique learning challenges as the data used at local clients can be non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and statistically diverse which decrease learning accuracy in the central model. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing a novel Personalized Conditional FedAvg (PC-FedAvg) which aims to control weights communication and aggregation augmented with a tailored learning algorithm to personalize the resulting models at each client. Our experimental validation on two datasets showed that our PC-FedAvg precisely constructed generalized clients’ models and thus achieved higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emerging Federated Learning (FL) concept was initially proposed by Google for improving security and preventing data leakages in distributed environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">17</span></a></sup></cite>. FL allows the central machine learning model to build its learning from a broad range of data sets located at different locations. It aims to train a shared centralized machine learning model using datasets stored and distributed across multiple devices or clients. This innovative machine learning approach can train a centralized model on data generated and located on multiple clients without compromising the privacy and security of the collected data. Also, it does not require transmitting large amount of data which can be a major performance challenge especially for real-time applications. As such, FL has attracted several application domains in which data cannot be directly aggregated for training machine learning models. Furthermore, FL allows sharing learning in such cases of insufficiency of data availability and lack of other data categories where in most cases data variability is scattered among different sources. This often leads to the unsatisfactory performance of machine learning models, which has become the bottleneck of several application domains. A good example of that is in the civil infrastructures domain specifically in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications where smart sensors are utilized to continuously monitor the health status of complex structures such as bridges to generate actionable insights such as damage detection. Some of these sensors may collect useful data samples that capture potential damage, where other sensors may lack for such patterns (i.e., collect only healthy data samples). In such cases, a FL approach can enable multiple sensors to collaborate on the development of a central learning model, but without needing to share or pool all the data measured from several sensors with each other. This approach can work efficiently and effectively by only sharing the model coefficients of each client model rather than the whole data collected by all participating sensors at each period of time. The learning effectiveness of the model should continue to improve over the course of several training iterations during which the shared models get exposed to a significantly wider range of data than what any single sensor node possesses locally. In this context, the effectiveness of the learning can become dependent on the distribution of the data collected by each sensor in terms of health and abnormal data points.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key problems that impact data-driven machine learning approaches is identifying abnormal patterns in data. In this sense, patterns in data that do not conform to the expected normal behavior are called anomalies or outliers. The process of identifying such non-conforming patterns is referred to as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">anomaly detection</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p2.1.2.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">9</span></a></sup></cite>. Anomaly detection has been useful as it was extensively employed in a variety of applications such as intrusion detection in cyber-security and damage detection in SHM systems. One of the common challenges in anomaly detection problems is that only data representing normal behavior are available while it is difficult or even impossible to gather anomalous samples. For example, in SHM, the occurrence rate of damage is very low, and only healthy or normal data are often available. To address this challenge, a one-class learning process can be employed to construct an anomaly detection model. One-class support vector machine (OCSVM)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p2.1.3.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">22</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">26</span></a></sup></cite> has been widely applied to anomaly detection and become more popular in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p2.1.4.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">2</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">3</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">4</span></a></sup></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, developing an effective and efficient anomaly detection model in such applications like SHM systems requires information derived from many spatially-distributed locations throughout large infrastructure covering various points in the monitored structure. However, consolidating this data in a centralized learning model can often be computationally complex and costly. This motivates for developing a more intelligent model that utilizes the centralized learning model but without the need to transmit the frequently-measured data to one central model for processing unit.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a federated learning approach to overcome the above-discussed challenges of machine learning mechanisms in centralized and distributed settings. Our approach is developed based on Federated Learning (FL) concepts for anomaly detection using OCSVM. OCSVM has been successfully applied in many application domains such as civil engineer, biomedical, and networking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">16</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">1</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">8</span></a></sup></cite>, and produced promising results. Although our approach results in reducing data transmission and improving data security, it also raises significant challenges in how to deal with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data distribution and statistical diversity.
The work proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S1.p4.1.2.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">18</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">12</span></a></sup></cite> has thoroughly investigated the performance of the global model on clients’ local data by showing how the accuracy decreases when the data diversity increases. Therefore, to address the non-IID challenge in our proposed FL approach, we developed a novel method to personalize the resulting support vectors from the FL process. The rationale idea of personalizing support vectors is to leverage the central model in optimizing the clients’ models not only by using FL, but also by personalizing it w.r.t its local data distribution. We also address the communication and aggregation problems that arise in a FL approach where several distributed models (clients) communicate with the central model to report its learning to the central model (the server). The contribution of the work in this study is threefold.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has gained a lot of interest in recent years and as a result, it has attracted AI researchers as a new and promising machine learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">15</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">25</span></a></sup></cite>. This FL approach attracts several well-suited practical problems and application areas due to its intrinsic settings where data needs to be decentralized and privacy to be preserved. However, only a few studies, that have been reported in the literature, utilized the FL approach to construct a global model. For instance, Bonawitz <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S2.p1.1.2.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">14</span></a></sup></cite></span> employed FL model settings to develop a system that solves the problem of next-word prediction in mobile devices. On the other hand, several other studies focused on addressing the training challenges of a central model to support all local data training especially when the distribution of data across clients is highly non-IID (independent and identically distributed).</p>

However, FedProx makes two simple yet critical modifications that demonstrated performance improvements.

Similarly, Manoj <span id="S2.p2.3.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S2.p2.3.6.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">7</span></a></sup></cite></span> addressed the effects of statistical heterogeneity problem using a <span id="S2.p2.3.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalization-based approach (FedPer)</span>.

At the update round, all the clients handshake with the central model using their local loss values. Only clients that its local loss value is below the overall median loss performance will be included in the aggregation at the central model, and the rest will be dropped until the next round. The rationale behind this design is to mitigate the effects of aggregating ’bad’ weights by identifying and not including them. This would cater for different local clients, with varying progress, to perform more local computation. Our PC-FedAvg approach is also centered around employing OCSVM.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.11" class="ltx_p">Our proposed approach may work well when clients have similar IID data. However, it is unrealistic to assume that since data may come from different environments or contexts in FL settings, thus it can have non-IID. Therefore, it is essential to decouple our model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem depicted for personalized FL so the global model optimization is embedded within the local (personalized) models. Geometrically, the global model can be considered as a “<span id="S3.SS2.p1.11.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">central point</span>”, where all clients agree to meet, and the personalized models are the points in different directions that clients follow according to their heterogeneous data distributions. In this context, once the learning process by the central model is converged and the support vectors are identified for each client, we perform a personalized step to optimize the support vectors on each client. Intuitively, to generate a personalized client model, its support vectors must reside on the surface of the local training data (i.e. edged support vector). Thus, we propose a new algorithm to inspect the spatial locations of the selected support vector samples in the context of the FL settings explained above. It is intuitive that an edge support vector <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x_{e}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">e</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">x_{e}</annotation></semantics></math> will have all or most of its neighbors located at one side of a hyper-plane passing through <math id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x_{e}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">e</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">x_{e}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Arch bridge has 800 jack arches to support its joints. Each joint is instrumented by three tri-axial accelerometers mounted on the left, middle and right side of the joint, as shown in Fig <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1.2 Experimental Results of The Arch Bridge: ‣ 4.1 Experiments on Real SHM Data ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ A Personalized Federated Learning Algorithm: an Application in Anomaly Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. We conducted two different experiments using this data. This experiment uses six joints (named 1 to 6) where only one joint (number four) was known as a cracked joint. The data used in this study contains 36952 events as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1.2 Experimental Results of The Arch Bridge: ‣ 4.1 Experiments on Real SHM Data ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ A Personalized Federated Learning Algorithm: an Application in Anomaly Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> which were collected for three months. Each event is recorded by a sensor node when a vehicle passes by a jack arch for 1.6 seconds at a sampling rate of 375 Hz resulting in a feature vector of 600 attributes in the time domain. All the events in the datasets (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) are labelled positive (healthy events), where all the events in dataset 4 (joint 4) are labelled negative (damaged events). For each reading of the tri-axial accelerometer (x,y,z), we calculated the magnitude of the three vectors and then the data of each event is normalized to have a zero mean and one standard deviation. Since the accelerometer data is represented in the time domain, it is noteworthy to represent the generated data in the frequency domain using Fourier transform. The resultant six datasets (using the middle sensor of each joint) have 300 features that represent the frequencies of each event.</p>

It can be concluded from this table that PC-FedAvg outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in detecting damage in the bridge structure.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As validated by the two experiment sets, our PC-FedAvg outperforms alike FL methods in terms of accuracy and personalization of learning with one OCSVM. Like traditional FL approaches, our model reduces frequent data transmission and preserving the privacy of the data as learning occurs at the clients’ models and the learning co-officiants are shared. On the other hand, our model has a unique advantage compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, the personalization effect is fundamental toward achieving better accuracy as our PC-FedAvg personalizes the resultant support vectors to address the problem of non-IID distribution of data in normal FL, and thus it achieves better generalization of the clients’ models. In practice, data collected at different clients (e.g., devices or sensors) is likely to exhibit non-IDD and be statistically diverse. This would impact the accuracy of non-personalized FL methods as it is evident that the accuracy of a global model based on clients’ local data would decrease when the data diversity increased <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><sup id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">18</span></a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:70%;">12</span></a></sup></cite>. Our approach is centered around employing OCSVM as anomaly detection model for damage detection leads to many benefits from the computational perspective, the low resources needed to run the OCSVM algorithm lets to participate in the collaborative learning even though meager resources devices, especially when the type of the kernel function used by the machine learning algorithm is linear. Moreover, the approach we follow of mitigating the effects of aggregating ’bad’ weights by identifying and not including clients based on their local performance which allow us more freedom to perform more local computation. Therefore, our PC-FedAvg is essential to deal with such data issues and to improve the learning effect in FL approaches.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel machine learning approach for an effective and efficient anomaly detection model in such applications like SHM systems that require information derived from many spatially-distributed locations throughout large infrastructure covering various points in the monitored structure. Our method employs a Federated Learning (FL) approach to OCSVM as an anomaly detection model augmented with a method to personalize the resulting support vectors from the FL process. Our experimental evaluation on two real bridge structure datasets showed promising damage detection accuracy by considering different damage scenarios. In the ”Cable-Stayed Bridge” dataset, our PC-FedAvg method achieved an accuracy of 96%. In the Arch Bridge dataset, our PC-FedAvg method achieved 91% damage detection accuracy. The experimental results of these case studies demonstrated the capability of our FL-based damage detection approach with the personalization algorithm to improve the damage detection accuracy.</p>
