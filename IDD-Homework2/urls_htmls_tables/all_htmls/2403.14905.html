<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">In this article, we address the problem of federated learning in the presence of stragglers. For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In intelligent systems, edge devices are generating an increasing amount of data, which can be utilized to train machine learning models for various tasks across a wide range of applications, such as smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and intelligent healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Traditionally, these data are uploaded to a central server for centralized machine learning. However, uploading datasets directly to the central server without privacy-preservation measures raises severe privacy concerns for the edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As an alternative to centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a highly effective tool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Under the FL framework, during each iteration of the training process, local devices compute gradients with their local datasets and send these gradients to a central server. The central server then aggregates the received gradients to update the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In this manner, the edge devices only share locally computed gradients with the central server, significantly enhancing the privacy of raw datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the training process may be hindered by devices known as stragglers, which are significantly slower than others or completely unresponsive due to various incidents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Additionally, in FL, the local datasets on different devices can be highly heterogeneous, meaning they are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) across devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In this case, the presence of stragglers can bias the trained global model due to the absence of the contributions of some devices in each iteration. In other words, stragglers can negatively impact the learning performance of FL, potentially leading to poor convergence. In traditional distributed learning scenarios, the challenges posed by stragglers can be addressed through well-known gradient coding (GC) strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The core concept of GC is replicating the training data samples and distributing them redundantly across the devices prior to training. During each training iteration, non-straggler devices encode the locally computed gradients and transmit the encoded vectors to the central server. Upon receiving these vectors, the central server is able to reconstruct the global gradient, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. However, in FL scenarios, privacy concerns make it impractical to adopt GC techniques and to allocate training data to devices redundantly in a carefully planned manner, as is done in traditional distributed learning scenarios. This is because devices are reluctant to share their local datasets directly with others to create data redundancy considering that their local datasets may contain sensitive or private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For FL problems, to evade the negative impact of stragglers, a new paradigm named coded federated learning (CFL) has been investigated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In CFL, each device uploads a coded version of its dataset to the central server to form a global coded dataset before training begins. During the training process, the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from the global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. Compared with sharing raw datasets as in GC, by carefully designing the way of encoding local datasets in CFL, privacy concerns can be largely reduced, and one can even achieve perfect privacy. However, it is intuitive that encoding the local datasets induces information loss and this may negatively impacts the learning performance. Based on that, the key issue in CFL is how to generate the global coded dataset before training, as well as how to aggregate the gradients at the central server during the training process, in order to achieve better performance in terms of learning and privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There has been some recent progress under the framework of CFL. To be more specific, CFL was firstly investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> for linear regression problems under the FL setting, where local coded datasets are constructed at the devices by applying random linear projections. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the CFL scheme was combined with distributed kernel embedding to make CFL applicable for nonlinear FL problems. Later, to further enhance the privacy performance of CFL, a differentially private CFL method was proposed by adding noise to the local coded datasets, where the differential privacy guarantee was proved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Very recently, a stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL) method has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In SCFL, before the training starts, the devices generate and upload privacy-preservation coded datasets to the central server by adding noise to the projected local datasets, which are used by the central server to generate the global coded dataset. In each iteration of the training process, the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from the global coded dataset with fixed aggregation weights. Compared with previous methods, the advantages of SCFL lie in ensuring that the global gradient applied by the central server to update the global model is an unbiased estimation of the true gradient, and providing the trade off between the privacy performance and the learning performance analytically. However, in SCFL, when the central server aggregates the gradients, it consistently adopts pre-specified and fixed weights across iterations, which neglects the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight results in an unnecessary performance loss, preventing SCFL from achieving the optimal performance in terms of privacy and learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For FL under requirements of privacy preservation and straggler mitigation, to overcome the drawbacks of existing CFL methods as mentioned above, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before training, each device uploads a local coded dataset, which is a transformed version of its local dataset with added random noise. Upon receiving local coded datasets from the devices, the central server generates the global coded dataset. Then, during each training iteration, each non-straggler device computes local gradient based on the current global model and its local dataset, subsequently transmitting this gradient to the central server. After receiving local gradients from the non-straggler devices, the central server estimates the global gradient by aggregating the received gradients and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, applying aggregation weights determined by an adaptive policy. Under this policy, the performance in terms of privacy and learning is optimized, where the learning performance is described by convergence analysis and the privacy performance is measured by mutual information differential privacy (MI-DP). Finally, in order to verify the superiority of the proposed method, simulations results are provided, where we compare the performance of ACFL and the non-adaptive methods.</p>

Here, we focus on linear regression problems under the FL setting for two reasons. First, linear regression is a very important machine learning model that has attracted significant attention recently due to its ability to make scientific and reliable predictions. As a statistical procedure established a long time ago, its properties are well understood, enabling the rapid training of linear regression models in different applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Second, nonlinear problems can be transformed into linear regression problems through kernel embedding methods, demonstrating the broad applicability of linear regression models, as indicated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the problem introduced above under the FL setting, the training process involves multiple iterations. In each iteration, each device computes local gradient based on its local dataset and transmits it to the central server. After aggregating the received gradients, the central server updates the global model and broadcasts the model parameters to all devices. Over the iterations, due to various incidents, some devices may become stragglers, which are temporarily unresponsive, fail to implement computations, and do not send any messages to the central server, unlike the normally functioning devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. It is assumed that the probability of each device being a straggler is <math id="S2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math> in each iteration, and the straggler behavior of the devices is independent across iterations and among different devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

Subsequently, the training process begins, involving multiple iterations. In each iteration, each non-straggler device computes the gradient based on its local dataset and transmits it to the central server. Upon receiving these messages from the non-stragglers, the central server updates the current model parameter matrix using both the received gradients and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. At the end of each iteration, the central server broadcasts the updated model parameters to all devices. In CFL, the core issue is to design the method of generating global coded dataset before training and aggregating gradients at the central server during the training process, so that we can achieve a better performance in terms of privacy and learning. A recently proposed method within the CFL framework is known as SCFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, which generates local coded datasets by adding noise and random projections. The global dataset is then assembled as the sum of these local coded datasets. Throughout each training iteration, the central server employs a weighted sum with fixed and pre-specified weights across all iterations to aggregate the gradients. However, in SCFL, consistently using fixed and pre-specified weights for aggregating gradients without considering the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations results in an unnecessary performance loss.</p>

ACFL is implemented in two distinct stages. Initially, in the first stage prior to the commencement of training, each device transmits a coded dataset to the central server, which is derived by transforming its local dataset and adding noise. The central server then uses these local coded datasets to generate a global coded dataset. Subsequently, in the second stage, the training process involves multiple iterations. In each iteration, the central server aggregates gradient computed from the global coded dataset and the received gradients from non-straggler devices, where an adaptive policy to determine the aggregation weights is applied.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Before the training starts, each device uploads a coded dataset to the central server, which is a common practice under the framework of CFL. In the literature, methods commonly used to generate local coded dataset include random matrix projection and noise injection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Random matrix projection reduces the volume of data transmission by lowering the dimension of the projected data compared to the raw dataset. Meanwhile, noise injection enables privacy enhancement at adjustable levels. Inspired by this, in ACFL, the devices encode the local datasets by adding noise to a transformed version of the local dataset.

As anticipated, an increase in noise variances, aimed at enhancing privacy, inversely affects the learning performance of both methods. This empirical observation aligns with our theoretical analysis, underscoring the intrinsic trade off between privacy preservation and learning performance. Notably, the performance deterioration in ACFL remains relatively modest in comparison to NA upon increasing the noise, while there is a pronounced decline in the learning performance of NA. This discrepancy underscores the superior capability of ACFL to leverage gradients from both the central server and devices more effectively with the adaptive policy and validates the advantage of employing the adaptive policy in ACFL for mitigating the adverse effects of privacy-enhancing measures on learning performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we addressed the problem of FL in the presence of stragglers. For this issue, the CFL paradigm was explored in the literature. However, the aggregation of gradients at the central server in existing CFL methods, which employ fixed weights across iterations, leads to diminished learning performance. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a new method: ACFL. In ACFL, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server before training, enabling the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the received gradients as well as the gradient computed from the global coded dataset by using an adaptive policy to determine the aggregation weights. This approach optimizes the performance in terms of privacy and learning through convergence analysis and MI-DP. Finally, we provided simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared to non-adaptive methods. It is worth noting that in this work, we have focused on the privacy preservation of raw datasets of edge devices. In the future, we plan to extend the proposed method to more complex scenarios, where private information could also be revealed through the analysis of gradients transmitted from the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
