<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the growing concern about the security and privacy of smart grid systems, cyberattacks on critical power grid components, such as state estimation, have proven to be one of the top-priority cyber-related issues and have received significant attention in recent years. However, cyberattack detection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy preservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To address these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated Learning-based privacy-preserving and communication-efficient attack detection framework, known as <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDiSC</span>, that enables <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Di</span>scrimination between power <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">S</span>ystem disturbances and <span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>yberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated Learning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems of decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection model without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a representation learning-based Deep Auto-Encoder network to accurately detect power system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed framework to the timeliness of real-world cyberattack detection in SGs, we leverage the use of a gradient privacy-preserving quantization scheme known as DP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of the proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection accuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related information. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme utilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a traditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which suggests suitability in a real-world scenario.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) in the Smart Grid (SG) paradigm has spawned an unprecedented growth in data volumes generated by edge devices. Such data are particularly vital for numerous key operations of power systems including demand forecasting, grid optimization, monitoring and control of power systems, etc. As such, the overall energy grid system management can be performed more dynamically and efficiently. However, the increase in heterogeneity, diversity, and complexity within the power system infrastructure poses a critical challenge to its integrity. Ensuring data integrity is one of the core missions of modern power systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This is because the ubiquity of modern cyber-physical power grid components coupled with advancements in information technology now enables data processing and decision making at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> as compared to traditional cloud storage-based control centres.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The progress of digital technology has brought about major improvements in the energy critical infrastructure, thus alleviating the modern world’s most crucial problem of how to reconcile the insatiable demand for energy. Despite its significant benefits, SGs still face many technical challenges. Although smart sensing devices play a critical role in the SG paradigm, cyber attacks can impose a serious impact on the integrity and resilience of the system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Many of the SG’s cyber-physical components become potential targets of cyber attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. One such critical cyber attack is <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">False Data Injection</span> (FDI), a critical cyber attack in which malicious adversaries launch severe attacks by corrupting raw sensor measurements or state estimation outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, attackers constantly improve their attack crafting methods to disguise the compromised measurements as natural disturbances/faults such that the detection between malicious and non-malicious events becomes overwhelming and infeasible for bad data detection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is imperative to design effective countermeasures to defend modern power systems against such types of cyber threats.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the recent past, several studies have been conducted to develop defenses against cyber attacks on SGs. Previous works have focused on leveraging machine learning algorithms for cyberattack detection in smart grid systems. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> utilizes a supervised learning-based distributed support vector machine along with alternating direction method of multipliers and achieved sufficient detection performance and lower computation complexities when tested on IEEE standard test systems. Another literature by Anwar, Mahmood and Shah <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> claims that their solution based on Principal Component Analysis and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)-based support vectors outperformed popular machine learning algorithms when tested on industrial control systems datasets. More recently, deep learning approaches have been employed for cyber attack detection due to their superior accuracy against conventional machine learning algorithms. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors developed an unsupervised deep belief network-based detection method which led to satisfactory results when tested on IEEE standard test system. On the other hand, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposes a state-of-the-art deep ensembled learning algorithm to improve FDI detection in a residential demand response context. However, centralized cyber attack detection techniques proposed in numerous previous literature suffer from: 1) limited storage capabilities, 2) communication bottlenecks, and most importantly, 3) <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy</span> issues. Researchers often overlook the fact that power system data may contain sensitive information and its communication to centralized control centres may eventually lead to privacy leakages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges, a promising privacy-preserving distributed learning-based cyber attack detection method that leverages Federated Learning (FL) was proposed. This new machine learning paradigm enables edge devices to train a cyber attack detection deep learning neural network model on-device at the edge with their local training samples, all without requiring the sharing of their local dataset without compromising privacy. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a FL framework for detecting FDI attacks on solar PV DC/DC and DC/AC converters. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> developed an incentive-based federated attack detection on power grid state estimations which is claimed to outperform existing works. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> implemented a federated transformer-based FDI detection system followed by extensive validations on IEEE standard test systems which revealed the effectiveness of their proposed mechanism. Unfortunately, there are limited number of studies that focus on FL for detecting stealthy cyber threats on power control systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose the suitability of a federated cyber attack detection mechanism as a means to discriminate between malicious and non-malicious power system disturbances which relieves the burden of a power system operator to determine whether a certain power disturbance is intentional and thus, provide reliable decision support. We set up distributed power grid zones whereby SCADA sub-systems can locally detect cyber threats instead of uploading data to the control centre, thereby addressing storage capability, communication reliability and privacy issues faced by centralized approaches. In particular, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whilst there are several approaches and directions in cyber attack detection, model-based detection algorithms have garnered huge attention in literature due to their scalability, real-time detection capabilities and non-dependence of system parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For instance, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is one of the earliest to investigate the use of a Gaussian process regression modelling technique based on prior information to develop an early warning system to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks in smart grids. Another work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> trained popular machine learning models such as Random Forests, Naive Bayes, etc. on industrial control datasets and achieved high detection performance. The same further explored the use of different benchmark classifiers such as Random Forest, J48, JRip, etc. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Hao, Piechocki, Kaleshi, Chin and Fan<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed the use of a Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) approach for both random and targeted FDI attack detection. In similar line, Yang, Wang, Zhou, Ruan and Liu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> employed four conventional machine learning models, namely one-Class SVM, Robust covariance, Isolation forest and Local outlier factor method for cyber attack detection and achieved high classification performance after simulation on an IEEE 14-bus system. Another recent study undertaken by Kumar, Saxena and Choi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> addressed the problem of cyberattack detection by training several popular machine learning models such as AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Nearest Neighbours, etc. on a power system dataset to achieve detection accuracy ranging between 70% and 92%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, with the exponential rise of deep learning applications, researchers are actively utilizing newer deep learning algorithms to further advance and improve cyber threat detection in smart grids. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> developed a multi-layer perceptron based approach for improving the resilience of SG systems against FDI attacks. Another work by Niu, Li, Sun and Tomsovic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> developed a CNN-LSTM network for anomaly detection in smart grids which outperformed traditional bad data detectors. Similarly, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> employ a state-of-the-art CNN as a multi-label classifier to defend against potential corrupted measurement threats. Wang, Zhang, Ma and Jin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed the use of a Kalman filter paired with a recurrent neural network demonstrated significantly improved detection rates against cyber attacks on smart grids. More recently, Bitirgen and Filik <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a CNN-LSTM ensembled model combined with particle swarm optimization which achieved high cyberattack detection accuracy rates as compared to existing works.However, there is a privacy issue when separate power grid zones are managed by various system operators, which is a very common scenario in power system networks. And, much of the above literature do not address the problem of user privacy when dealing with such sensitive power related data for detection of cyber threats. Unlike existing research works, our proposed privacy-preserving gradient quantization scheme combined with FL addresses this privacy issue by enabling a computationally-efficient on-device collaborative training of the attack detection model for discriminating between power system disturbances and cyber attacks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a fundamentally novel machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative decentralised on-device training of models without requiring the physical migration of raw data to a centralized server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Since its inception, FL has been applied to several SG applications where privacy is paramount. Taik and Cherkaoui <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> pioneered the application of FL in the smart grid domain by designing a privacy-preserving demand load forecasting framework that required no data sharing. They trained a LSTM model on a real-world Texas load consumption dataset and achieved sufficient forecasting performance to claim the effectiveness of FL in the smart grid domain. Another study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> leveraged FL applications for distributed energy resources forecasting and validated their high forecasting performance using a GridLAB-D simulations and Pecan Street dataset. Similarly, Gholizadeh and Musilek <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and Yang, Wang, Zhao and Wu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> achieved sufficient load prediction performance after employing FL for demand forecasting. Due to its prominence and optimal performance in the demand forecasting application, FL quickly garnered traction in other aspects of the smart grid domain. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> designed a federated temporal convolutional network for energy theft detection. They claimed that, after extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption dataset, their federated framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead. On similar line, Ashraf, Waqas, Abbas, Baker, Abbas and Alasmary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> achieved comparable performance in energy theft detection after employing federated conventional machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets. More recently, there has been few works in relation to federated cyberattack detection. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a FL framework for detecting FDI attacks on solar PV DC/DC and DC/AC converters. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> developed an incentive-based federated FDI attack detection on power grid state estimations which is claimed to outperform existing works. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> implemented a federated transformer-based FDI detection system followed by extensive validations on IEEE standard test systems which revealed the effectiveness of their proposed mechanism. In contrast, our focus in this paper constitutes of developing a federated grid-wide anomaly detection framework for power control systems that enables the discrimination between non-malicious power system disturbances and malicious FDI threats whilst being computationally efficient.</p>

An intuitive workflow of our proposed framework is as follows: 1) The edge IEDs in power grid zones uploads its data securely to a SCADA sub-system. 2) The control centre distributes unanimous model and parameter initialization to all SCADA sub-systems. 3) Local models are trained by each SCADA sub-system with their own local dataset. 4) Each SCADA sub-system updates its compressed gradient to the control centre. 5) The control centre aggregates the uploaded compressed gradients to obtain the latest model. 6) The control centre sends back the model updates to each SCADA sub-system. The steps 1-6 are then repeated until the global model reaches optimal convergence. </figcaption>

The edge-based SCADA sub-systems train the aforementioned shared model locally using their own local dataset, which is collected from the different IED sensing nodes in each respective power grid zones. After local training, the model updates are then shared to the control centre which uses majority-voting aggregation algorithm to average the model updates, thus obtaining an updated global model. The updated model gradients are then shared back to the edge SCADA sub-systems, which will in turn be used for FDI attack detection. The three key actors present in our proposed system model are briefly described as follows: 
<br class="ltx_break">1) <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Control Centre</span>: The control centre is the central facility that monitors and coordinates the grid operations. Typically, the control centre has cloud servers and computational resources which provide sufficient computation power to act as the central orchestrator of the FL set-up. It will be mainly responsible for initializing the global model, broadcasting the model parameters to the edge-based SCADA sub-systems and lastly, aggregating the shared model gradients from the edge-based clients. We assume that the control centre is an honest-but-curious participant, which means that the control centre attempts to learn as much a possible without acting adversarial.
<br class="ltx_break">2) <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SCADA Sub-systems</span>: The SCADA sub-systems are edge-based clients with advanced data acquisition capabilities that play a significant role in the collection and monitoring of data sensed by each sensor device (i.e., IED) within a power grid system. The SCADA sub-systems will act as the FL nodes whereby they will train a local model using their own local dataset and update the compressed gradients to the control centre. Furthermore, we assume that each SCADA sub-system is honest and not curious, in which case they will not be communicating with each other laterally.
<br class="ltx_break">3) <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Power Grid Zones</span>: The power grid zones are considered to be equipped with decentralized monitoring of the SG which consist of sensor networks and IEDs (such as relays, synchrophasors, and so on). The IEDs across the physical power grids constantly sense grid-related data including voltage phase angle, current magnitude, relay status, and so on. The IEDs are assumed to be connected to the SCADA sub-system using high-speed communication network to transmit sensed data frequently.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">The proposed DAE network architecture consists of two symmetrical deep belief networks, the first five shallow layers representing the encoding half of the network and the second set of five shallow layers representing the model’s decoding part. The layers consist of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are the building blocks of deep belief networks. Each RBM layer allows communication between its previous and subsequent layer, i.e., it serves as a hidden layer to the previous nodes and as a visible layer to the subsequent nodes. However, there is no lateral communication between nodes of a single layer. The RBMs are trained using the Contrastive Divergence Algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In addition, all the DAE layers used rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function as it improves the performance of RBMs, is easier to train and often achieves better performance. The reconstruction error is a description of the existence of cyber attacks. In our scenario, the reconstruction error metric selected is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) which acts as a measurement of anomaly degree.

The size of the local model updates increases the communication bandwidth which limits the scalability of our proposed approach to larger number of client nodes.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our proposed architecture using the Mississippi State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory Power System Attack (MSU-ORNL PS) Dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. It consists of 128 features and 1 target marker variable with data logs collected from four Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). A Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) was used to simulate the power system scenario implementation and data generation within a hardware-in-the-loop test bed configuration. Each PMU collected real-time synchrophasor measurement data which includes frequency, current phase angle, current phase magnitude, voltage phase angles, voltage phase magnitude, etc. at a rate of 120 samples per second. For this research, based on the dataset, we assume that an adversary is able to penetrate the power grid zones and launch cyber attacks from within the operational network of each power grid zones. The dataset consists of 15 data files which are binary classes whereby scenarios of Astem disturbances (marked as <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Natural Events</span>) and power systems cyber attacks (marked as <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Attack Events</span>) have been simulated. The cyberattacks include FDI attack and tripping command injection attack, as used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with missing values present within the dataset (which may be a result of SCADA communication failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>), we use a traditional machine learning-based K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) missing value imputation to avoid information loss instead of downsampling. Detection performance typically depends on the appropriate selection of the basis of the feature space. Therefore, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to cull out some features of the data that are difficult to reconstruct such that the remaining features can be represented through a compressed low-dimensional knowledge representation with minimal reconstruction error. A basis of 100 features is determined. Next, we normalize the input data into the range of (0,1) to accelerate model convergence. Lastly, we sample 30% of the dataset for testing the accuracy of the global FDI detection model while the remaining training data is divided amongst distributed power grid zones for FL local model training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated the attack detection performance of our proposed FedDiSC framework to four other popular models used in SG cyber attack detection namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Restricted Blotzmann Machine (RBM). All the competing models are trained in similar FL-based set-up and configuration. We evaluate these models on the MSU-ORNL dataset described in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Dataset and Feature Space Preparation ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>. Initially, we train the FL models on the training sets and we evaluate and compare the accuracy of the global models after training on the MSU-ORNL PS test sets. In Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Attack Detection Performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the experimental validations reveal that the proposed DAE model achieves superior accuracy over all 15 data files. For instance, the accuracy of our proposed DAE model on data1 is 94.8% as compared to the CNN model which is 89.9% or the LSTM model which is 81.5%. Similarly, for data15, the DAE model outperforms the RBM model by 13.6% and the RNN model by 19.9%. This shows that our proposed DAE model has improved robustness to different power grid related datasets which is due to the fact that FL enables learning of features from multiple SCADA subsystems, thereby resulting in improved robustness of the model. Furthermore, we compare the average attack performance of the global DAE model over the test sets as presented in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Attack Detection Performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Attack Detection Performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> using four classification metrics namely accuracy, precision, recall and F-Score. From the experimental results, we observe that the our proposed model outperforms the other competing ones in all three metrics.

Likewise, the recall of our proposed model outshines those of the rivalling models by 1.9%, 14.7%, 19.8% and 15.1% respectively while the F-Score of our proposed model is superior to that of the aforementioned ones by 2.5%, 14.4%, 20.4% and 15.7% respectively.</p>

Among those competing models, only our proposed model is trained in a federated learning set-up while the remainder are centralized ones. In Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Attack Detection Performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we evaluated the accuracy of our proposed global DAE model against four different centralized traditional machine learning models over all 15 data files.

Similarly, for data 15, the accuracy of our proposed model outshines that of RF and SVM by 12.9% and 10.0% respectively.

For instance, our proposed FL approach achieves higher precision compared to LR, RF, NB and SVM by 19.6%, 13.4%, 24.6% and 17.3% respectively. This may be due to the fact that deep learning algorithms are superior to the performance of traditional machine learning models as they try to learn high-level features from data in an incremental manner and improve with larger datasets. On the other hand, our experimental validations reveal that Naive Bayes has the worst overall performance amongst all the models used for comparison purposes and achieved an attack detection accuracy of merely 69.7%.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, we compare the results of our proposed FL-based cyber attack detection framework against that of state-of-the-art literature within this topic. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> developed a hybrid intrusion detection system using common paths mining algorithm and evaluated their proposed approach on similar dataset.

Similarly, in comparison with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, we achieved improved accuracy of cyber-attack detection.

Specifically, we contrast the training time of the models, between the proposed FL framework with Gradient Quantization (GQ) and the traditional FL approach without GQ.

This is due to the fact that the privacy-preserving GQ scheme utilized in our proposed FL framework decreases the byte size of the gradients shared during the control centre and SCADA subsystem to one-bit without compromising the accuracy of detection of the model as discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Attack Detection Performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.</p>

Similarly, a brief comparison against state-of-the-art reveals comparable performance which validates the real-world application of our proposed method for cyber attack detection. Furthermore, we improve the communication efficiency of the proposed FL architecture with a differentially private SIGNSGD-based gradient quantization scheme that conforms to the privacy-preserving nature of FL.

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While sufficient model performance is vital metric for effective FDI attack detection and has been achieved in our work, it is worth discussing that our proposed approach significantly differs from previous works as we also take into account the security and privacy of sensitive power related information. We restrict the training of models to only edge-based SCADA sub-systems on their local datasets which eliminates the need of data sharing to the control centre and raw data access by unauthorized attackers. Furthermore, the use of a privacy-preserving gradient quantization scheme complemented with differential privacy tackles the severe deep gradient leakage drawback suffered by FL algorithms. Adversaries are unable to get access to the raw gradients of the models shared during training and are thus, unable to extract sensitive power related information or even reconstruct the raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Throughout this manuscript, we propose a novel communication efficient and privacy-preserving on-device federated learning-based intrusion detection approach for power systems disturbance and cyberattack discrimination in smart grids. First, we propose a federated learning-based framework that enables power sensing devices to collaboratively train the intrusion detection model without requiring the need for data sharing which tackles the problem of data privacy. Second, we propose a representation learning-based auto-encoder for accurate discrimination between natural power disturbances and cyberattack events. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a popular binary power system dataset and compare it to several other machine learning/deep learning algorithms. The experimental results show that the auto-encoder model achieves superior accuracy over other methods on this particular dataset. Lastly, we propose the use of a sign-based gradient quantization scheme to enhance the communication efficiency of our proposed federated learning framework. The experimental findings show that this gradient quantization mechanism decreases the training time by nearly 40%, proving that quantized gradients improve communication efficiency.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we aim to improve the robustness of the power system intrusion detection models by leveraging ensembled learning methods. Furthermore, we will focus on researching techniques to improve the security of our federated learning framework, as one of our previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> highlights that federated learning frameworks are vulnerable to byzantine attacks.</p>
