<p id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning involves training statistical models over remote devices such as mobile phones while keeping data localized. Training in heterogeneous and potentially massive networks introduces opportunities for privacy-preserving data analysis and diversifying these models to become more inclusive of the population. Federated learning can be viewed as a unique opportunity to bring fairness and parity to many existing models by enabling model training to happen on a diverse set of participants and on data that is generated regularly and dynamically. In this paper, we discuss the current metrics and approaches that are available to measure and evaluate <span id="id6.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fairness</span> in the context of spatial-temporal models. We propose how these metrics and approaches can be re-defined to address the challenges that are faced in the federated learning setting.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding human mobility based on location-based data generated by smartphone devices has become a fundamental part of the urban and environmental planning in cities. Through collection of these geo-traces, it has become possible for the scientific community and policy-makers to model citizens’ daily commutes using crowd-sensed car-share data (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), city bicycles (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and RFID transportation cards (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), or to build predictive algorithms to estimate people’s flows (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and community structure (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A current underlying assumption of these models is that there exists a large-scale centralized repository of location data that can be leveraged to train these models. However, collecting large-scale location data from citizens over a long period of time is not an easy task and poses three substantial challenges. First, there are participation barriers due to privacy concerns associated with location data. Indeed, past research has shown that out of all different data types, people are least likely to be willing to share location data (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Secondly, due to the enormous effort that is associated with collecting such large repositories of mobility trace, the data collection is often done infrequently. Efforts such as Mobile Data Challenges (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and Data for Development challenges (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) are an example of this type of large scale data collection that have advanced research in urban and social computing. These types of collected traces, however, quickly become outdated and only capture a static snapshot of the citizens’ behavior over a given window of time. Thirdly, research has shown that most centralized spatial-temporal datasets are polluted by systemic socio-economic and racial discrimination (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), and thus the algorithms that model such data need to be actively adjusted to avoid reinforcing biases, without the possibility to go collect additional data.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the first two challenges, a handful of decentralized technologies are being experimented to address this issue, of which Federated Learning (FL) (<span id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) is earning trust as a more promising approach. FL relies on end-device to train on their local training data and share global ML model weights with the FL central server. FL empowers the end-devices to train the local model with their local data and share the benefits of the aggregated global model from <math id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx1.p3.1.m1.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> clients. In the context of smart city, the mobile crowdsensing community has recently started to explore alternatives and possibilities of a paradigm shift that would decouple the data collection and analysis from a centralized approach to a distributed setting (<span id="Sx1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>)</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, for such a paradigm shift to work, the research community needs to address the third challenge that is to ensure fairness is achieved in a such setting. In order to do so, a set of metrics for measuring and evaluating <span id="Sx1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fairness</span> in the context of spatial-temporal FL models are required. In this work, we examine such systems through the lens of fairness, review, and define various approaches to guarantee fairness in FL. In so doing, we rely on the methodology defined by Friedler et al. (<span id="Sx1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and examine the fairness criteria of the FL models under the two views of the world as defined based on the mechanism of mapping construct to the observed space. Specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions:</p>

<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RQ1: How can the fairness metrics be defined for spatial-temporal applications in the context of privacy-preserving FL models?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">If we are able to define a set of metrics for measuring fairness based on <span id="Sx1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RQ1</span>, at which stages of the training and how can we ensure the outcome of the FL model is fair? That is:</p>

<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">RQ2: How and what approaches should be applied to ensure fair FL models?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we first review the related work in the context of spatial-temporal machine learning models and applications specific to the FL domain. We then cover the broader review of fairness in machine learning and describe the existing metrics and processes that are commonly used in the literature, describing the challenges of applying them to the FL setting. We then define a set of fairness criteria and metrics specific for the spatial-temporal applications and posit various strategies and stages that fairness can be embedded into FL models.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Related Work</h2>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we review the related literature categorized into two groups of related mobility works that tackle applications of smart city and mobility models, before exploring the more recent models of federated learning in the spatial-temporal applications.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Smart City and Mobility Models</h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Predicting dynamic urban activities such as traffic flow, visitation patterns, and public safety has become a fundamental task for the public and private sectors. For example, mobility system operators such as ride-hailing and bike-share companies often use accurate demand estimates to guide resource optimization and maximize system utility (<span id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The empowering component of these modern prediction systems is having access to a large amount of mobility traces of citizens paired with advanced machine learning techniques. For example, traditional time series models such as ARIMA and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) have been extensively used in the context of smart cities to predict urban events (<span id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>; <span id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). More recently, advanced deep neural networks have become popular for modeling complex spatio-temporal data as mobility data has been shown to exhibit non-linearity. For many of these models, the only assessment is measuring the accuracy of the predictions, which can help allocate city-wide resources and implement policies.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Applications of Federated Learning in Smart Cities </h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To date, research in real-world applications of federated learning in smart cities are still in their infancy and limited to a handful of examples. Smart urban security (<span id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) is an emerging field that has seen the most integration of federated learning in the context of smart cities. Based on machine learning, smart security can perform post-event analysis and self-learning, constantly accumulating experience, and continuously improving pre-warning capabilities. Federated Learning offers a machine learning training scheme that allows the use of large amounts of collected data in daily applications (<span id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Outside of security applications, Mashhadi et al. (<span id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) proposed an application of federated learning for discovering urban communities. They showed that by using the GPS traces that are stored on each device and collaboratively training a deep embedded clustering model, it is possible to detect meaningful urban communities without the need for location information to be shared.</p>

<section id="Sx3" class="ltx_section">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Fairness in Machine Learning</h2>

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness in ML is defined as either individual fairness or group based fairness. The most adopted metrics for fairness in machine learning are widely based on group based fairness which is also known as Statistical parity and Demographic parity (<span id="Sx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). These metrics aim to ensure that there is independence between the predicted outcome of a model and sensitive attributes of age, gender, and race. Variations of statistical parity exist which concentrate on relaxation of this measure by for example ensuring that groups from sensitive attribute and non-sensitive attribute meet the same mis-classification rate (False Negative Rate) also known as Equalized Odds (<span id="Sx3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), or equal true positive rate (also known as Equal opportunity (<span id="Sx3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>)).
On the other hand, individual fairness claims that similar individuals (with respect to a specific task) should be treated similarly with respect to that task. Much of the research on fairness in machine learning can be framed in an optimization context, where the goal is to maintain good predictive performance while satisfying a number of group-level or individual fairness constraints. Next to algorithmic approaches, also progress has been made with respect to theoretical analysis to better understand the possibility or impossibility of fairness with its different and often conflicting notions. In (<span id="Sx3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), authors proposed a framework for understanding different definitions of fairness through two views of the world: <span id="Sx3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i) We are all equal (</span><span id="Sx3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">WAE</span><span id="Sx3.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">) and ii) What you see is what you get (</span><span id="Sx3.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">WYSIWYG</span><span id="Sx3.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">)</span>. The framework shows that the fairness definitions and their implementations correspond to different axiomatic beliefs about the world described as two worldviews that are fundamentally incompatible. It suggests that if an application follows the WAE worldview, then the demographic parity metrics are relevant. For applications that follow the WYSIWYG worldview, then the equality of odds metrics are suitable for measuring fairness. Other group fairness metrics such as equality of opportunity lie in-between the two worldviews and are recommended to be used appropriately.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness in ML can be achieved in three different stages: pre-processing the data, in-processing where the model is modified to become fair, and post-processing where the outcome of the model is tuned to meet the fairness criteria.</p>

<div id="Sx4.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Literature in fair federated learning is still in its infancy and often framed as equal access to effective models. That is the majority of the literature sees the goal of a Fair FL model as training a global model that incurs a uniformly good performance across all devices. For example, Agnostic Federated Learning (AFL) (<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and AgnosticFair (<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) optimize the worst weighted combination of local devices. Other techniques approach fairness at the time of aggregating the models, such as those FedMGDA (<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) and q-FFL (<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), re-weight the loss functions such that devices with poor performance will be given relatively higher weights. These works have so far tried to define fairness as a one-fits-all and independent of the use cases and applications that the FL models are applied. For example, in the context of location data, approaches such as q-FFL that merely consider the number of data-points per device to account for fairness will fall short as in the case of location data frequency, regularity, and entropy is far closer indicators of the usefulness of the data than volume. That is two participants with an identical number of spatial-temporal data points could correspond to two distinct behavior of one being mostly stationary and the other having a very diverse trajectory portfolio (e.g., a taxi driver).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the experimental results of measuring fairness in FL literature have been arbitrary. In one study (<span id="Sx4.SSx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), authors define biases in terms of the color of the handwritten digits in MNIST (blue versus black group). Such studies fail to address biases as contextual and societal driven. We argue that biases in spatial-temporal applications are highly driven by manifestation of socio-economic and demographic geographical challenges. Thus a generic design of fairness methods misses the required perspective of fairness that is needed for these applications. In this paper, we aim to define a set of methods and roadmap to bring fairness to FL models that are applied in the context of spatial temporal application.</p>

Such constraint means that we need to consider new ways of applying fairness in i) pre-processing by limiting the observations to the devices, ii) in-processing by applying fair regularizers that work at global level and and ii) post-processing stages.
In the other hand, FL is able to reduce the gap between the observed features and the construct features as it removes the need for data collation and sharing procedure. This property allows us to define a set of metrics that enable us to measure fairness by considering individual’s trajectory. Relying on these constraints and opportunities, we address the two research questions in the subsequent sections.</p>

To the best of our knowledge (<span id="Sx5.SSx2.SSSx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>) is the only work in literature which offers a group-based fairness metric for spatial-temporal data. However, their work focuses on per area demand prediction, where as in the context of our study we are focused on data generated by individuals devices and reflects historical mobility information of the user. Assuming the prevalence of such data, we can define group-based fairness as conditional independence:</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Applying fairness in pre-processing stage often includes data augmentation and debiasing of the input to account for a more representative distribution of the population. In the FL setting, given that the data stays local on the devices and is not visible to the FL server, any pre-processing intervention would translate into participant selection strategies. That is for any FL model to be fair and inclusive, it must be trained on a diverse representation of the data, requiring a diverse set of participants to be included in the training stages. Thus, a participant selection strategy that selects devices based on their group membership to achieve either group-based or individual fairness is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve group-based fairness in this stage, the FL server can indicate the number of required participants from each group and select devices uniformly across the groups. Existing algorithms such as those that aim to select participants based on incentives or resources (e.g., battery, WiFi, etc) can be used to meet these selection criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve individual fairness in this stage, additional computation at the device level is required. That is first the notion of similarity amongst individuals needs to be calculated and groups of similar individuals to be detected.
As this notion of fairness requires access to devices location data in order to compute the one-to-one similarity across users, it requires any FL model to be embedded with a federated clustering algorithm to first discover the clusters of similar individuals and then apply participant selection for ensuring fairness amongst members of same cluster.</p>

</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To validate this participant selection strategy, we used Mobile Data Challenge(MDC) Dataset (<span id="Sx6.SSx1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). The MDC dataset contains a large variety of data collection sensors including an accelerometer, phone records, wireless access points, Bluetooth connection, and GPS recordings. For the purpose of this work, we are only concerned with the geo-location data as time-series records. The mobility traces were contributed by 185 users from 2009 to 2011 sampled 6 times per second. We applied the FM algorithm described earlier to create heatmaps based on each user’s trajectory.

This algorithm relies on representation learning to optimize a convolutional autoencoder for two optimization tasks of learning the representation of the images from each user (minimizing reconstruction loss) and maximising the clustering by adding a clustering layer that aims to reduce KL-divergence. The results in Figure <a href="#Sx6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Pre-processing ‣ RQ2: Stages of Applying Fairness in FL ‣ Fairness in Federated Learning for Spatial-Temporal Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the viability of selecting the participants based on their cluster membership where users with similar SSIM should be treated similarly.

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">In-processing</h3>

<div id="Sx6.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In-processing approaches rely on adjusting the model during the training to enforce fairness goals to be met and optimized for in the same manner as accuracy is. This is often achieved through adversarial networks or fair representation learning approaches such as (<span id="Sx6.SSx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>), model induction, model selection, and regularization (<span id="Sx6.SSx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Such approaches in the traditional ML however would not be applicable to federated learning as they rely on centralized datasets that would collectively include a wide representation of the data from users from different groups. In the context of FL each round of local training is performed on local data that belongs to individual users and thus it is not possible to apply regularization techniques without further intervention. One possible approach to leverage the existing in-process approaches in FL is to rely on the FL server to send additional data to local devices at each round of training, where this data can be merged with local data to enable regularization to happen. However, such approach will be very cost inefficient and will incur a large amount of communication across the server and the devices. Alternatively approaches could rely entirely on the local data but achieve in-process fairness through parameter-tuning by searching the most optimal and fair parameters for each device. We believe such approaches are highly desired for the FL community and are vital to shape the future roadmap of Fairness in FL.</p>

<section id="Sx6.SSx3" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Post-Processing</h3>

<div id="Sx6.SSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of FL, we refer to post-processing as the set of processes that occur on the FL server after each round of local training. Thus, accounting for fairness in aggregating the weights of the trained models could serve as a natural choice. For example, different aggregation methods at the server where different weights based on either group membership or similarity can be taken into account when aggregating the models (<span id="Sx6.SSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Alternative to aggregation approaches, post-processing stage could be also considered as an opportunity to audit the trained models using synthetic data. That is at the end of each round of training on local devices, the FL server could evaluate the accuracy and fairness of the model on a centralized dataset that includes the sensitive attributes. GAN based approaches can be used to create fair representation of the previously collected spatial dataset for this auditing purposes.
Such auditing can serve as a feed-back loop into informing the distribution of the participants for the next round of training (pre-processing) and the hyper-parameter setting of the model (in-processing).</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we defined a set of metrics for measuring the fairness of the spatial-temporal models based on the observed and construct feature space. We showed how FL can help by removing some privacy concerns and allowing for more detailed observable features space. Relying on fairness literature we defined fairness in macro and micro levels for mobility data and showed how FL models can account for fairness in three stages. Our study calls for the research community to pursue future research in creating novel approaches in applying in-process fairness into FL models. We expect to see more application specific works and studies that will leverage pre and post-processing approaches defined here to gaurantee fairness. Finally, we believe conceptual works such as ours are particularly needed to enable discussion and conversation around how to measure fairness in a different context and how to create models that are audit-able when trained in the FL setting. We believe topic of fairness and transparency in FL is to be a vital topic for AAAI community to pursue and explore.
