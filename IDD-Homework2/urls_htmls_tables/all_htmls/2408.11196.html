<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Advances in machine learning algorithms for sensor fusion have significantly improved the detection and prediction of other road users, thereby enhancing safety. However, even a small angular displacement in the sensor’s placement can cause significant degradation in output, especially at long range. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple yet generic and efficient multi-task learning approach that not only detects misalignment between different sensor modalities but is also robust against them for long-range perception. Along with the amount of misalignment, our method also predicts calibrated uncertainty, which can be useful for filtering and fusing predicted misalignment values over time. In addition, we show that the predicted misalignment parameters can be used for self-correcting input sensor data, further improving the perception performance under sensor misalignment.</p>

In the bottom image, after applying the extrinsic parameter correction predicted by our model, the LiDAR points are well-aligned with the camera data, leading to improved 3D object detection accuracy.</span></figcaption>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The multimodal perception systems combine the strengths of different sensors, providing a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings. For example, camera data offers high-resolution visual information, while LiDAR excels at accurately mapping the 3D environment, and radar is adept at detecting and tracking moving objects even in challenging weather conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Sensor fusion algorithms and models rely on intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters to integrate these different sensors. These parameters define the precise spatial relationships and transformations between the various sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar) and the vehicle’s coordinate frame. These parameters are determined through a process known as calibration. Any deviations from these predetermined extrinsic parameters, caused by factors like vibrations, impacts, or thermal effects, can lead to inconsistencies in the sensor data fusion process. Consequently, this can result in erroneous object detection, localization errors, and ultimately, compromised decision-making capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For self-driving highway applications, especially heavy-weight trucks, autonomy is highly susceptible and requires extra attention due to the longer stopping distance requirement. A deviation of just 5 milliradians translates to an error of 2.25 meters at 450 meter range, resulting in a complete mismatch of the fused image and LiDAR data, and enough lateral error to place a vehicle on the wrong lane.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Monitoring the relative positions of onboard sensors can be crucial for safe operations. If the sensors’ positions are found to have deviated from their original locations, the planner system of the autonomous vehicle (AV) can take appropriate actions to mitigate risks to acceptable levels, such as stopping on the shoulder or reducing speed. In addition to monitoring, it is essential that the perception models used for detection and tracking tasks are robust against deviations from predetermined calibration parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a system that integrates the misalignment monitoring task with a 3D detection task. We limit our work to only angular displacement in this paper as translational displacement (a few millimeters) has minimal impact on sensor measurements compared to the inherent variability (variance) present in the sensor’s output.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve this, we integrate a misalignment prediction head to a base detection network-trunk, and we train the network end to end. This solution leverages joint multi-task learning, offering potential benefits in terms of increased robustness of object detection, accurate misalignment prediction, and efficient computational resource utilization. This approach enables the system to self-correct the alignment errors, enhancing the robustness of long-range detection. Our approach leverages aleatoric (data) uncertainty <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which captures the inherent noise and stochasticity in the input sensor data. By explicitly representing this uncertainty in the network’s outputs, we can provide well-calibrated confidence estimates for the predicted misalignment values. This enables better-informed decision-making and risk-averse behavior in situations with high uncertainty.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The extrinsic calibration parameters, a 6-DoF transformation between different sensors, are particularly critical in highway driving due to their operational characteristics. High speed vehicles (specially trucks) require significantly longer stopping distances, necessitating the ability to detect even small objects like a construction cone or a pedestrian at a long range, often up to 450 meters. Performing sensor fusion at these ranges requires a very high degree of precision of each sensor’s extrinsics parameters.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Calibration</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, LiDAR and camera offline calibration can be categorized into target-based and target-less methods. Target-based calibration, relies on reference objects such as checkerboards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, ArUco <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and circular grid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to forge a correspondence between LiDAR data and camera images. These methods typically leverage distinctive features like planes and corners to optimize the calibration process, providing high precision within controlled environments. However, they are often constrained by the necessity of such constrained settings.
In contrast, target-less methods emphasize the use of natural environmental features for calibration. This trend moves away from the need for controlled environments by exploiting scene-based features (e.g., lines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and edges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>). Sensor motion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> based methods are also introduced to further reduce the dependence on scene-based features. These methods offer a more flexible approach and can be applied in situations without the need for elaborate setups. However, maintaining desired level of calibration precision is challenging due to varying environmental and operational factors such as temperature changes, road vibrations, and equipment wear and tear, all of which can introduce calibration errors on an initially well-calibrated system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, online calibration is needed to better handle these conditions on the road. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, authors monitored the calibration by computing alignment between image edges and projected LiDAR points. An objective function is proposed to model the information of discontinuity from the image and the depth from LiDAR points. Additionally, inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks, online learning-based approaches are also introduced to calibration. RegNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the first deep convolutional neural network for LiDAR-camera calibration marks a significant breakthrough in this field. It is trained on a large amount of miscalibration data to accurately estimate extrinsic parameters. Later end-to-end networks like CalibNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduce a geometric supervision method to increase their precision, and LCCNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> exploits a cost volume layer for feature matching, which allows it to express the correlation between different sensors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although online calibration methods have been introduced, it’s important to acknowledge that perfect calibration might not be achievable and the perception system must also be robust enough to handle unexpected discrepancies in sensor data. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> achieves impressive mean error in yaw orientation estimate. However, it is still high enough that LiDAR points corresponding to a pedestrian at a 400-meter range would be projected laterally onto a different lane. Moreover, these methods are not multi-task methods and require a standalone deep network alongside a detection network increasing the cost for resource-constrained platforms.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Robust 3D detection</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of 3D object detection, especially when working with LiDAR point clouds, data augmentation is crucial to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the detection models. Scaling, rotation, translation, and flipping of the entire point cloud, are common global augmentation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Local augmentations, focusing on individual objects within a point cloud, include techniques like rotation, scaling, and translation of specific ground truth boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, innovative techniques like PointMixup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which employs interpolation between point clouds, and InverseAug <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which focuses on reversing augmented features and understanding the correlations between LiDAR and camera features during fusion, have been introduced. Each method offers a unique contribution to enhancing LiDAR point cloud data when leveraging multi-modality fusion, leading to more accurate and dependable 3D object detection. However, none of these methods explicitly perform perturbation of the extrinsic parameters directly. In our method, we argue that, in addition to the mentioned augmentation and feature interpolation, explicitly perturbing the relative transformation can provide enhanced robustness against sensor misalignment.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we use CenterNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> as our base model.
CenterNet consists of a convolutional backbone network for feature extraction and decoding heads to output heatmaps and offsets. In this work, we adopt a similar structure, employing VoVNetV2<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> as the CNN backbone. Initially, the image is processed through a stem network consisting of two fully convolutional layers with 32 and 64 dimensions, and kernel sizes of 7 × 7 and 3 × 3, respectively. The first layer utilizes a stride of 2, reducing the feature resolution to half the original. The LiDAR depth image is then downsampled to half resolution and concatenated with the image feature map. This combined feature map is fed into the VoVNetV2 feature extractor, which operates through eight stages. The first four stages perform a 2× downsampling, while the subsequent stages upsample the feature map back to half resolution.
At each up-sampling stage, the depth image is resized and concatenated with the feature map before being fed into the next stage. Finally, the feature maps are passed through a 1 × 1 convolution to decode the outputs. For object category (user-defined channels), 2d center (2 channels), 2d size (2 channels), 3d centroid (3 channels), 3d size (3 channels), range (1 channel), and orientation (1 channel), each output heatmap is of size (H/2 × W/2) × individual channels. Additionally, the head produces the LiDAR miscalibration output, which consists of three scalar values representing pitch, yaw, and roll in degrees.</p>

The network takes in RGB image and LiDAR points projected onto a virtual image. During the training, projected LiDAR points are perturbed in a controlled fashion, and the network is tasked to predict the parameters of that perturbation along with detecting and classifying 3D objects in the scene. This synthetic data augmentation and training technique ensures the model is robust to small perturbations in real-world scenarios.</span></figcaption>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We employ a fault injection methodology that simulates misalignment conditions by perturbing the extrinsic parameters on a carefully curated test dataset. Specifically, we introduce controlled misalignment by altering the extrinsic parameters of the LiDAR sensor, which defines its spatial orientation and position relative to the vehicle’s coordinate frame. These faults are injected by perturbing the roll, pitch, and yaw angles within a range of -1.0 to 1.0 degrees of rotation. This range is selected to emulate realistic scenarios where minor misalignments can occur due to factors such as vibrations, impacts, or thermal effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By systematically injecting these perturbations across the test dataset, we can comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method in detecting and quantifying the misalignment, as well as assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies, such as self-correction of extrinsic parameters.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate our proposed approach, we leverage our diverse internal dataset. Our focus in this study is mainly the degradation in long-range detections due to small misalignments. This limits us from using publicly available datasets such as Waymo Dataset which provides 3D labels only until 85 meters range <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and KITTI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> with max range of 120 meters. Our internal proprietary dataset provides 3D bounding box labels up to 500m range using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR system. It comprises 43,500 five-second snippets for training and 1,000 for validation, featuring synchronized 8MP camera images with a 30° field of view, LiDAR data from FMCW LiDAR system. More importantly, this dataset enables us to verify our method’s effectiveness on distant objects (upto 500 meter range) under diverse conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the dataset, we extract 5-second long continuous snippets of sensor data stream. To simulate realistic misalignment scenarios, we employ purpose built fault injector tool to perturb the incoming LiDAR point data within each snippet, introducing roll, pitch and yaw perturbations uniformly sampled in the range of [-1 degree to 1 degree] with an interval of 0.1 degree with total 1000 snippets of data.</p>

Additionally, we measure the 3D detection performance of our multi-task model against a baseline and ensure that our module-level mitigation method strictly increases perception performance across all conditions (see Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.1.2 Evaluation Metrics ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setting ‣ 4 Verification ‣ Robust Long-Range Perception Against Sensor Misalignment in Autonomous Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). We employ the max F1 score metric (IoU=0.1) to evaluate the Bird’s Eye View (BEV) object detection performance for actors at different ranges under various fault injection scenarios. As a baseline, we show the result from the model that is not trained with any perturbation. We compare the results of our proposed network architecture with and without applying the correction. This comprehensive evaluation helps us demonstrate the tangible benefits of our mitigation strategy in improving perception robustness and maintaining reliable operation in the presence of sensor misalignment faults.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section evaluates the performance of our proposed approach and its impact on enhancing safety across various driving scenarios. For system-level failure mitigation, we focus on the Misalignment Detection Accuracy (MDA) metrics, specifically precision and recall. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1.1 Dataset ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setting ‣ 4 Verification ‣ Robust Long-Range Perception Against Sensor Misalignment in Autonomous Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the results demonstrate the high precision and recall achieved by our method in detecting sensor misalignment across different conditions. Furthermore, incorporating uncertainty estimates in the Per Snippet evaluation leads to improved misalignment estimation accuracy, as evident from the lower Mean Estimated Error values.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The table also presents the mean L1 error for the three misalignment dimensions (pitch, roll, and yaw) considered in this work. By combining the table results with the misalignment estimates in the plot (Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4 Verification ‣ Robust Long-Range Perception Against Sensor Misalignment in Autonomous Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) of the injection LiDAR misalignment, we see that the model demonstrates promising performance in estimating yaw misalignment but struggles with roll misalignment. This behavior could be due to the differences in vertical and horizontal resolution for the LiDAR. LiDAR has a slightly higher horizontal resolution, which makes estimating yaw miscalibration easier compared to Pitch. The roll noise is only visible at the very edge of the image, which typically consists of feature-less areas such as the sky or the ground surface closer to the camera (see Figure <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Robust Long-Range Perception Against Sensor Misalignment in Autonomous Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), making it more difficult for the model to observe feature displacement due to misalignment in roll.</p>

We observe that the multi-task model significantly improves detection performance compared to the baseline when evaluated on the same miscalibrated data. Furthermore, when applying correction (see qualitative example in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Robust Long-Range Perception Against Sensor Misalignment in Autonomous Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) using the predicted misalignment values, the performance improves for ranges beyond 200 meters. Notably, the model already performs adequately without the calibration correction, as it is trained on miscalibrated data, making it inherently robust against misalignment errors and thus reducing the impact of the correction mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We also note that, even on the well-calibrated test set, the performance of the proposed model increases compared to the baseline; which was unexpected earlier. Upon closer investigation, we notice that in many instances our manually curated dataset has misalignment that went unnoticed. In a few cases, the alignment was accurate, and model improved in ultra long-range detections (400 meters and beyond), which further shows that LiDAR perturbation could be a powerful tool as augmentation for training.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and mitigating sensor misalignment faults, ultimately improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle’s long-range perception systems in various driving conditions.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we addressed the problem of making perception systems in autonomous vehicles robust against sensor misalignment. We proposed using a multi-task network trained with synthetic data augmentation to predict the degree of misalignment between LiDAR and camera sensors, alongside the detection task. We fuse the predictions using predicted data uncertainty and use the final output for self-correcting the input data. Finally, we evaluated the method on a large-scale, real-world dataset, perturbed with a purpose-built fault injection method, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</p>
