<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a collaborative model training method that iterates model updates by multiple clients and aggregation of the updates by a central server.
Device and statistical heterogeneity of participating clients cause significant performance degradation
so that an appropriate aggregation weight should be assigned to each client in the aggregation phase of the server.
To adjust the aggregation weights, this paper employs deep unfolding,
which is known as the parameter tuning method that leverages both
learning capability using training data like deep learning and domain knowledge.
This enables us to directly incorporate the heterogeneity of the environment of interest into the tuning of the aggregation weights.
The proposed approach can be combined with various federated learning algorithms.
The results of numerical experiments indicate that
a higher test accuracy for unknown class-balanced data can be obtained with the proposed method
than that with conventional heuristic weighting methods.
The proposed method can handle large-scale learning models with the aid of pretrained models
such that it can perform practical real-world tasks.
Convergence rate of federated learning algorithms with the proposed method is also provided in this paper.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, enables the collaborative distributed training of machine learning models
using data from many participating devices while keeping the raw data locally.
The general objective of federated learning is to collaboratively obtain a model
that can provide better predictions for unknown data
by exploiting a small amount of data from each device while preserving privacy.
It is suitable for processing personal or highly confidential data.
For example, hospitals can collaboratively train medical imaging diagnostic model
through federated learning using data stored at each hospital
without leaking data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The federated learning system comprises multiple clients
and a central server that orchestrates the learning process as the service provider.
Clients are devices or institutions with local data,
such as smartphones, edge Internet-of-Things devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
and financial and medical organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
A typical federated learning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> iterates
the following procedure:
model sharing by the server,
local model update by each client using its own local data,
and model aggregation based on the weighted averaging of the clients’ updates by the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The major challenge in obtaining better models via federated learning is
<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">heterogeneity</em> of the clients and their data.
Device heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity exist as the typical factors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, clients have different CPUs and memory configurations, and generally operate under various network conditions.
Moreover, the local data distribution is frequently not independent and identically distributed (non-IID)
because it comprises client-specific data.
Such scenarios occur in practice depending on the personal preferences or localities of the clients.
Heterogeneity causes insufficient training against comparatively minor data
and severe performance degradation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The method of solving the heterogeneity issue remains debatable, and
many researchers have attempted to obtain better models for heterogeneous environments.
These attempts are systematically summarized in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This problem has been addressed from various perspectives,
such as improving a client’s local update <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and employing sophisticated model updates at the server<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The simplest approach for a wide range of applications is to control the aggregation weights used in the server’s model aaggregation. The server aggregates the clients’ updates by performing weighted averaging with the aggregation weights assigned to each client.
McMahan et al. proposed the use of aggregation weights that are proportional only to the data quantity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
This weighting strategy seems intuitive and provides empirically stable performance.
However, these aggregation weights are not always optimal in heterogeneous environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
This strategy cannot incorporate statistical heterogeneity such as data quality or device heterogeneity such as computational capability.
Some weighting methods use information of training losses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>,
local gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>,
training accuracy, and participation frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
However, these strategies can be considered as heuristics.
In the presence of complicated heterogeneity as in an actual environment,
the effect of each factor, such as the data quantity, training loss, and participation frequency, on the learning process is unclear.
Furthermore, the magnitude of these effects is expected to vary considerably depending on the execution environments,
making it difficult to accurately estimate.
If we can use appropriate aggregation weights that accurately reflect the heterogeneity of the environment of interest,
then we expect to improve the learning performance.
Therefore, a method that
can directly adopt the heterogeneity of the environment of interest in the design of aggregation weights should be developed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the fields of signal processing and wireless communications,
methods that incorporate learning capabilities of deep learning into domain knowledge-based algorithms,
known as deep unfolding or model-based deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, have been employed to tune certain parameters included in the algorithms.
This has various applications such as sparse signal recovery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and the average consensus problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
In deep unfolding,
tunable parameters in an algorithm are trained using actual data from the system of interest as training data.
The resulting parameters, for example, yield an improved performance within a practical number of iterations of the algorithm.
This is achieved by directly incorporating the characteristics of the system of interest into the parameter tuning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the assignment of aggregation weights in federated learning,
it is challenging to properly incorporate heterogeneity of the environment of interest
with the aforementioned heuristic approaches.
To obtain appropriate aggregation weights that accurately reflect heterogeneity,
as an alternative and novel approach,
we can consider incorporating the heterogeneity directly through learning, utilizing actual data and environment of interest.
For this purpose, the technique of deep unfolding is ideally suitable for tuning aggregation weights in federated learning.
The derivation of aggregation weights by learning is expected to provide a better performance than heuristic weighting methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we employ deep unfolding to numerically optimize the assigned aggregation weights according to the heterogeneity in federated learning.
The optimization process of the aggregation weights based on deep unfolding is performed as a preprocessing phase before federated learning.
The proposed approach can be considered a kind of <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">learning-to-learn</span> or <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">meta-learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>,
which has not yet been established in the context of federated learning.
The learning procedure of federated learning can be unfolded as a deep network,
where each layer of the network comprises a process of the federated learning algorithm.
The federated learning process includes neural networks
so that the unfolded network has a nested network structure.
The aggregation weights included in the weighted averaging step by the server become trainable by using the idea of deep unfolding.
The proposed method using deep unfolding can directly adopt the heterogeneity
by using target environments as training data
whereas the data remain locally.
No other methods using the same approach exists.
Therefore, this provides a novel weighting method for federated learning.
Learning the weights to adapt to heterogeneity enables the appropriate assignment,
and the results may provide insights for developing a novel weighting strategy.
Convergence rate of federated learning algorithm with the proposed method is also provided in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">If appropriate weights depending on the environment of interest can be obtained using the proposed approach,
it may have a practical impact on challenging tasks,
such as medical data tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that require learning from a very small amount of data
and extreme classification tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, in which non-IIDness is likely to be strong.
Furthermore, we expect it to improve the performance of practical tasks using large-scale models,
which have attracted considerable interest in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
The proposed weight optimization using deep unfolding can incorporate large-scale classification models such as a vision transformer (ViT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>
with the aid of pretrained models.
The proposed approach can provide models that can perform practical image classification tasks in federated learning.
This is supported by the experimental results in this paper obtained using real data.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Non-IID data distribution is an inseparable problem in federated learning
dealing with clients’ personal data.
The factors of non-IIDness are categorized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
The effect of non-IIDness on the test performance was experimentally demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>,
which indicated that the test accuracy may decreases by 50% in non-IID environments.
Many studies have attempted to improve the performance with non-IID data
by modifying local update rules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, by using clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> or graph learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>,
or by combining with reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
These approaches are orthogonal and can be combined with the proposed weighting method.
Another context of federated learning aims to obtain a model that provides better predictions for each client’s non-IID data.

if the accuracy distribution of the model parameters is uniform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
These methods additionally use training losses of clients.
Zhao and Joshi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> recently derived a dynamic reweighting (DR) strategy that imposes penalties on clients depending on training loss.
A weighting method that considers the communication efficiency was proposed for more general scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
However, it requires calculations for all potential clients and is unsuitable for cross-device scenarios involving hundreds of clients.
The method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> uses the Sharpley value of each client at an additional cost.
Wu and Wang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a scalable weighting method called federated adaptive weighting (FedAdp)
based on the correlation between the local and global gradients.
Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed fairness and accuracy in horizontal federated learning (FedFa)
that uses training accuracy and communication frequency as measures of a client’s contribution.
FedAdp and FedFa can incorporate non-IIDness and device heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Client selection is related to the weighting strategies.
The original FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and other methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>
employ client selection,
where the central server samples clients expected to make a high contribution to the learning process more frequently as participants.
Adopting client selection can lead to the learning involving a large number of potential clients.
In practical scenarios, however, the selected clients cannot always participate in the learning process
owing to the network conditions and load status of the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.
In such cases, federated learning methods can be made even more effective and scalable
by combining client selection and weighting strategies.</p>

the objective is to improve the performance of the target algorithm or model
by tuning certain embedded parameters.
The approach that mitigates the constraints on the structure of the models and algorithms is generally called meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

the client with a large amount of data.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> clarified the following:
such weights are not suitable in heterogeneous environments from the perspective of the divergence of the model parameters
and alternative weights should be introduced to account for heterogeneity.
In heterogeneous environments, a client with more data does not necessarily contribute significantly to performance.
Specifically, when there are clients having few but unique data that are not included in other clients,
emphasizing the information from such clients may provide a model with high accuracy for unknown data distribution.
Clients with more data but low computational capabilities and/or poor network conditions
should not necessarily be emphasized.
Therefore, the heterogeneity of the clients must be reflected in the selection of the weights.

An iterative algorithm can be unfolded as a deep network
with each layer comprising a single step of the algorithm.
This enables us to tune some of the parameters included in the algorithm
by applying well-known deep learning techniques such as SGD and backpropagation to the unfolded network.
Several excellent survey papers have been published <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The procedure for deep unfolding is described as follows:
First, one identifies an iterative optimization algorithm of interest
and determines the number of iterations.
Second, the iterative algorithm is unfolded into a network, and
some trainable parameters are embedded in each layer.
Third, one prepares training data and sets a loss function for the learning process.
Finally, the trainable parameters are tuned with the training data using deep learning techniques
such that the iterative algorithm achieves the desired performance.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Note that
the data for each client can be stored locally during the proposed training process.
The clients can provide a part of or all the data for the training process.
However, they can avoid sharing raw data
by only exchanging model parameters and losses,
and performing backpropagation in terms of weights via communication.
In other words, heterogeneity such as device states, network conditions, and statistical properties of the data
can be included in the proposed training process
while also protecting privacy.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another point to note is that the proposed method incurs the overhead of preparing a dataset
and performing training as the preprocessing phase.
A tradeoff may occur between the performance improvement by learning the aggregation weights and the computational load of the overhead part,
although privacy is protected.
As long as the client is cooperative during the preprocessing
and can provide some of or all the data for the preprocessing,
a practically useful approach is
to obtain the weights
that are appropriate for the execution environment expected in an actual federated learning process in advance using the proposed method.
The proposed approach enables to obtain appropriate weights before the actual federated learning process.
Moreover, learning the appropriate weights using the proposed approach
has potential to provide insight into novel adaptive weighting rules.
By incorporating the tendency of the learned weights obtained through the proposed approach,
more robust and scalable weighting rules can be developed.</p>

Losses are accumulated during the process and sent to the server.
The weights are updated with the losses using a standard optimization method used in deep learning such as Adam.
FedAvg with the optimized weights is then performed after this preprocessing phase.
We refer to the FedAvg with the learned Deep Unfolding-based Weights (DUW) as DUW-FedAvg.</p>

A few performance differences were observed between the methods.
This is because the original FedAvg can address the quantity skew, as observed in (<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3.2 Federated Learning ‣ 3 Preliminaries ‣ Deep Unfolding-based Weighted Averaging for Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
The learned weights corresponding to each round and each client are shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Settings for MNIST Dataset ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Deep Unfolding-based Weighted Averaging for Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (e).
The figure indicates that a larger value was assigned to client <math id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="4" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">4</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">4</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">4</annotation></semantics></math>, which has more data than the others.
This behavior coincided with the weights of FedAvg.

In other words, the proposed method is suitable for adapting to the label distribution skew
that cannot be addressed using conventional methods.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed deep unfolding-based weighted averaging for federated learning
that can directly incorporate heterogeneity in an environment of interest.
The proposed approach can be combined with various federated learning algorithms
and can flexibly adapt to the complex heterogeneity of the environment.
We first evaluated the performance of the proposed DUW-FedAvg
under the assumptions of specific environments and reliable clients.
The proposed algorithm achieved better accuracy than the conventional methods,
particularly in environments with label distribution skew and computational/communication capability skew.
The learned weights behaved as adapting to the heterogeneity.
The proposed methods also could be applied to image classification task using a large-scale model.
This implies that the proposed approach has sufficient potential for handling practical tasks in real worlds.
We have theoretically shown that
the convergence rate of federated learning algorithm with the proposed method becomes comparable to that of the conventional algorithms
as long as the variance of learned weights is bounded.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed approach requires the overhead of the pre-training process,
and the computational load can be severe owing to practical reasons such as memory constraints.
Therefore, improvements in computational efficiency are required
to apply this approach to a large-scale federated learning.
For example, the cross-device context of federated learning
comprising many unreliable clients must be considered.
The improvement of the method’s scalability and robustness by combining it with client selection
will be addressed in a future study.
We can also expect that
interpretable behavior of the learned weights shown in this paper
leads to the derivation of a novel adaptive weighting strategy
with scalability and robustness.
