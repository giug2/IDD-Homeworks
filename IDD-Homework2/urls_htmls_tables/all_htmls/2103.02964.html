<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Network service federation in 5G/B5G networks enables service providers to extend service offering by collaborating with peering providers. Realizing this vision requires interoperability
among providers towards end-to-end service orchestration across multiple administrative domains. Smart admission control is fundamental to make such extended offering
profitable.
Without prior knowledge of service requests,
the admission controller (AC) either determines the domain to deploy the demand or rejects it
to maximize the long-term average profit. In this paper, we first obtain the optimal AC policy by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process, which is solved through the policy iteration method. This provides the <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">theoretical</span> performance bound under the assumption of known arrival and departure rates of demands.
Then, for practical solutions to be deployed in real systems,
where the rates are not known, we apply the Q-Learning and R-Learning algorithms to approximate the optimal policy. The extensive simulation results show that learning approaches outperform the greedy policy and are capable of getting close to optimal performance.
More specifically, R-learning always outperformed the rest of practical solutions and achieved an optimality gap of 3-5% independent of the system configuration, while Q-Learning showed lower performance and depended on discount factor tuning.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">5G and beyond networks are expected to cost-effectively provide services with diverse quality requirements. To this end, enabler technologies including Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN)
as well as architectural principles like network slicing, and multi-domain orchestration are incorporated in the architecture of the networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The variety of services and stakeholders needs the definition of management and orchestration architectures
for the cooperation of stakeholders
that is required towards end-to-end multi-domain orchestration of such services. One clear example is service federation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-domain orchestration enables the service provider, as an administrative domain, to collaborate with other domains for service provisioning in a federated environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The federation contract between the domains
provides extra resources for the consumer domain at the cost of the federation. These resources are used to deploy (segments of) the requested network services, i.e., a network slice composed of a set of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and virtual interconnecting links, in other domains
for different reasons such as the lack of sufficient local resources, load-balancing, and cost-efficiency.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The Admission Controller (AC)
is the highest-level resource manager.
For a given service demand, it either determines the domain to deploy the demand or rejects it. In this paper, we consider business profit as the objective of the admission control, and assume that there is only one provider domain with a limited reserved quota for service federation which is agreed in the federation contract.
Under these assumptions, the AC should decide where to deploy the requested services
to maximize the profit
without knowing the future demands. This problem is referred to as the Admission Control for Service Federation (ACSF). </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This problem is challenging, and trivial approaches like greedily accepting every demand do not provide the optimal solution, as shown in the simulation results.
The AC should manage the local resources of the consumer domain and the federation quota of the provider domain to maximize the profit. While several AC algorithms in 5G networks have already been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, they consider single domain networks; and consequently are not directly applicable to the ACSF problem. This is the research gap that we aim to address.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.3" class="ltx_p">Recently, AI/ML approaches have been extensively used
in communication networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
ACFS is an instance of the problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty, which can be efficiently approached by Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions where an agent learns the policy via interaction with the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The RL based admission control solutions have already been developed in other contexts rather than the multi-domain service federation problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we utilize a special category of reinforcement learning, named <span id="S1.p5.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">average reward</span> learning, to approximate the optimal policy that maximizes the average profit of the consumer domain.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the wide variety of stakeholders of future networks, service federation is expected to become a relevant component of 5G and beyond network architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, since it allows deploying complex services in multiple administrative domains, whilst enabling end-to-end orchestration. At a theoretical level, the problem of service federation is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is extended
to consider energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. From an architectural point of view, preliminary ideas of service federation were presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The full-fledged architecture enabling service federation was
developed
in the 5G-Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> platform, which is capable of deploying composite NFV network services spanning across multiple domains
and realizes the federation vision by designing the high-level concepts presented in ETSI specifications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, neither the theoretical nor the architectural research works address the admission control problem in service federation; i.e., they assume that the service has already been accepted and attempt to efficiently deploy it.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Using reinforcement learning for admission control has been the topic of several previous works. Adaptive call admission control (CAC) in multimedia networks using RL was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In the case of links with variable capacity, the CAC problem using RL was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors utilized RL for CAC in CDMA networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, admission control in cellular networks, and in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> network slice admission control were formulated as MDP. The network slice admission control in single domain networks was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
While these works approach the AC problem using RL, they cannot be applied directly to the ACSF problem since they consider single domain networks.</p>

by formulating the problem as an MDP to obtain the optimal solution and we propose a new average-reward learning algorithm that outperforms Q-Learning under all evaluated scenarios and whose performance is not as sensitive to parameter tuning (e.g., discount factor) as Q-learning.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the ACSF problem, where
the admission controller determines the domain to deploy the service or rejects it in order to maximize the profit considering the federation cost. The optimal policy under the assumption of knowing the arrival and departure rates of the demands was obtained by solving the MDP model of the problem through the policy iteration algorithm. As practical solutions, we applied the Q-Learning and R-Learning algorithms to the problem where the former maximizes the discounted rewards while the latter attempts to maximize the average reward. The extensive simulations show the excellent performance of the R-learning independent of system configuration.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future work, the next step would be
taking into account the capacity of the intra-domain links
in multiple provider domains context. These extensions will cause the exponential growth of the state space that needs to be handled by Deep RL solutions.
