<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention for addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns. While parallel FL algorithms like FedAvg exhibit remarkable performance, they face challenges in scenarios with diverse network speeds and concerns about centralized control, especially in multi-institutional collaborations like the medical domain.
Serial FL presents an alternative solution, circumventing these challenges by transferring model updates serially between devices in a cyclical manner. Nevertheless, it is deemed inferior to parallel FL in that (1) its performance shows undesirable fluctuations, and (2) it converges to a lower plateau, particularly when dealing with non-IID data. The observed phenomenon is attributed to catastrophic forgetting due to knowledge loss from previous sites. In this paper, to overcome fluctuation and low efficiency in the iterative learning and forgetting process, we introduce cyclical weight consolidation (CWC), a straightforward yet potent approach specifically tailored for serial FL.
CWC employs a consolidation matrix to regulate local optimization. This matrix tracks the significance of each parameter on the overall federation throughout the entire training trajectory, preventing abrupt changes in significant weights. During revisitation, to maintain adaptability, old memory undergoes decay to incorporate new information. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that in various non-IID settings, CWC mitigates the fluctuation behavior of the original serial FL approach and enhances the converged performance consistently and significantly. The improved performance is either comparable to or better than the parallel vanilla.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Kairouz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> has shown remarkable performance across various domains, including medicine, finance, and IoT. FL addresses the challenge of data scarcity among isolated clients, often bound by privacy regulations, by training a global model in a distributed manner, enhancing model performance while respecting data ownership. These achievements are largely credited to parallel FL algorithms like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, which involve a central server coordinating the aggregation of updated weights from participating clients iteratively until convergence. However, it’s vital to acknowledge that parallel FL may not be the optimal solution for all scenarios, especially when logistical challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and concerns regarding a centralized third party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kalra et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> are paramount. The former scenario arises when collaborators have significantly different network connection speeds or deep learning hardware, while the latter situation is particularly undesirable in multi-institutional collaborations. This is especially true in the medical domain, where each hospital may insist on autonomy over its own model to comply with regulations.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To circumvent these challenges, serial FL (i.e. CWT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chang et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. This phenomenon (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Cyclical Weight Consolidation: Towards Solving Catastrophic Forgetting in Serial Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is attributed to <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">catastrophic forgetting</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">French (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>); Goodfellow et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, where previously acquired knowledge from prior sites gradually fades as the model assimilates new information. Consequently, when the learning process at a new site concludes, the model performs well in the new data environment but at the cost of deteriorating performance on datasets from previously visited sites. The repetitive cycle of learning and forgetting leads to oscillating learning dynamics, significantly diminishing efficiency and resulting in undesirable convergence performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address catastrophic forgetting induced by heterogeneous data distribution in serial FL, prior research has employed simple heuristics such as balanced mini-batch sampling or a weighted cross-entropy loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Balachandar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work has delved into the intricate mechanism of catastrophic forgetting within the cyclical weight transfer process and provided a targeted solution. Furthermore, although serial FL bears resemblance to continual learning (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">De Lange et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Hadsell et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Parisi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, where catastrophic forgetting is also a primary concern, techniques from CL cannot be directly applied to serial FL. This disparity stems from the inherent differences between the two tasks: while CL aims to sequentially learn and adapt to new tasks over time while preserving knowledge from past experiences, serial FL distinguishes itself by cyclically revisiting previously accessed sites. This unique characteristic necessitates the development of a new anti-catastrophic forgetting design that can fully leverage this cyclic revisitation feature, thereby enhancing overall performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a straightforward yet potent approach, termed Cyclical Weight Consolidation (CWC), to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in serial federated learning. Instead of granting the model unrestricted autonomy to update itself, CWC opts for local optimization under the regularization of a consolidation matrix. This matrix encapsulates knowledge from previously visited sites, thereby preventing significant weights from undergoing abrupt changes. Following the optimization at the current site, the matrix updates itself by assimilating important weight estimations specific to that site. Given the cyclical revisitation of all sites’ data, the consolidation matrix undergoes attenuation at the onset of each new communication round, preventing permanent adherence to out-of-date knowledge and preserving the model’s adaptability. Our comprehensive evaluations illustrate that, across various non-IID settings, CWC alleviates the fluctuation behavior exhibited by the original serial FL approach and consistently and significantly enhances convergence performance. The improved performance is either comparable to or surpasses that of the parallel vanilla. In a nutshell, our contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has been proposed as a solution to address privacy concerns in distributed learning environments. In contrast to the pioneering federated method, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, which trains a global model by aggregating local model parameters concurrently, serial FL methods, exemplified by CWT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chang et al.

This sequential process continues iteratively, allowing the model to be refined over time as it incorporates insights from different clients in each round. However, serial FL is highly sensitive to data heterogeneity, leading to fluctuation behavior and lower convergence performance due to catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">French (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>); Goodfellow et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, refers to a phenomenon in machine learning and artificial intelligence where a model that has been trained on one task significantly forgets or loses its ability to perform well on a previous task when it is trained on a new, unrelated task. In other words, as the model learns new information, it unintentionally erases or overwrites previously learned knowledge, leading to a decline in performance on earlier tasks. This issue is especially prominent in continual or lifelong learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">De Lange et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Hadsell et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Parisi et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, where a model needs to adapt to new tasks over time. Proposed CL methods to overcome catastrophic forgetting can be broadly classified into three categories: rehearsal, architectural, and regularization methods. Rehearsal methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rebuffi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Rolnick et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Isele and Cosgun (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Chaudhry et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> involve storing and replaying essential samples from previous tasks during the training of a model on new tasks. This periodic revisitation of past experiences allows the model to retain knowledge about earlier tasks, thereby mitigating the risk of forgetting. However, rehearsal methods are not applicable in the context of serial FL, as they violate privacy requirements. Architectural methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Aljundi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Rusu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Xu and Zhu (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> focus on designing neural networks with separate modules or compartments dedicated to different tasks. This modular approach ensures that knowledge acquired for each task is stored in distinct compartments, reducing interference between tasks and minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Regularization techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kirkpatrick et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Zenke et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Lee et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Aljundi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> introduce constraints into the learning process to prevent the model from becoming overly specialized on the current task and forgetting previously acquired information. Despite the effectiveness of these methods in CL tasks, their direct application to serial FL is not feasible. This discrepancy stems from the inherent differences between the two tasks: while CL focuses on sequential learning and adaptation to new tasks over time while preserving knowledge from past experiences, serial FL stands out by cyclically revisiting previously accessed sites. This distinctive characteristic calls for the development of a novel anti-catastrophic forgetting design that can fully exploit this cyclic revisitation feature, thereby enhancing overall performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The native CWT algorithm encounters challenges in serial federated learning scenarios characterized by heterogeneous client data distributions. Catastrophic forgetting manifests shortly after the model is transferred to the next site and begins adapting to the new data distribution. The previously acquired knowledge from the prior sites gradually fades as the model assimilates new information. Consequently, when the learning process at the new site concludes, the model excels in the new data environment but at the expense of deteriorating performance on datasets from previously visited sites. Hence, our goal is to reduce the negative effects of catastrophic forgetting.</p>

The oscillation amplitude increases, resulting in lower convergence values. Moreover, in CIFAR10, CWT struggles to learn, evidenced by declining accuracy with increasing training epochs. In contrast, CWC, incorporating a cyclical consolidation mechanism, overcomes the inefficiency in the iterative process of learning and forgetting. This is evident in its more steadily growing trend and eventual convergence to higher accuracy. The figure also demonstrates the robustness of CWC to increasing data heterogeneity. As heterogeneity increases, the performance loss is moderate, in contrast to CWT and FedAvg. Remarkably, with cyclical weight consolidation, the serial federated learning approach becomes comparable to FedAvg and even outperforms it in highly heterogeneous scenarios (<math id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha=0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">0.01</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><cn type="float" id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">0.01</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.3.m3.1c">\alpha=0.01</annotation></semantics></math>).</p>

In contrast, CWC remains fairly stable, as illustrated by a similar trend in all four sites. This observation validates that a model trained with cyclical weight consolidation preserves the previously acquired knowledge when fitting the data from another dissimilar distribution, confirming the efficacy of our consolidation mechanism.

As observed, initially, for both serial federated learning algorithms, the on-site test score experiences an extreme fluctuation trend: after fitting the on-site training samples, it reaches up to 100%; however, when the model transitions and adapts to the data of the next site, the accuracy suddenly drops to a very low level. As the model undergoes more training epochs, the lowest value it drops to in a communication round exhibits a growing trend, indicating its ability to preserve a certain amount of the previously learned knowledge as it continually adapts to other distinct distributions. However, in CWT, the learning efficiency is extremely low, taking hundreds of communication rounds to converge to the level of 50%. Moreover, the marginal gain also decreases over time. In contrast, CWC showcases its superiority with a faster convergence speed, proving its capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge and its plasticity to learn knowledge from other data distributions.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we evaluate CWC on distributions characterized by extreme heterogeneity. The complete MNIST and CIFAR10 training datasets are partitioned into five subsets of consecutive categories, with each client assigned two consecutive categories. And we utilized the official balanced test set for model performance evaluation. Unlike the Dirichlet benchmark, there is no class overlap in the samples from different sites, posing a significant challenge for FL algorithms. The remaining configurations are maintained consistent with the Dirichlet benchmark. Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Benchmark on Extremely Heterogeneous Distribution ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Cyclical Weight Consolidation: Towards Solving Catastrophic Forgetting in Serial Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> illustrates the model performance on the official test set across different algorithms. CWC stands out by outperforming CWT and FedAvg by a considerable margin. Given that each site processes samples from mutually exclusive categories, different sites share minimal overlapping knowledge. Therefore local data optimizes the model in distinct directions, leading to substantial forgetting in CWT and notable client drift in FedAvg. Consequently, these two baseline algorithms struggle to generalize effectively. Contrastingly, CWC maintains strong performance in this benchmark, even comparable to the results obtained in Dirichlet experiments, albeit with a slight lag. The resilience of CWC under extreme heterogeneity highlights its ability to adapt and learn from diverse local data, overcoming challenges associated with the absence of shared knowledge across sites.</p>

Observing the results, an increase in the amount of local computation has no effect on the convergence speed in terms of CWT. In fact, it takes more communication rounds to reach the same preset accuracy (communication rounds increase to 41 and 50 under 2 and 8 epochs, respectively). In contrast, CWC experiences a boost in convergence speed with increased local epochs, similar to FedAvg. This is further demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.4 Impact of Local Training Epochs ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Cyclical Weight Consolidation: Towards Solving Catastrophic Forgetting in Serial Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, which shows the startup learning dynamics under the setup of 2 and 4 local epochs: After experiencing a total of four communication rounds, CWC’s test accuracy converges to a higher level with a doubling in local training epochs.</p>

From these observations, we can infer that the consolidation factor plays a crucial role in balancing resilience to previously acquired knowledge and plasticity to adapt to new knowledge. Achieving an optimal performance requires finding a delicate balance in between.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose cyclical weight consolidation to address catastrophic forgetting in serial FL. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CWC in mitigating the fluctuation behavior of the original serial FL approach and consistently achieving higher convergence performance. We illustrated that CWC can adapt to more complex datasets and larger models, as evidenced by its success in a skin disease classification task. Notably, CWC outperformed CWT and FedAvg in extremely heterogeneous distributions, showcasing its robustness in challenging scenarios where other methods fail. Furthermore, our results indicate that CWC achieves performance comparable to parallel FL, marking a significant milestone for serial FL. The capability of CWC to boost convergence by intensifying local computation provides an additional advantage not achievable in CWT. We conducted a thorough analysis of the impact of the consolidation factor, demonstrating that optimal performance in CWC relies on striking a delicate balance between resilience to prior knowledge and adaptability to incorporate new information. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of CWC as a valuable tool in serial FL, offering a robust and efficient solution to the challenges posed by non-IID data distributions and knowledge retention across diverse sites.</p>
