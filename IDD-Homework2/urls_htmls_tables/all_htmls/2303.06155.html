<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to deal with the heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) systems, a knowledge distillation (KD) driven training framework for FL is proposed, where each user can select its neural network model on demand and distill knowledge from a big teacher model using its own private dataset. To overcome the challenge of train the big teacher model in resource limited user devices, the digital twin (DT) is exploit in the way that the teacher model can be trained at DT located in the server with enough computing resources. Then, during model distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at either the physical entity or the digital agent. The joint problem of model selection and training offloading and resource allocation for users is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the problem, Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning selects models for users and determines whether to train locally or on the server, and optimization is used to allocate resources for users based on the output of Q-learning. Simulation results show the proposed DT-assisted KD framework and joint optimization method can significantly improve the average accuracy of users while reducing the total delay.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, FL attracts much attention for researchers since it can train a deep learning (DL) model with high accuracy by indirectly using the whole dataset while preserving data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Since it protects the data privacy of users, FL is widely used for neural network (NN) training in data-sensitive areas such as financial data prediction and medical data analysis. In addition, in FL systems, the user only needs to transmit the parameters of the NN to the server or a specific user to aggregate to improve the performance of the NN, the server does not need to collect data from all users, thus reducing the challenge to the storage capacity of the server when using a large dataset to train a NN with high performance. Moreover, the size of NN parameters is usually much smaller than the size of the training data, so in a poor communication state environment, using FL to only transmit the NN parameters helps to reduce the increase of the total training delay caused by the communication delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The training cost can be further reduced by proper resource management and training methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, all the above works assume the NN model in FL is homogeneous, while in the real world, there are various types of devices, and only a few are homogeneous. The different users may have different computing resources and different data even different objectives, so the service needs to be provided in a targeted manner according to the characteristics of the users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The heterogeneity of users leads to many challenges to use the same NN for all users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Firstly, the heterogeneity of computing resources causes a contradiction between training delay and accuracy in FL systems. Because in FL, the server needs to aggregate the parameters of all users’ NNs to improve NN performance, thus if all users train a big model, users with few computational resources from overly dragging down the system training latency. Meanwhile, if all users train a small model, although the training speed can be improved, the accuracy of FL decreases as the model size decreases. Secondly, the heterogeneity of data may cause the data from different users to become not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). The Non-IID dataset leads to the challenge of convergence of the NN, and the degradation of the NN performance, since in deep learning, the data is generally assumed to follow the IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Another most overlooked but important challenges is the heterogeneity of objectives for users. Obviously, the purpose of user participation in FL systems is to improve the performance of their own NN. However, most previous works focus on the improvement of average accuracy on all users’ datasets, which may lead to the degradation of accuracy on its own dataset. As a consequence, FL systems need to improve the average accuracy of the NN on all user datasets while improving the accuracy of the NN on the user’s own private dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In practical deployment scenarios, the heterogeneity of computing resources leads to straggler effect in federation learning, which severely reduces training efficiency. This is due to the fact that the computing power of different devices varies significantly, so that clients with strong computing power have to wait for those with weak computing power before performing model aggregation, resulting in a significant waste of computing resources. Therefore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> split learning (SL) is used that users with few computational resources update only a few layers of the NN while other users update more layers of NN. Obviously, the SL increases the communication burden by transmitting the intermediate results of NN between users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the heterogeneity of user computing resources, the heterogeneity of data especially the Non-IID dataset also attracts much attention. Because the heterogeneous data leads to different optimization directions of weights for different models, which is the main reason for the accuracy loss. Therefore, data-based schemes improve model performance by modifying the data distribution. Zhao <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. proposed to pre-train the global model by using a small amount of uniformly distributed shared data and distributing the shared data to the client to train the local model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Experiments have shown that even a very small amount of shared data can significantly improve model accuracy. However, this approach of modifying data distribution is often difficult to implement because it is difficult to obtain uniform shared data in practical situations, and constructing shared data increases the risk of user privacy leakage. In addition, users can fine-tune the global model based on client data to obtain a personalized model that performs well on local datasets. Fallah <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. proposed to use agnostic meta-learning to obtain the initial global model, and users can obtain high accuracy with a small amount of training based on their own data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Arivazhagan <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. proposed to use personalizing layers in the client model, thus greatly improving the model’s adaptability to local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Ma <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. achieve personalized model aggregation by discerning the importance of each network layer in different customer models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Although these approaches achieve good results on Non-IID data, they all increase the training overhead and do not enable personalizing of the model framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To jointly solve the heterogeneity of computing resources, data, and objectives, some works propose to use knowledge distillation (KD) in FL systems. As a promising technology, KD achieves success in many fields, since it can transfer knowledge in a big well-trained NN, named teacher model, to an arbitrary small NN, named student model, by providing the outputs of the big NN as soft labels for student model and using these soft labels as an additional gradient to train the student model. Therefore, the performance of the student model can be improved. Since in the KD method arbitrary NN can be used as a student model, thus different users can select the different models on demand in FL systems. Therefore, by using the KD method, the straggle in the training procedure of FL can be avoided. Because the NNs are not the same between different users, thus there is no need to directly aggregate the NNs of different users, even if the user with more computational resources performs several more training epochs, there is no gradient confusion among different user NNs. Moreover, in KD only the output of the teacher model is needed to transmit thus the transmission burden is much less than SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Li <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. combine migration learning and knowledge refinement for personalized federal learning, and each customer can use private data and a specific model for training. Zhou <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. proposed distilled one-shot federated learning (DOSFL), thus significantly reducing communication costs while ensuring model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Although the KD enables users to select different models based on their demands, however, in KD, a big teacher model is needed, and training such a model usually relay on a huge dataset. Therefore, just using one user’s limited dataset cannot train the teacher model well. However. the teacher model is usually too big to train in users’ CPU. Thus, it cannot simply use the FL method to train the teacher model. As a consequence, previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> mainly relay on the public dataset in the server to train the teacher model in the server. Moreover, if the teacher model is too big, it is challenging for users to run the teacher model to distil the knowledge not only by the limited memory resource to store the huge parameters of the teacher model but also by the large latency to run the teacher model in users CPU.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, the evolving digital twin (DT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> technology can be used to solve these two challenges of no public dataset and users cannot run the teacher model. In DT a digital copy, named twin, all entities and information in physical space is established in a server with adequate computing resources to help improve strategies for physical space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In order to protect the privacy of physical entities, without authorization, only physical entities can access the information of their corresponding twins but not the information of the twins of other physical entities in the digital space, and twins cannot access each other twins’ information if they are not authorized by the corresponding physical entities. Therefore, users can safely copy their own datasets and NN parameters to the twin. Moreover, due to the adequate computing resources on the server, the teacher model can be stored and run on the server. In the beginning, the teacher model can be trained as FL by using the data from twins of users. Then users can purchase the computing resource from the server to get the output of the teacher model and thus train their own student model as the KD method. Moreover, to deal with the heterogeneity of users’ objectives, each user only uses their own private dataset to train student models. Therefore, not only the average accuracy of student models on all datasets is improved by learning the general knowledge from the teacher model, but also the accuracy of student model on its own dataset is significantly enhanced since only each user’s private dataset is used to distillate the knowledge from teacher model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Since users may choose to train a small model locally to reduce the cost of purchasing computational resources, as a result, it is important to select appropriate student models for different users to balance the trade-off of the accuracy of NN and the training delay and the training cost, and then based on the selected model determine whether training the student model locally or on the server and purchase appropriate resources to reduce the training delay and training cost. The delay and resource consumption can be effectively reduced by a reasonable scheduling strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Obviously, selecting student models and offloading for all users is a discrete optimization problem, while resource management is a continuous optimization problem. It is challenging for traditional convex optimization to solve such a mixed integer problem. Although Q-learning achieves success in discrete optimization problems and has been proved to always achieve Bellman optimal solutions after training a sufficient number of epochs in discrete optimization problems with limited action space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, for problems with continuous action space Q-learning usually performs not well or even fails to converge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore in this paper, we propose the DT-assisted KD framework to enable different users can select different student models on demand, then a joint optimization method of Q-learning and convex optimization method is used to determine the model selection and offloading and resource management. Remarkably, to couple Q-learning and convex optimization, in the training procedure, the reward of Q-learning is determined by the output of convex optimization. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with heterogeneity of data and objective, the teacher model is first trained by the data copy in digital space of all users in a FL method, thus the teacher model can extract the general knowledge from all dataset. Then in the training procedure of each user model, only the user private dataset is used to distill the knowledge from teacher model. Therefore, the user model can not only learn the general knowledge of all users dataset from teacher model, but also focus on learn the personalized knowledge from the user private dataset, since only private data is used in training.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, in KD, the big teacher model is well-trained in advance. However, due to the heterogeneity of user computing resource, in this paper, we assume the teacher model is too big to train by the user. Inspired by the feature of digital twin (DT), a DT-assisted KD framework is proposed to enable the training of teacher model and selecting different model for different users. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the digital twin system can establish a digital copy, named a twin, of the total entities and data in physical space. Therefore, users can create a data backup in the digital space. Meanwhile, to protect the privacy of user data, twins in the digital space are not allowed to exchange the user’s private data with other twins or share data with other users in the physical space. However, in order to share the data indirectly, using the data to train NN is allowed in the twin, since in the training procedure the data is always stored in the twin and when the training is finished other users and twins can only get a NN with trained parameters or gradient. Therefore, the teacher model can be trained on the total dataset to get high performance. Then the KD can be used and the teacher model can provide an additional gradient to the small NN, called the student model, in the user, thus improving the performance of the student model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.7" class="ltx_p">In order to fully utilize both user and server computing power, users can choose to train their own student models by using local computing power or by the server computing power on demand. Regardless of which method a user chooses to train the student model, the training overhead is composed of both latency and resource price. If the user trains the student model by using its own computing power, in the training procedure, the user needs to wait for the server to transmit the results calculated by the teacher model to the user first. Then the user uses the results of the teacher model and the labels of the dataset to update the parameters of the student model locally by the back-propagation algorithm. Since the features of the twin in the digital twin system need to be guaranteed to be consistent with the features of the entities in the physical space, the user also needs to transmit the updated parameters of the student model to the server to ensure that the features of the entities in the digital space and the physical space are consistent. Therefore, the delay in training the student model locally consists of computational latency of the teacher model <math id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T_{tea}"

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.9" class="ltx_p">Obviously, Problem 1 is a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, thus it is challenging to use the traditional convex optimization method to optimize the problem with discrete variables efficiently. Since we can simultaneously select student models for all users, in this way, selecting student models for the current users does not have an effect on the selection of student models for other users. Therefore, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the student model selection can be formulated as a Markov decision procession (MDP) without state transition probability.
Although Q-learning achieves success in discrete optimization problems both in efficiency and performance, it is challenging for it to solve the problem with continual optimization variables.

Although there are many deep neural networks (DNN)-based reinforcement learning methods, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> and proximal policy optimization (PPO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, which can jointly optimize the discrete and continual variables, the training of the DNN can be time-consuming. It is unnecessary to train a DNN-based RL first, and then use this DNN model to optimize the training of FL. Moreover, the inferencing time of DNN-based methods to get the optimized variables is also long, which cannot be simply ignored in delay-sensitive tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, thus increasing the total processing time. As for the Q-learning, we can further store the Q-Table as a Hash-Table.

Thus Problem 1 can be decomposed into two subproblems: 1) choosing a student model for each user and determining whether it is trained with user arithmetic or server arithmetic, which can be solved by Q-learning; and 2) assigning appropriate computational and bandwidth resources to each user, which can be solved by convex optimization. Since both Q-learning and convex optimization can get the solution quickly, the influence of the inferencing time of the algorithm can be ignored. As a consequence, Q-learning is used to solve the problem as follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge distillation (KD) is a neural network model compression technique based on teacher-student network structure. It has been widely used recently due to its excellent performance and high compatibility with other deep learning techniques. Usually, there are differences in the performance of models of different scales. Models with more parameters and high computational complexity are able to obtain higher accuracy than smaller models. However, due to the limitations of device computing and storage capacity, as well as specific task requirements, it is not possible to deploy large models in many cases. Therefore, KD is used to compress the model while minimizing the loss of accuracy, and can also be considered as a way to use a large model to improve the performance of a small model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To apply KD, a robust teacher model is necessary. Training a teacher model requires powerful computing power and memory that cannot be satisfied by the client. Therefore, we use digital twin technology to copy user data to the digital domain and train the teacher model using the server. We use FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> to train the teacher model, and aggregate the gradients to update the global model after each user finishes computing on a batch of data. Due to the high heterogeneity of users’ private data, we set the batch size to the size of the private dataset to enhance the stability and accuracy of model convergence. As a result, the full user data is used for each parameter update, thus avoiding the performance degradation caused by aggregating the model parameters in different optimization directions. It should be noted that although this approach can obtain a highly accurate teacher model with guaranteed data security, it consumes a large amount of computing power and storage space.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the great success of KD in many areas, there is still a significant gap between the performance of the teacher model and the student model, and the performance improvement of the student model relies heavily on the appropriate model framework and the rationality of the hyperparameter values. To further improve the performance of student models, several advanced distillation schemes have been proposed. These schemes perform deeper knowledge extraction and employ more refined knowledge representation methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. However, they have stringent requirements on the model framework and their training process tends to be more complex. Distillation of multiple significantly different student models using the same teacher model is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance while training multiple teacher models for different student models incurs significant overhead. Moreover, for complex tasks with high training difficulty, the gains obtained by relying only on soft targets for distillation are insufficient. Therefore, we use a more powerful and simple distillation method (simKD) that reuses the linear output layer of the teacher model for deeper knowledge extraction<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p5.4" class="ltx_p">Usually, the classification model relies on an encouder consisting of several hierarchical structures connected by elaborate design for feature extraction, thus transforming low-level features of images into high-level features and finally outputting classification results through linear layers. This feature extraction capability is required by the model to process a variety of images so that a model trained on a specific dataset can be migrated to other datasets with only fine-tuning of the parameters to achieve good performance. The classification accuracy of a model depends heavily on its feature extraction capability, so most of the existing work has focused on designing more efficient feature extraction structures. For different models, most of their computational effort comes from the feature extraction part, while the linear layer used as the classifier accounts for only a small percentage. Therefore, in order to make the student model approximate the performance of the teacher model as much as possible, we match the student model with the teacher model in terms of features, and the objective function of the student model is defined as</p>

To further improve the accuracy of the student model and reduce the training overhead, the student model is made to directly reuse the linear layer of the teacher model to ensure that it can perform correct classification based on the learned feature knowledge. Since the linear layers of our chosen models have the same or similar structure, the computational complexity of the student model remains almost unchanged.</p>

To demonstrate the ability of the proposed DT-assisted KD training method (KD) to adapt to heterogeneous data and devices, we choose four models of different sizes to match the client devices. Specifically, VGG-8, ResNet-8x4, ResNet-14x4, and ResNet-26x4 are used as student models and ResNet-32x4 as the teacher model, and the performance is tested on datasets with different distributions. The time of training student model for one epoch with unit giga CPU frequency is 6.83s, 8.75s, 12.27s and 18.96s respectively.</p>

It can be observed that both KD and conventional FL achieve good performance, while the accuracy of the student model trained alone is poor. This is due to the fact that the first two methods are able to rely on a strong teacher model or other student models to update their own parameters and broaden the knowledge sources of the model, thus effectively improving the model performance. In contrast, training student models based on their own data only leads to a severe limitation in model accuracy due to the lack of training data volume.

To illustrate the detrimental effect of heterogeneous datasets on accuracy, we examine the accuracy of the model on the original test data and the heterogeneous test data, respectively. The original dataset contains all 100 kinds of test images, and the heterogeneous dataset only extracts 25 kinds of images that match the training data. Since the traditional FL needs to aggregate the parameters of the models from different clients, the accuracy of the model on the heterogeneous test set is comparable to that of the original test set. Obviously, FL fails to converge at all on the heterogeneous dataset. Even after 100 epochs of training, the classification accuracy is still around <math id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">1\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which is basically the same as that of random classification. This result is consistent with the findings of Sattler <em id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Although the FL method is set up for a federation learning scenario, it only considers the IID data distribution among clients. In this case, the expectation of the empirical risk function across clients is usually considered to be an unbiased estimate of the expectation of the total data. The above results demonstrate that good performance can be achieved using the FL method. However, the unbiasedness in the above assumptions no longer holds in the Non-IID case. As a result, the weights of the model are updated in different directions for different clients during the training process. Since traditional FL uses weight averaging to aggregate the parameters of each model, the Non-IID data distribution makes it no longer convergent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">While the proposed KD-driven method shows good adaptability on the Non-IID dataset. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation schemes, simKD aims at making the student model learn the feature extraction capabilities of the teacher model. In the Non-IID case, the student model has only 25 training labels, meaning that the labels of the remaining 75 images are always zero for the classifier. This leads the model to reduce the classification probability of these 75 images as much as possible during training in order to obtain higher training accuracy. Therefore, it leads to a significant decrease in the accuracy of the model on the complete test data. This problem is largely alleviated by making the student model reuse the classifier of the teacher model and perform deep feature alignment. This is because in image recognition tasks, the operations performed to extract features from different images are often similar, while the classifier must learn based on a specific image class. The accuracy of the training set illustrates that the KD-driven method can converge quickly and has good stability. It can be seen that the accuracy on the heterogeneous test set is significantly higher than that on the original dataset, which is due to the fact that dividing the dataset keeps the distribution of test and training data consistent, while the class and total number of images are greatly reduced. Therefore, the training difficulty of the model decreases. In this case, KD is able to achieve a <math id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="14\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">14</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">14</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">14\%</annotation></semantics></math> performance improvement compared to STU.

The final accuracy achieved by different models varies, which is determined by the representational power of the models themselves.
In addition, the models converge faster when trained on IID data than Non-IID data. This is because the number of images is the same for both data, and the difference in the distribution between the heterogeneous training sets and test sets increases the difficulty of training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of the proposed joint optimization of Q-learning and convex optimization, we compare it with the other three methods. The Q-learning only uses the Q-learning to select student models and allocate resources for all users, by comparing with this method the effectiveness of jointly using convex optimization can be proved. The FL-Min and FL-Max simply choose the same minimum/maximum student models for all users and then use the Q-learning to determine the offloading method and convex optimization to allocate resources, by comparing these two methods the importance of selecting a different model for different users can be shown.

Moreover, according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, in problems with finite discrete action spaces, Q-learning always converges to the Bellman optimal solution after adequate training epochs.

However, if Q-learning is used to jointly select student models and allocate resources, the action space of the problem will be infinite, since <math id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml">f</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1">𝑓</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.6.m6.1c">f</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="b" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">b</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1.1">𝑏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.7.m7.1c">b</annotation></semantics></math> are continuous values. Therefore, it is challenging for Q-learning to achieve high performance, and the Q-learning only method always has lower performance than proposed joint optimization methods. Remarkably, although the Q-learning only method is worse than joint optimization, due to the resources management, it is always better than FL-Max and FL-Min with the best resources allocation scheme. This phenomenon reveals the importance of choosing different student models for devices with heterogeneous computing resources. The FL-Min always has a minimum average delay in training one epoch due to the low transmission delay and training delay caused by the minimum model size.</p>

This is because large models have a greater ability to extract general features of the dataset, as a result, its performance on a specific dataset may not be as good as that of a small model due to the effect of average features. Due to the heterogeneous objectives of the users, the student model needs to achieve good performance on the user’s own private dataset, thus the Q-learning-based model selection algorithm rarely selects the largest ResNet-26x4 as the student model since the its accuracy on user’s private dataset is poor.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the problem of heterogeneity of data, computing resources, and objectives for users in FL systems. We have proposed a DT-assisted KD framework so that different users can select different NN models in FL systems. Then, we have jointly used Q-learning and convex optimization to select NN models and allocate resources for each user. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework and joint optimization method. Our work can offer valuable insights into the importance yet the under-explored field of heterogeneity in FL systems, and give a promising application for DT technology. In future work, we will focus on the distributed optimization method to solve the problem of model selection and resource management.</p>
