<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has proved to be a powerful framework to enable private cooperative learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Indeed, federated learning allows a set of agents to pool their resources together to train a more accurate model than any single agent could. This is accomplished by relying on a central coordinator that iteratively collects and aggregates locally trained models – without the need to share raw data.
Federated learning has been successfully deployed in different applications, including healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, mobile devices, Internet-of-Things, and sensor networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, power systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and intelligent transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, to name a few.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Clearly, all these applications may involve potentially sensitive and/or proprietary training data. Therefore, a fundamental challenge in the federated set-up is to <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">guarantee the privacy of these data</span> throughout the learning process.
However, despite the fact that in a federated architecture the agents are not required to share raw data, various attacks have emerged to extract private information from the trained model or its predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Thus, employing the federated learning architecture is not sufficient to ensure privacy, and tailored techniques need to be developed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides privacy preservation, another fundamental challenge in federated learning is the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">expensiveness of communications</span>.
Indeed, the models exchanged by the agents are oftentimes high dimensional, especially when training (deep) neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, resulting in resource-intensive communications.
Thus, one of the most important objectives is to design federated learning algorithms that employ as few communications as possible, while still guaranteeing good accuracy of the trained model.
Different heuristics have been proposed to accomplish this objective, with the main ones arguably being <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partial participation<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note"><span id="footnote1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">1</span></span><span id="footnote1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">A.k.a. </span><span id="footnote1.9" class="ltx_text">client selection</span><span id="footnote1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">.</span></span></span></span></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local training</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and quantization/compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In this paper we will focus on the former two, which we review in the following.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As the name suggests, when applying partial participation only a subset of the agents is selected at each iteration to communicate their local models to the coordinator. This allows to reduce the number of agent-coordinator communications required, at the cost of potentially slower convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Local training proposes a complementary approach, by aiming to increase the time between communication rounds. The idea is for the agents to perform multiple epochs of local training (<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> via stochastic gradient descent) for each round of communication.
However, this may result in worse accuracy, especially due to the <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client drift</span> phenomenon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Indeed, locally trained models may be biased by the use of data that are not representative of the overall distribution, thus leading to a drift that cannot be corrected by the coordinator.
In this paper we will therefore focus on designing a federated learning algorithm that allows for both partial participation and local training – without compromising accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Summarizing the discussion above,
the objective of this paper is two-fold. On the one hand, we are interested in designing a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm. On the other hand, we require that such algorithm employs partial participation and local training to reduce the number of communications, but without affecting accuracy.
The approach we propose to pursue these objectives is to leverage local training to enhance privacy, highlighting the synergy of communication reduction and privacy.
In particular, we offer the following contributions:

In particular, the algorithm allows for a subset of the agents to activate randomly at each iteration, and communicate the results of local training to the coordinator. The number of local training epochs is a tunable parameter of the algorithm.
Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to both smooth and composite problems (with a smooth and non-smooth part).</p>

This results shows that the use of local training does not give rise to the client drift phenomenon, and thus it does not degrade accuracy of the trained model.
Additionally, we analyze Fed-PLT’s convergence when the agents employ accelerated gradient descent for local training, showing the flexibility of the proposed approach.</p>

We then highlight the privacy benefits of using local training with a noisy solver. In particular, we characterize the differential privacy of the disclosed final model, as a function of the number of local training epochs and the gradient noise.</p>

We observe that the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm, in this example, is smaller than all other alternatives.
We then analyze Fed-PLT by discussing its performance for different values of the tunable parameters and number of agents. One interesting observation is that the convergence rate is not a monotonically decreasing function of the number of local epochs (as may be suggested by Fed-PLT’s foundation in the Peaceman-Rachford splitting). Rather, there exists an optimal, finite number of epochs.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">(Private) federated learning is an active and growing area of research, and providing a comprehensive overview of the literature is outside the scope of this paper. In the following, we provide a brief overview of privacy in federated learning, and discuss the state of the art in federated algorithms employing local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different privacy techniques have been proposed, with the most studied being homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, secret-sharing protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The latter stands out as easier to implement as compared to the other two methodologies.
This is indeed the case as in differential privacy the aim is to obscure local training data by introducing perturbations to the models shared by the agents. This is achieved by simply randomizing learning algorithms with additive noise (often following a normal or Laplace distribution). But despite the simplicity of such privacy mechanism, DP provides a solid framework that enables the derivation of theoretical privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
We remark that recently, the use of random additive noise to improve privacy has also been complemented with other techniques such as quantization and compression of communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This is similar to the concept of employing local training to enhance privacy, as explored in this paper.
Owing to its effectiveness, differential privacy has been fruitfully applied in diverse engineering fields, ranging from federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and distributed optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, to control system design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and consensus-seeking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Thus we will follow these works in using DP throughout this paper.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p5.4" class="ltx_p">Turning now to the local training, we can classify algorithms based on the solvers that can be applied by the agents. For <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> only (stochastic) gradient descent is allowed, while Fed-PLT also allows for accelerated (S)GD and noisy GD (to enhance privacy). Only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> potentially allows for a broader class of solvers, provided that they verify a specific descent inequality.

Local training requires that, before a round of communications, each agent perform multiple steps (or epochs) of minimization of the local loss function.
Employing local training, however, may result in worse accuracy, especially when the loss functions of the agents are heterogeneous. The objective then is to design federated algorithms that perform local training without jeopardizing accuracy of the trained model, see <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The devices involved in the federated learning process may be in general very heterogeneous as regards to computational, storage, and communication capabilities. Indeed, these devices may be equipped with very different hardware (CPU, memory, battery), and they may be using different network connectivity (mobile or Wi-Fi) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The heterogeneity of the agents’ resources implies that they may perform local computations, and transmit their results, at different rates. This results in <span id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partial participation</span>, with only a subset of the agents being active at any given time.
Besides arising from practical limitations, partial participation may also be enforced in order to relieve the communication burden.
The goal therefore is to design a federated algorithm that allows for partial participation while preserving accuracy of the trained model.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The leakage of private information through machine learning models’ parameters and predictions has been extensively documented <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. One notable example is the support vector machine (SVM) in its dual form, where the solution involves a linear combination of specific data points. Recently, there has been a growing interest in iterative randomized training algorithms that offer privacy-preserving guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, such as RDP and ADP. However, the existing results suffer from privacy loss that increases over training epochs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and fail to support local training and the partial participation of heterogeneous agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. These limitations make it challenging to extend those approaches to the specific setup addressed in this work. The objective of this study is to address these challenges by providing a rigorous privacy-preserving guarantee that remains bounded over time and is compatible with the federated learning setup under consideration.</p>

On the one hand, the heterogeneity of the agents’ hardware (CPU, battery, connectivity, …) may result in different paces of local training. This means that not all agents will conclude their computations at the same time, and the coordinator will receive new results only from those that did.
On the other hand, partial participation can be introduced by design in order to reduce the communication burden. In this case, the coordinator picks a (random) subset of the agents and requests that they send the new results of local training, thus reducing the number of communications exchanged. This scheme is often referred to as <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client selection</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

Notice that Fed-PD, FedLin, TAMUNA, LED are not designed to use accelerated gradient, but a straightforward modification allows for it. And interestingly, they do achieve convergence, even though there are no theoretical guarantees of it.
Another observation is that the convergence rate increases when partial participation is applied. This is in line with previous results on decentralized optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>.
Finally, it is interesting to notice that the use of gradient descent as local solver yields often lower convergence rates than accelerated gradient descent. A possible explanation is that the overall convergence is not dominated by the convergence rate of the local solver. For example in the case of Fed-PLT, the convergence may be dominated by <math id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\zeta" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ζ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝜁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">\zeta</annotation></semantics></math>, the convergence rate of the exact PRS (cf. <a href="#Thmproposition1" title="Proposition 1 (Algorithm 1 is contractive). ‣ V-A Contractiveness of Algorithm 1 ‣ V Convergence Analysis ‣ Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning through Local Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Proposition</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>
